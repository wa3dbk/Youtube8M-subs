00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
general for well because we learned by

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.650 
general for well because we learned by
playing<00:02:34.710> search<00:02:35.130> today<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.270> first<00:02:36.390> few

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
playing search today the first few

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.150 
playing search today the first few
actually<00:02:37.020> didn't<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.320> very<00:02:37.350> well<00:02:37.620> did<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
actually didn't go very well did that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.880 
actually didn't go very well did that
yeah<00:02:38.340> not<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.240> be<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.140> only<00:02:40.260> lost<00:02:40.530> one

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
yeah not to be I think we only lost one

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.940 
yeah not to be I think we only lost one
but<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.760> fair<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:43.110> didn't<00:02:43.380> win<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.710> others

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
but to be fair we didn't win the others

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.420 
but to be fair we didn't win the others
too<00:02:44.160> easily<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.770> definitely<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:47.190> bit

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
too easily so there is definitely a bit

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.950 
too easily so there is definitely a bit
of<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> different<00:02:48.120> strategy<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
of a different strategy that you have to

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.500 
of a different strategy that you have to
use<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.470> yeah<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> new<00:02:50.970> set<00:02:51.270> rep

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
use in it yeah with the new set rep

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
use in it yeah with the new set rep
they're<00:02:51.900> dead<00:02:52.440> silence<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.490> really

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they're dead silence and it's really

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.810 
they're dead silence and it's really
changed<00:02:54.270> we<00:02:54.480> use<00:02:55.470> both<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.010> those<00:02:56.190> perhaps<00:02:56.670> a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
changed we use both of those perhaps a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.420 
changed we use both of those perhaps a
centrist<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.630> hazards<00:02:58.560> definitely<00:02:59.160> opened

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
centrist and hazards definitely opened

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.910 
centrist and hazards definitely opened
up<00:02:59.550> room<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.270> new<00:03:00.420> strategy<00:03:00.990> yeah<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:01.709> um

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
