00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
world development in the first book did

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.359 
world development in the first book did
that<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> easier<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> second<00:01:05.309> book

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
definitely I mean it takes place in a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
definitely I mean it takes place in a
slightly<00:01:09.869> different<00:01:10.020> world<00:01:10.560> same<00:01:10.890> planet<00:01:11.220> but

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
slightly different world same planet but

different part of the world and I
learned<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:15.180> mistakes<00:01:15.630> from

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
learned so much from my mistakes from

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
learned so much from my mistakes from
writing<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> first<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.369> more

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
writing the first one I was so much more

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510 
writing the first one I was so much more
careful<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> second<00:01:18.659> book<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
careful with the second book and I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
careful with the second book and I
really<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> approached<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.960> trying<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
really kind of approached it trying to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
really kind of approached it trying to
make<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> landscape<00:01:24.090> part<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> mood<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
make the landscape part of the mood of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.940 
make the landscape part of the mood of
the<00:01:25.170> book<00:01:26.000> no<00:01:27.000> question<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the book no question it it was a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
the book no question it it was a
disaster<00:01:29.640> writing<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.240> book<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.570> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
disaster writing the first book to be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660 
disaster writing the first book to be
perfectly<00:01:31.170> honest<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
perfectly honest it was so out of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.080 
perfectly honest it was so out of
control<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.930> learned<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
control and I learned a lot from that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
control and I learned a lot from that
and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> mean<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.390> inspired<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.470> world<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and I mean what inspired this world that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.160 
and I mean what inspired this world that
your<00:01:38.189> books<00:01:38.400> take<00:01:38.640> place<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.930> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
your books take place in you know it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
your books take place in you know it's
funny<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.220> completely

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
funny because I don't completely

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
funny because I don't completely
remember<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:43.079> comes<00:01:43.470> first<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.860> me<00:01:44.009> his

they came with their powers intact so I

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.580 
they came with their powers intact so I
knew<00:02:54.850> well<00:02:55.120> clearly<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> fantasy

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
knew well clearly this is a fantasy

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.820 
knew well clearly this is a fantasy
novel<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:58.000> kind<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.739> spiraled<00:02:59.739> from

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
novel and it just kind of spiraled from

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.820 
novel and it just kind of spiraled from
there<00:03:00.390> one<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.540> key<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.989> guess<00:03:02.290> elements<00:03:02.739> in

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
there one of the key I guess elements in

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.930 
there one of the key I guess elements in
your<00:03:02.950> book<00:03:03.070> fire<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.459> really<00:03:03.610> sets<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.850> apart

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
your book fire that really sets it apart

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
your book fire that really sets it apart
is<00:03:04.180> how<00:03:04.300> visual<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.950> challenge

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
is how visual it is was it a challenge

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.100 
is how visual it is was it a challenge
to<00:03:06.489> write<00:03:06.700> words<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.540> could<00:03:07.660> create<00:03:07.870> such

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
to write words that could create such

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.630 
to write words that could create such
strong<00:03:08.350> images<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.890> your<00:03:08.980> readers<00:03:09.280> yeah

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
strong images for your readers yeah

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.430 
strong images for your readers yeah
that's<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.940> good<00:03:10.090> question<00:03:10.330> um<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.810> actually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that's a good question um it actually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.310 
that's a good question um it actually
wasn't<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.459> difficult<00:03:15.730> as<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.360> anticipated<00:03:16.600> it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
wasn't as difficult as I anticipated it

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.220 
wasn't as difficult as I anticipated it
was<00:03:17.440> going<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.890> be<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:20.019> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
was going to be just because that it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.229 
was going to be just because that it
became<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.890> much<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.100> part<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.670> mood<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
became so much a part of the mood of the

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.449 
became so much a part of the mood of the
book<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.170> really<00:03:23.500> got<00:03:23.680> myself<00:03:23.920> into<00:03:24.250> that

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
book and I really got myself into that

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.280 
book and I really got myself into that
mood<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.970> listened<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.330> music<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.959> got<00:03:26.140> me

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
mood and I listened to music that got me

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.500 
mood and I listened to music that got me
into<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.620> mood<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:29.200> know<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.470> just

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
into that mood and and you know it just

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.960 
thing trying to figure out all that sort
of<00:05:04.360> stuff<00:05:05.760> it's<00:05:06.760> definitely<00:05:08.490> I'm<00:05:09.490> at<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:09.760> point
