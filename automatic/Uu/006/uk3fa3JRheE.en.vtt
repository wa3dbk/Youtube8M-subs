my favorite part potato wasn't that bad

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.800 
my favorite part potato wasn't that bad
but<00:02:42.500> everything<00:02:43.040> else<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.810> also

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
but everything else is just this also

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.390 
but everything else is just this also
has<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.140> tie<00:02:45.290> between<00:02:45.350> carrot<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.040> green<00:02:46.190> bean
