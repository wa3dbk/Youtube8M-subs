the<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.229> beauty<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.159> try<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the other beauty of this is we try to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
the other beauty of this is we try to
get<00:01:41.670> 5<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.270> 7<00:01:42.630> servings<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> fruits<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
get 5 to 7 servings of fruits and
vegetables<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.369> every<00:01:44.909> day<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> think

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
vegetables in every day and if you think

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
vegetables in every day and if you think
about<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> sometimes

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
about that that's a lot and sometimes

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.240 
about that that's a lot and sometimes
that<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.210> rather<00:01:48.450> hard<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that can be rather hard to do and if it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
that can be rather hard to do and if it
were<00:01:50.340> our<00:01:50.520> kids<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.210> probably<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.840> 12

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
were our kids they could probably do 12

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
were our kids they could probably do 12
servings<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.040> fruit<00:01:53.430> every<00:01:53.850> day<00:01:54.090> but
