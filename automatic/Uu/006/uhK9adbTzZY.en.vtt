00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:16.740
 is laelson adriele da silva 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.350
 I am 27 years old in October 2012 I 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:27.029
 I had a generalized infection 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 this infection of origin in the kidney and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.390
 first day lage became generalized and she 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 has brought a lot to use recording is all in all 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:46.469
 because in hospital 64 days in that 64 days 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.809
 when the 53 in the uti and 20 of them went in 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.539
 with the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.800
 in those first 20 days were in coma 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.379
 the infection brought her many years the glass 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.239
 I had almost no respiratory 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.660
 the entire period of sixty-four days 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.589
 I got a mechanical respirator 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.950
 I had two stops 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.650
 some cardiorespiratory 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.060
 insufficiency of some organs, the organs 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.689
 vital consequences and one of the consequences 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.310
 infection was the lack of circulation of the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.310
 blood at the extremities of the body 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.150
 then this lack of circulation together with 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.750
 the lack of oxygenation caused the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.549
 My feet do not cross my feet. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 were the most affected 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.860
 the feet did not cross all over and I had 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.240
 that to make the amputation of them is a father 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.590
 also points from a few fingers and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.850
 that's it 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.009
 summarizing my story is this 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 I left the hospital on January 4, 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.890
 2013 and from there I went in search of 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.649
 rehabilitation 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 when I left the hospital I lost everyone 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.560
 the movements 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.640
 my body while I was there to stay 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.080
 much the layer is I left without movement 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.410
 demonstrates some 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 so I the first few months was very 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.230
 rehabilitation is muscular is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.750
 and two months after I left the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.580
 hospital along with the qualifications 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.739
 what was he doing 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.720
 I already went to look for some sport because 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.569
 I know sport would help mine. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 rehabilitation faster 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.420
 then on the second - I've already started I searched 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 a team that is focused on the sport 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.380
 adapted in my city and is hence 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 call penalty and from there I did not call 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.940
 one more strives 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.000
 I started doing athletics and swimming 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.640
 I still did not wear prostheses and even 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.150
 so I went after the sport was in the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.650
 wheelchair and 5 even after 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.890
 has discharge 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 I gain more muscle strength 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.609
 so I could behind the prophesy sound 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.090
 so in May of 2003 neither I went behind 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:24.750
 the troops have already begun treatment for 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.670
 the use of it is to speak of my 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.750
 rehabilitation with the troops was 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140
 too fast 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.310
 although it is still very weak in 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.769
 five days 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.690
 The clinic has already freed me to go home. 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:43.350
 alone with her and is already making an 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.530
 day to day and from there it was 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.389
 improvement was also faster. 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.109
 that's where I started to do the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.220
 also with prostheses and not 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.019
 I stopped more 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.130
 in that first year that I left the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.870
 hospital 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.079
 I very much went back in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.650
 rehabilitation of what I have had several 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.940
 motor limitation muscle rehabilitation 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 rehabilitation of my grandmother 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.810
 it was a very 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.700
 rehabilitation in 2014 I was already 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.600
 Totally fine, I had reestablished myself 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.470
 only of the health problem that I had 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.880
 in 2014 I started in competitions for the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.070
 I answered several of something 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.100
 more street races 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.810
 I already participated in sant''anna is by 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.230
 athletics and it was a very good year for 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.540
 me because I've met many people and 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:53.210
 I have many opportunities through 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.550
 of sports also at the end of 2014 in 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.680
 September 2014 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.980
 I won a prosthesis will be corrected 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.730
 specific for racing and this prosthesis 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.890
 will also be helping me a lot 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.560
 was another deputy who received the ego 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.810
 not just shit 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.380
 I am very grateful also for this person 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.420
 because we know how difficult it is 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.310
 huh 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.160
 and this is it today 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:27.320
 now in the year 2015 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.750
 I intend while in the triathlon to appear 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.740
 any opportunity for me to be 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.510
 entering the triathlon in the theater and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.330
 This year I'm more focused on theater. 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.560
 but still taking the tests of athletics 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.000
 for those who are looking for a 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.970
 rehabilitation 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.820
 I have no doubt that the sport is 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.780
 the best way no matter what the age 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.820
 or amputation or other disability that 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.310
 the person has I think she will 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.150
 find fine efforts and 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.340
 help her both physically and 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.530
 morally socially 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.530
 the sport helps in every way
