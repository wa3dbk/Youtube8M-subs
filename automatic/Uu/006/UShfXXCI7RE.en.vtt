00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 for decades man centuries ago 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.040
 fight against the same enemy time 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 that by passing quickly leaves footprints 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 cruel of our body if you are 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 woman will feel the weight of the years 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.680
 quickly on your face those wrinkles 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.320
 the furrows next to the mouth or the skin 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.810
 cracked dry and lumps ah and if it is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.140
 man maybe he is already suffering with those 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 empty spaces in your head and maybe 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.050
 you are already thinking that you have to shave 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.110
 what little he has left 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.530
 you've seen the pin just leave it 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.960
 long and curl exact and the pin 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.030
 to reach the ball was about to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.030
 do that until the plasma came to me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.970
 plasma has said Maurizio Fernandini and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.090
 what is that the new weapon of science 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.720
 against aging says live 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.000
 in our own blood I started to 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.730
 losing the hair considered that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.560
 prematurely at 25 years old 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.580
 promptly I had to live a situation 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.530
 of stress and I went to the doctor and he told me that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.620
 yes, I could be balding 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.070
 by stress but one way or another was 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.800
 irreversible and feeling young but 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.530
 have a notorious old age symptom 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.770
 as baldness always generates some 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.660
 emotional imbalance to me generated me 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 no no insecurity bone me I looked good 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.950
 I saw as well as I myself 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 I disapproved I spent a whole stage with 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.740
 thousands of hats of all colors 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.970
 It was like it was not easy 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 at the beginning exhibit your baldness 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.250
 in a few moments Mauritius more than being 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 a public journalist and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.430
 television host had many 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.159
 eyes on him in the same block 37 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.220
 until you'll see that in our work 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.979
 nothing is hidden clear and I exposed my 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.810
 baldness and I spent five years doing 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.300
 20 lucas and your day to completely 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.430
 bald and in the street they said to me speak 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.980
 peeled me they made my jokes allusive to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.830
 Pelada and I followed her 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.739
 we will enjoy two of these five 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.950
 exquisiteces heras and a perfect ball 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.019
 Billiards like that is well I tried 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.959
 obviously many treatments when 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.450
 come out 90 of all I submitted to a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.280
 painful hair transplant I just took 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.310
 pills I applied balms I put 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.640
 Aloe until you finally assume that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.519
 I am discharging and can be happy 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 and fully and there I went through the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.140
 lifetime 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.180
 showing me baldness and some dancing 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.760
 bald the bald champion I've passed 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.340
 happy moments of my life or a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.590
 plasma treatment at the beginning he 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.350
 denied he did not want to have false 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.300
 expectations in the case of Mauricio had 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.150
 what to do the application once a month 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.610
 and on three different occasions and in the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.709
 second month I started to see first that the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.260
 little hair that I had left was more 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.520
 thick and stronger already has the third 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.560
 new bulbs started to come out 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.020
 new horses new hair what 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.550
 yes it surprises me is the number of times 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.590
 that have stopped me on the street to 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.989
 ask me where have I done the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.300
 hair transplant that you've done that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.160
 my hairdresser has come so much hair 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.320
 people who know me or the housewives in the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.570
 market with whom he worked six 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.330
 years and have seen as that the mutation 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.000
 it tells me in this that you have done that I saw 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.340
 how good your hair looks now just 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.770
 it has to be done some more applications 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.920
 to reinforce the treatment every six 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.960
 months and then once a year I'm going to 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.450
 definitely be the sixth month 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.260
 and three more because I want to be firmly 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.050
 uncle things and kill all my complexes 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.660
 with an abundant mane that shakes 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.840
 for the markets of the city and because 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.600
 not because I do not use that science that both 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.330
 fight against time the implacable the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.120
 what happened because we do not laugh at the age 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.360
 stick out your tongue to old age and step 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.360
 get us a few years off
