00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.180
 very good friends in this opportunity 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.980
 I'll explain how to download those 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.980
 those applications that come out already 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.919
 Sometimes it is not in your store 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.059
 virtual the app store in this case I go 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.059
 to look for need for speed 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.669
 no limits, which had already been 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.740
 left but does not appear here does not come out 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.980
 that back then what we 're going to do 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.250
 is going to safari write tweet point 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.290
 tongue book dotcom depending on 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.170
 devices using them will come out 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.230
 the options in this case I get this 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.720
 blue rectangular button with the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.579
 Apple apple symbol 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 and let's give it there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.490
 to install we wait a moment and we 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 will appear this we give to install 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.000
 we go out with home button we hope that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.840
 is downloaded I'm going to eliminate it by 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 this they already see that I already have 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 and we enter will tell them if they want 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.670
 confirm or not 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.860
 now once inside we are going to wait for a 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.710
 moment some notifications that 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.430
 they're going to come out and we give it to ok done this 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.170
 let's look for the one that did not 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.950
 we were here and ready here 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.860
 we find need for speed no limit 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.660
 this form of these applications are the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.810
 typical Chinese applications those that 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.110
 You can download them 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.240
 literally illegal 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 while not violating any rule 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 I am presenting this not for the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.009
 fact that here you can also 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.750
 download paid applications I'm 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.090
 against piracy see my 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.149
 other videos in which I'm 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.640
 giving free alternatives 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.580
 payment applications 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.500
 in this case that this game is free 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.600
 and I'm official, I'm teaching 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.880
 to all there are not only these 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.340
 there are also games which have 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.940
 the symbol of the application which 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.959
 can see here they are not bad they are not 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.450
 so bad unfortunately as you will see 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.690
 are in Chinese some remains are 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.460
 find in Korean 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.230
 but I have to accept that they are very 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.110
 good here you can find different 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.240
 games that have not gone to for the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.860
 devices or the place where you 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.810
 find 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470
 but good 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.730
 that is the most important thing of all good 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.250
 thank you 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.640

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.640
