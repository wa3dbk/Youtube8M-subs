00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:51.750 

magnet<00:01:40.990> working<00:01:41.260> here<00:01:47.970> no<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.420> doesn't<00:01:50.760> say

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.750 

and<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.210> think<00:01:58.420> there's<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.659> corner

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
and I think there's a corner

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.969 
and I think there's a corner
but<00:02:01.270> there's<00:02:01.480> one<00:02:01.810> time

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.709

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
here but but these don't respawn at all

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.449 
here but but these don't respawn at all
so

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.420 

and<00:02:13.879> like<00:02:14.000> everything<00:02:14.239> else<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.659> this<00:02:14.720> level

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
