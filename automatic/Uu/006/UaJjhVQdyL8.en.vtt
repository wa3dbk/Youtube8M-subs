we switch to the secretary viewer we

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.020 
we switch to the secretary viewer we
cannot<00:01:12.460> see<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.760> sectors<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.189> how<00:01:18.670> can<00:01:18.909> we

cannot see you sectors so how can we

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.440 
cannot see you sectors so how can we
judge<00:01:19.330> if<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.049> firmware<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.860> logical<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.820> lot<00:01:22.000> or

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
judge if the firmware a logical a lot or

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.550 
judge if the firmware a logical a lot or
physical<00:01:23.259> problem<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.360> doing<00:01:25.960> we<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.439> do

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
physical problem we can doing we can do

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.490 
physical problem we can doing we can do
this<00:01:26.710> by<00:01:27.009> updating<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.729> firmware<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
this by updating the firmware if the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.090 
this by updating the firmware if the
firmware<00:01:29.740> could<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.759> updated<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.619> is<00:01:32.829> not

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
firmware could be updated then it is not

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.810 
firmware could be updated then it is not
a<00:01:33.130> physical<00:01:33.400> problem<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.860> logical<00:01:36.340> head<00:01:36.610> read

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
a physical problem the logical head read

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.060 
a physical problem the logical head read
only<00:01:36.970> problem<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:37.689> usually<00:01:38.350> caused<00:01:38.890> by

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
only problem is usually caused by

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.230 
only problem is usually caused by
corrupted<00:01:39.790> GD<00:01:40.119> store<00:01:40.509> smart<00:01:40.990> list<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:43.210> they

are corrupted the HDD will protect

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.380 
are corrupted the HDD will protect
itself<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:48.310> will<00:01:48.490> disable<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.149> right

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
now loop down the procedures now we can

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:04.460 
now loop down the procedures now we can
power<00:03:52.690> off<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.140> on<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:54.130> see<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:54.489> will<00:03:54.700> happen

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.370 

now<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.500> can<00:04:05.890> see<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.280> status<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:07.000> ready<00:04:07.480> and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
now you can see the status is ready and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.210 
now you can see the status is ready and
we<00:04:08.830> click<00:04:09.100> here

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.850 

you<00:04:15.880> can<00:04:16.060> see<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.600> parameters<00:04:17.019> are<00:04:17.530> showing

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
you can see the parameters are showing

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.790 
you can see the parameters are showing
and<00:04:19.560> we'll<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:20.980> check<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.489> sectors<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.410> now

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
and we'll now check the sectors and now

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.850 
and we'll now check the sectors and now
you<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:24.640> see<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> sectors<00:04:25.330> are<00:04:25.570> accessible

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.630 

we<00:04:29.860> can<00:04:30.010> try<00:04:30.130> different<00:04:30.280> sectors<00:04:32.460> okay<00:04:33.460> it's

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
we can try different sectors okay it's

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.860 
we can try different sectors okay it's
good<00:04:33.790> now<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.720> now<00:04:35.170> we<00:04:35.230> finish<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.680> case
