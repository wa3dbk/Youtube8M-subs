00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.010 
handling
equipment<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:10.360> my<00:02:10.479> own<00:02:10.630> personal

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
equipment that's just my own personal

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.550 
equipment that's just my own personal
preference<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.900> she's<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.110> slide<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
preference so she's going to slide the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.840 
preference so she's going to slide the
card<00:02:14.830> out<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.280> all<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.580> leave

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
card out and here is you all just leave

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.220 
card out and here is you all just leave
it<00:02:19.030> there<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.600> here<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:21.270> hour<00:02:22.270> 7<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
it there actually here is your hour 7 to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.170 
it there actually here is your hour 7 to
40<00:02:23.710> graphics<00:02:24.100> card<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.850> see<00:02:24.910> it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
40 graphics card so as you can see it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.410 
40 graphics card so as you can see it's
a<00:02:25.270> very<00:02:25.300> small<00:02:25.660> PCB<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.860> most<00:02:27.670> graphics<00:02:28.060> cards

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
a very small PCB and most graphics cards

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.240 
a very small PCB and most graphics cards
would<00:02:28.570> wear<00:02:29.050> my<00:02:29.170> top<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.620> hand<00:02:29.800> finger<00:02:30.130> is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
would wear my top right hand finger is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.330 
would wear my top right hand finger is
will<00:02:30.430> come<00:02:30.580> out<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.880> far<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:33.010> slim

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
will come out that far but very slim

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.460 
will come out that far but very slim
it's<00:02:33.490> only<00:02:33.610> what<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> single<00:02:34.270> slot<00:02:34.510> graphics

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
it's only what a single slot graphics

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.010 
it's only what a single slot graphics
card<00:02:35.710> as<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.070> see<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.900> do

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
card as you can see and what you can do

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.050 
card as you can see and what you can do
is<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.740> can<00:02:38.860> actually<00:02:38.950> unscrew<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.970> you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
is you can actually unscrew this and you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.980 
is you can actually unscrew this and you
can<00:02:40.240> then<00:02:40.870> readjust<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.540> output

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
can then readjust the the output

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.800 
can then readjust the the output
connectors<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.580> put<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.420> into<00:02:46.660> a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
connectors so you can put this into a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.460 
connectors so you can put this into a
even<00:02:47.560> thinner<00:02:47.860> PC<00:02:48.670> case<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.450> moment<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
even thinner PC case so at the moment is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.710 
even thinner PC case so at the moment is
quite<00:02:50.920> wide<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.400> bracket<00:02:51.850> but<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.390> use

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
quite wide that bracket but you can use

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.949 
quite wide that bracket but you can use
these<00:02:53.410> brackets<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:54.310> again<00:02:54.880> half<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.390> size<00:02:55.630> of

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
these brackets to again half the size of

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.470 
these brackets to again half the size of
the<00:02:56.080> graphics<00:02:56.470> card<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.890> wanted<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.490> but

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the graphics card if you wanted to but

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.810 
the graphics card if you wanted to but
I've<00:02:58.810> ways<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.320> see<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.740> M<00:03:00.010> there's<00:03:00.610> one

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
I've ways you can see it's M there's one

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.610 
I've ways you can see it's M there's one
very<00:03:01.060> small<00:03:01.360> fan<00:03:01.630> now<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:01.930> not<00:03:02.050> short<00:03:02.260> size

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
very small fan now I'm not short size

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.400 
very small fan now I'm not short size
that<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:04.540> really<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.930> nothing<00:03:05.110> to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
that is but there really is nothing to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.190 
that is but there really is nothing to
this<00:03:05.530> card<00:03:05.800> there's<00:03:05.980> no<00:03:06.130> additional<00:03:07.200> there's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
this card there's no additional there's

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.080 
this card there's no additional there's
no<00:03:08.350> additional<00:03:08.740> power<00:03:08.980> connectors<00:03:09.550> that's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
no additional power connectors that's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.210 
no additional power connectors that's
the<00:03:10.300> back<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> PCB<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.800> me<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.100> looks

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
the back of the PCB and to me that looks

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.770 
the back of the PCB and to me that looks
a<00:03:12.310> bit<00:03:12.340> wonky<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:14.650> out<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.890> box<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:16.209> VGA

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
a bit wonky right out the box this VGA

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.920 
a bit wonky right out the box this VGA
cable<00:03:17.260> here<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.620> looks<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:18.100> bit<00:03:18.930> maybe

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
cable here just looks a little bit maybe

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.570 
cable here just looks a little bit maybe
won't<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:20.769> how<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.100> fits<00:03:21.280> into

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
won't you have to see how it fits into

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.699 
won't you have to see how it fits into
the<00:03:21.700> PC<00:03:22.330> case<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.320> wanted<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.680> a

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
the PC case but if you wanted to have a

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.600 
the PC case but if you wanted to have a
look<00:03:23.800> at<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:23.980> connectors<00:03:24.430> you've<00:03:25.030> got<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.470> DVI

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
look at the connectors you've got a DVI

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.320 
look at the connectors you've got a DVI
HDMI<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.570> VGA<00:03:29.500> connector<00:03:30.430> as<00:03:30.670> well<00:03:30.730> so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
HDMI and a VGA connector as well so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330 
HDMI and a VGA connector as well so
that's<00:03:31.959> been<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> unboxing<00:03:32.560> video<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.310> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that's been the unboxing video and I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.690 
that's been the unboxing video and I
guess<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.550> first<00:03:33.970> look<00:03:34.209> at<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.600> XFX<00:03:35.230> r7<00:03:35.890> 240<00:03:36.310> as

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
guess a first look at the XFX r7 240 as

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.370 
guess a first look at the XFX r7 240 as
