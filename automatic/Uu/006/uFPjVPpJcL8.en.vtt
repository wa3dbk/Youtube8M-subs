relief on a guitar one without using a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
relief on a guitar one without using a
straightedge<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.309> use<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:42.000> repair

you<00:00:45.089> more<00:00:45.300> consistency<00:00:46.050> than<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.409> Iying

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you more consistency than the Iying

method the Iying method that i'm talking

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
method the Iying method that i'm talking
about<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.250> guitar<00:00:50.610> techs<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> you've

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
about is when guitar techs and you've

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
about is when guitar techs and you've
probably<00:00:51.329> seen<00:00:51.540> them<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:52.049> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
probably seen them do it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.280 
probably seen them do it
they'll<00:00:52.589> look<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> neck<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.140> if

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
they'll look down the neck to see if

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.009 
they'll look down the neck to see if
there's<00:00:55.530> proper<00:00:55.949> relief<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.879> they'll<00:00:57.780> also

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
there's proper relief or they'll also

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.590 
there's proper relief or they'll also
hold<00:00:58.860> down<00:00:58.979> the<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.489> fret<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.210> 12th

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
hold down the first fret and the 12th

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
hold down the first fret and the 12th
fret<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:00.989> they'll<00:01:01.500> tap<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.640> middle<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
fret and they'll tap at the middle of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
fret and they'll tap at the middle of
where<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.479> relief<00:01:03.780> should<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.920> how

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
where the relief should be to see how

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
where the relief should be to see how
much<00:01:05.309> play<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.149> string<00:01:06.570> between<00:01:06.929> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
much play is in the string between the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.499 
much play is in the string between the
fret<00:01:07.619> wire<00:01:07.649> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> string<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.300> if<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
fret wire and the string to see if you

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.809 
fret wire and the string to see if you
have<00:01:09.690> any<00:01:09.899> play<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.340> method<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
have any play at all the method that I

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.940 
have any play at all the method that I
like<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.179> use<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.990> feeler<00:01:13.319> gauge<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like to use is the feeler gauge the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
like to use is the feeler gauge the
feeler<00:01:14.190> gauge<00:01:14.429> is<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> great<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.300> keep

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
feeler gauge is a great way to keep

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
feeler gauge is a great way to keep
consistency<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.100> -<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.700> still

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
consistency there is - there's still

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
consistency there is - there's still
some<00:01:17.990> inconsistencies<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.470> using<00:01:20.039> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
some inconsistencies with using the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
some inconsistencies with using the
feeler<00:01:20.429> gauge<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> feeling

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
feeler gauge because it is a feeling

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
feeler gauge because it is a feeling
between<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.340> string<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.789> fret<00:01:24.000> wire

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
between the string and the fret wire

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
between the string and the fret wire
using<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.229> gauge<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.039> does<00:01:26.280> give<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
using the gauge but it does give you a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.749 
using the gauge but it does give you a
really<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.530> way<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> keep<00:01:29.069> a<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.460> better

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
really good way to keep a bit better

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.180 
really good way to keep a bit better
accuracy<00:01:30.539> without<00:01:31.110> having<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> use<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
accuracy without having to use a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.149 
accuracy without having to use a
straightedge<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.600> using<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> string<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
straightedge or using the string as a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
straightedge or using the string as a
straightedge<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.539> let<00:01:36.929> me<00:01:37.020> let<00:01:37.319> me

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
straightedge so let me let me

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.680 
straightedge so let me let me
demonstrate<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:38.129> I<00:01:38.280> start<00:01:38.700> by<00:01:39.000> taking<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
demonstrate here I start by taking a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.180 
demonstrate here I start by taking a
capo<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.879> I<00:01:41.879> capo<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.720> first<00:01:42.959> fret<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.500> what

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
capo and I capo the first fret and what

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.600 
capo and I capo the first fret and what
that<00:01:44.369> does<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.569> gets<00:01:46.440> rid<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.770> any<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.489> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that does is it gets rid of any of the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
that does is it gets rid of any of the
inconsistencies<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:49.050> nut<00:01:49.319> can<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:50.099> add

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
inconsistencies that the nut can can add

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.619 
inconsistencies that the nut can can add
to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.300> setup<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.860> secondly<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.629> make

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:54.629 
to the setup and then secondly I make

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.660 
to the setup and then secondly I make

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
by using the gauge is when you put it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.510 
by using the gauge is when you put it
under<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.990> string<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.500> you'll<00:02:44.250> either
