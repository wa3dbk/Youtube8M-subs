00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.010
 there are times when it is better 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 listen to this can slow down 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 slowly slowly 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 here who knows now how much it will cost us 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 this beautiful picture a lot of euros 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.590
 damn yet the tachometer ce 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.270
 all cars have it but not enough 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 careless carelessness for the rules 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.140
 of the road or presumption of no 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.360
 don't even want to look at the speedometer 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.500
 because we know so much by ourselves if we are 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.500
 going too strong 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.990
 maybe when we run on our legs 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 we can control ours 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.160
 speed and in any case it is unlikely that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.070
 we become dangerous for us and for the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.620
 others jogging in the car is a face 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.510
 different 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.980
 drive without adjusting with speedometer is 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.980
 a bit like doing it to people 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.950
 this is not a test of speed nor of 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.030
 cleverness 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.980
 it is simply a 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.690
 experiment to understand what would happen 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:15.970
 the day you were to find yourself with 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:18.070
 your speedometer broken first 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.240
 what we place on our sight a 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.420
 Speed â€‹â€‹Cameras 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.520
 exactly the same beloved 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.649
 tool is also up to you who will have done 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.649
 finally deceive the liver 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.649
 look your enemy in the face 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.539
 plus there is another tool the box that 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.759
 we apply to the car that shows 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.679
 the exact speed of the car but 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.229
 of course our driver does not 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.289
 will be able to read it thanks only to his 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.179
 intuition and his experience will have to each 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.549
 try to reach the exact time 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.259
 speed that we will indicate and each 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.369
 Once the speed camera tells us if it is there 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.200
 succeeded 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.830
 as you know it is a tool of one 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.780
 ruthless precision first round without al 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.810
 speedometer is to maintain a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.670
 speed of 90 km per hour 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 no, we are not too easy 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.369
 used to throw continuously 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.369
 the eye to the speedometer needle 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.739
 no we are not it is possible that it is enough 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.730
 so little to lose contact with 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.260
 reality 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.400
 let alone if we add some 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.950
 disturbing element 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 you like the music I always have 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.200
 having said that music is ideal for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.580
 focus on this time since 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.390
 we are on track and we can 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.040
 to allow 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.720
 we ask our driver to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 reach the speed of 120 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.470
 kilometers per hour and keep it for a 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:52.540
 we are not the music trouble 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.790
 at full volume he just confused the most 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.880
 driver moved him far away from the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.190
 speed just an interesting thing 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.810
 that we have detected and that often who 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.480
 driving tends to maintain speed 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.060
 lower than the one required in the test 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.519
 maybe it's the sign that when we can't 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.230
 count on our securities 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.790
 we all become more fearful 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.650
 better then be accompanied by one 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.190
 friendly voice with that will surely go 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.190
 better 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.849
 talking on the phone then even goes 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.709
 worse a part of the brain is 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.659
 engaged in the phone call and who leads 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.319
 an increasingly wrong perception 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.319
 of speed 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.159
 no way 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.510
 to be able to keep the eye so 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.269
 predetermined speed 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.590
 in short, it is not at all simple 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.129
 we have learned a new one 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.599
 lesson 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 should you break it 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.530
 speedometer better not to rely 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.430
 on your intuition but immediately run to 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.430
 get it repaired
