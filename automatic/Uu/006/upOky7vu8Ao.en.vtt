00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
one of them they were there just about

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
one of them they were there just about
two<00:02:11.550> weeks<00:02:11.730> after<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.300> started<00:02:12.750> MMA<00:02:13.110> training

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
two weeks after I started MMA training

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.600 
two weeks after I started MMA training
so<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.460> was<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> great<00:02:15.420> start<00:02:15.810> being<00:02:16.800> becoming

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so it was a great start being becoming

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
functional training you use stabilizers

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090 
functional training you use stabilizers
and<00:02:48.209> mobilizes<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.959> normally<00:02:49.320> never<00:02:49.500> use<00:02:49.890> if

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and mobilizes you normally never use if

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.060 
and mobilizes you normally never use if
you're<00:02:50.640> not<00:02:50.820> having<00:02:51.350> resistance<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.920> way

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
you're not having resistance in a way

thats troops gives you when you see the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.560 
thats troops gives you when you see the
workouts<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.830> we're<00:02:56.040> doing<00:02:56.820> with<00:02:57.030> with

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
workouts that we're doing with with

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.900 
workouts that we're doing with with
these<00:02:57.890> resistance<00:02:58.890> bands<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.580> see<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
these resistance bands you can see the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.729 
these resistance bands you can see the
intensity<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.600> intensity<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.320> out<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
intensity and the intensity is out of

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.430 
intensity and the intensity is out of
this<00:03:02.070> world<00:03:02.300> right<00:03:03.300> away<00:03:03.450> when<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.020> when<00:03:04.410> you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
this world right away when you when you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.470 
this world right away when you when you
use<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.980> product<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.430> find<00:03:05.850> your<00:03:06.030> weak<00:03:06.180> spots

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
use the product you find your weak spots

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.420 
use the product you find your weak spots
and<00:03:06.660> finding<00:03:06.989> your<00:03:07.110> weak<00:03:07.260> spots<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.010> first

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and finding your weak spots is the first

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.910 
and finding your weak spots is the first
step<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.880> improving<00:03:09.120> them<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.709> actually

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
step in improving them and you actually

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
step in improving them and you actually
normally<00:03:11.610> don't<00:03:12.120> even<00:03:12.420> realize<00:03:12.840> where<00:03:13.170> these

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
normally don't even realize where these

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.920 
normally don't even realize where these
weak<00:03:13.650> points<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.239> automatically<00:03:15.239> when<00:03:15.540> using

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
weak points are automatically when using

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.020 
weak points are automatically when using
the<00:03:16.320> resistance<00:03:16.920> from<00:03:17.130> multiple<00:03:17.550> angles<00:03:17.730> on

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the resistance from multiple angles on

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.150 
the resistance from multiple angles on
your<00:03:18.180> body<00:03:18.390> your<00:03:18.810> body<00:03:19.020> starts<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> adjust<00:03:19.980> and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
your body your body starts to adjust and

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640 
your body your body starts to adjust and
unite<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.600> help<00:03:21.810> from<00:03:21.989> from<00:03:22.230> day<00:03:22.410> one

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
unite so it was help from from day one

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.960 
unite so it was help from from day one
and<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.250> getting<00:03:23.520> better<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.850> better

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and it's just getting better and better

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.229 
and it's just getting better and better
I<00:03:24.680> think<00:03:25.680> Stroup's<00:03:26.220> has<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.640> potential<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
I think Stroup's has the potential to

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.960 
I think Stroup's has the potential to
change<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> whole<00:03:28.590> world<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:29.010> fitness<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
