it up and reapplying it not all the way
but<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.550> at<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.850> corners<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.600> getting

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
but like at the corners and just getting

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.690 
but like at the corners and just getting
out<00:02:52.930> dust<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.410> had<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> few<00:02:53.860> bubble<00:02:54.220> marks<00:02:54.550> or

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
out dust I had a few bubble marks or

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
out dust I had a few bubble marks or
adhesive<00:02:55.120> marks<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> didn't<00:02:55.750> set<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.140> just

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
adhesive marks it didn't set I just

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.650 
adhesive marks it didn't set I just
gently<00:02:56.950> lifted<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.520> up<00:02:57.610> very<00:02:57.850> carefully<00:02:58.180> and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
gently lifted it up very carefully and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.880 
gently lifted it up very carefully and
then<00:02:58.720> laid<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.080> back<00:02:59.110> down<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.620> they<00:02:59.710> went

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
then laid it back down and they went

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.950 
then laid it back down and they went
away<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.090> now<00:03:01.240> it's<00:03:01.390> perfect

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
away and you can see now it's perfect

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.170 
away and you can see now it's perfect
just<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.410> glass<00:03:02.740> and<00:03:03.100> you're<00:03:03.880> not<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.090> to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
just like glass and you're not going to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.150 
just like glass and you're not going to
want<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.690> lot<00:03:05.020> because<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.950> will

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
want to do that a lot because it will

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.940 
want to do that a lot because it will
lessen<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.180> power<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.720> adhesive<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.860> you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
lessen the power of the adhesive but you

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.440 
lessen the power of the adhesive but you
can<00:03:09.160> do<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.460> like<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.640> little<00:03:09.940> bit<00:03:10.060> right<00:03:10.180> away

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
can do it like a little bit right away

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.690 
can do it like a little bit right away
now<00:03:10.990> this<00:03:11.290> one<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.920> clear<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.400> it's<00:03:12.550> going

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
now this one is the clear so it's going
