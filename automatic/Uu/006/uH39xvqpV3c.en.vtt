is the TQ 2.4 gigahertz system let me
open<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.320> up

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

it
double-a<00:02:12.060> batteries<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.220> put<00:02:14.370> some

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
double-a batteries so I have to put some

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.280 
double-a batteries so I have to put some
in<00:02:14.670> there<00:02:14.790> because<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.780> doesn't<00:02:16.049> come<00:02:16.170> with
