00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
University of Arizona our idea of the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.460 
University of Arizona our idea of the
poll<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.900> we're<00:00:39.050> going<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:39.260> have<00:00:39.410> a

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
poll this is we're going to have a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.120 
poll this is we're going to have a
rocket<00:00:40.040> going<00:00:40.340> over<00:00:41.800> gigantic<00:00:42.800> structures

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
rocket going over gigantic structures

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.990 
rocket going over gigantic structures
we're<00:00:43.220> building<00:00:43.490> right<00:00:43.580> now<00:00:43.730> which<00:00:43.880> is

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
we're building right now which is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.120 
we're building right now which is
essentially<00:00:44.420> our<00:00:44.540> entire<00:00:44.810> fort<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:45.890> we<00:00:46.010> have

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
essentially our entire fort so we have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.010 
essentially our entire fort so we have
like<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.340> float<00:00:46.610> committee<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.450> that's

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
like a float committee and that's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.840 
like a float committee and that's
comprised<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:48.890> bunch<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.490> members<00:00:49.700> that

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
comprised of a bunch of members that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.560 
comprised of a bunch of members that
it's<00:00:50.120> got<00:00:50.270> three<00:00:50.540> basic<00:00:51.200> heads<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:58.570> it's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
it's got three basic heads to it it's

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.150 
it's got three basic heads to it it's
really<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.900> all<00:01:00.020> about<00:01:00.260> communication<00:01:00.890> and

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
really just all about communication and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.030 
really just all about communication and
seeing<00:01:01.820> what<00:01:02.030> other<00:01:02.240> people<00:01:02.920> what<00:01:03.920> their

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
seeing what other people what their

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.859 
seeing what other people what their
ideas<00:01:04.339> are<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.790> being<00:01:05.150> open-minded<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.840> new

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
ideas are and being open-minded to new

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.390 
ideas are and being open-minded to new
ideas<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.500> if<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.650> can<00:01:06.770> snowball<00:01:07.040> with<00:01:07.369> a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
ideas and see if you can snowball with a

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.730 
ideas and see if you can snowball with a
simple<00:01:07.729> idea<00:01:07.840> because<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.049> really<00:01:09.290> hard

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
simple idea because it's really hard

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.560 
simple idea because it's really hard
sometimes<00:01:09.859> to<00:01:10.520> come<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.149> with<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.299> good<00:01:11.479> idea

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
sometimes to come up with a good idea

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.669 
sometimes to come up with a good idea
and<00:01:11.810> something<00:01:12.079> that<00:01:12.170> we<00:01:12.289> haven't<00:01:12.560> already

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
and something that we haven't already

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.830 
and something that we haven't already
done<00:01:13.070> in<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.219> past<00:01:13.479> well<00:01:14.479> we<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
done in the past well we have a

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
taking pride and the construction of our

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.149 
taking pride and the construction of our
floats<00:01:19.670> we've<00:01:19.909> won<00:01:20.090> for<00:01:20.299> several<00:01:20.689> years<00:01:21.159> but

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
floats we've won for several years but

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.559 
floats we've won for several years but
it's<00:01:22.399> not<00:01:22.549> only<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.819> you<00:01:23.179> know<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:23.420> see

ourselves<00:01:23.659> as<00:01:24.109> engineers<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.979> part<00:01:25.219> of<00:01:25.280> that

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
ourselves as engineers and part of that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.149 
ourselves as engineers and part of that
is<00:01:25.579> doing<00:01:26.359> what<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.689> can<00:01:26.719> and<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:28.039> know

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
campus we've really been pushing more

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.700 
campus we've really been pushing more
recently<00:01:39.909> for<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.329> but<00:01:41.079> this<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.439> what<00:01:41.560> people

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
always walk they go oh there's the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.179 
always walk they go oh there's the
engineer<00:01:44.200> float<00:01:44.409> they're<00:01:44.619> gonna<00:01:44.710> win<00:01:44.950> again

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
engineer float they're gonna win again

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.700 
engineer float they're gonna win again
or<00:01:45.579> it's<00:01:46.030> those<00:01:46.179> engineers<00:01:46.719> and<00:01:47.409> they'll<00:01:47.560> see

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
or it's those engineers and they'll see

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.889 
or it's those engineers and they'll see
a<00:01:47.740> gigantic<00:01:48.159> float<00:01:48.490> some<00:01:48.820> cannibal<00:01:49.360> aspect<00:01:49.750> to

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
a gigantic float some cannibal aspect to

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:50.940 
a gigantic float some cannibal aspect to
it<00:01:49.929> that's<00:01:50.200> just<00:01:50.439> ridiculous

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
it that's just ridiculous

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.029 
it that's just ridiculous
and<00:01:51.700> that's<00:01:51.850> like<00:01:52.750> why<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.110> do<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.380> it's

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
and that's like why we do it is it's

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.090 
and that's like why we do it is it's
just<00:01:54.369> for<00:01:54.549> fun<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.850> fries
