have them really don't they really have
hypertrophic<00:00:20.880> scars<00:00:21.180> which<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.900> much<00:00:22.080> easier

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
hypertrophic scars which are much easier

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.760 
hypertrophic scars which are much easier
to<00:00:22.710> treat<00:00:23.099> let<00:00:24.029> me<00:00:24.119> explain<00:00:24.509> if<00:00:25.349> you<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.650> an

to treat let me explain if you have an

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.100 
to treat let me explain if you have an
injury<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.250> even<00:00:26.579> a<00:00:26.970> surgical<00:00:27.300> procedure<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
injury or even a surgical procedure that

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.979 
injury or even a surgical procedure that
creates<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.739> cut<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.340> repaired<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
creates a cut that's repaired in the

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.590 
creates a cut that's repaired in the
shape<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.579> that<00:00:32.579> line<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
shape of that line and you get a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.410 
shape of that line and you get a
hypertrophic<00:00:34.380> scar<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.520> hypertrophic<00:00:36.060> scar

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
hypertrophic scar the hypertrophic scar

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.870 
hypertrophic scar the hypertrophic scar
is<00:00:36.710> approximately<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> size<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
is approximately the size or the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.640 
is approximately the size or the
footprint<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> original<00:00:39.899> injury<00:00:40.140> it's

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
footprint of the original injury it's

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.830 
footprint of the original injury it's
raised<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.790> generally<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> area<00:00:42.720> of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
raised but it's generally the area of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
raised but it's generally the area of
the<00:00:42.930> injury<00:00:43.130> if<00:00:44.130> you<00:00:44.310> get<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.490> keloid<00:00:45.060> in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the injury if you get a keloid in

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
the injury if you get a keloid in
response<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> injury<00:00:46.380> it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.220> only

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
response to that injury it's not only

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
response to that injury it's not only
raised<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.720> relationship<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
raised but it has no relationship to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.190 
raised but it has no relationship to
that<00:00:49.740> line<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> starts<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.150> grow<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.870> almost

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
that line so it starts to grow it almost

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.140 
that line so it starts to grow it almost
looks<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> cauliflower<00:00:53.160> type<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> shape

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
looks like a cauliflower type of shape

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.060 
looks like a cauliflower type of shape
it<00:00:54.390> almost<00:00:55.140> acts<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.800> independent

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it almost acts like an independent

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.990 
it almost acts like an independent
autonomous<00:00:56.850> tumor<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.960> grows<00:00:58.200> in<00:00:59.000> another

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
autonomous tumor that grows in another

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
autonomous tumor that grows in another
episode<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.750> discussed<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.590> treatment<00:01:01.950> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
episode I discussed the treatment of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.729 
episode I discussed the treatment of
raised<00:01:02.250> hypertrophic<00:01:02.970> scars<00:01:03.739> unfortunately

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
raised hypertrophic scars unfortunately

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
raised hypertrophic scars unfortunately
those<00:01:05.309> treatments<00:01:05.790> usually<00:01:06.329> do<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.990> work<00:01:07.170> for

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
those treatments usually do not work for

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.580 
those treatments usually do not work for
the<00:01:07.500> treatment<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> keloid<00:01:08.790> scars<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the treatment of keloid scars so just

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
the treatment of keloid scars so just
rubbing<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.579> keloid<00:01:11.970> scar<00:01:12.359> with<00:01:12.569> firm

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
rubbing the keloid scar with firm

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
rubbing the keloid scar with firm
pressure<00:01:13.039> doesn't<00:01:14.039> make<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.429> better

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
pressure doesn't make it better

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.169 
pressure doesn't make it better

help keloid scars the best way to treat
keloid<00:01:24.479> scars<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.560> injections<00:01:26.219> of

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
keloid scars is with injections of

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.120 
keloid scars is with injections of
concentrated<00:01:27.479> cortisone<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
concentrated cortisone right into the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
concentrated cortisone right into the
scar<00:01:29.399> they're<00:01:30.210> repeated<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> two<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> three

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
scar they're repeated a two to three

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
scar they're repeated a two to three
week<00:01:31.409> intervals<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.549> cause<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> scar<00:01:33.179> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
week intervals they cause the scar to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300 
week intervals they cause the scar to
become<00:01:33.539> softer<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.139> they<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> softer<00:01:34.859> they

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
become softer when they get softer they

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.919 
become softer when they get softer they
absorb<00:01:35.639> more<00:01:35.999> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> cortisone<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
absorb more of the cortisone and the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.770 
absorb more of the cortisone and the
cortisone<00:01:37.409> melts<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.369> extra<00:01:38.789> collagen<00:01:39.359> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
cortisone melts the extra collagen the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.959 
cortisone melts the extra collagen the
fibrous<00:01:40.229> tissue<00:01:40.469> in<00:01:40.709> the<00:01:40.829> scar<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> reduces

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
fibrous tissue in the scar and reduces

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.749 
fibrous tissue in the scar and reduces
its<00:01:42.149> size<00:01:42.359> if<00:01:42.719> that<00:01:43.469> doesn't<00:01:43.799> work<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.639> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
its size if that doesn't work then the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
its size if that doesn't work then the
only<00:01:44.909> other<00:01:45.119> option<00:01:45.209> is<00:01:45.659> having<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:46.560> keloid

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
only other option is having the keloid

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.879 
only other option is having the keloid
scar<00:01:47.280> surgically<00:01:47.939> excised<00:01:48.560> but<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
scar surgically excised but when you

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.739 
scar surgically excised but when you
surgically<00:01:50.340> excise<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.969> you<00:01:51.119> create<00:01:51.479> another

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
surgically excise it you create another

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.629 
surgically excise it you create another
injury<00:01:52.139> and<00:01:52.380> people<00:01:52.920> prone<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.429> forming

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
injury and people prone to forming

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.699 
injury and people prone to forming
keloids<00:01:54.209> form<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> response<00:01:55.469> to<00:01:55.679> all

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
keloids form the response to all

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.309 
keloids form the response to all
injuries<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.819> we're<00:01:57.149> always<00:01:57.270> concerned<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
injuries so we're always concerned that

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.440 
injuries so we're always concerned that
removing<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.039> keloid<00:01:59.369> surgically<00:01:59.880> will

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
removing the keloid surgically will

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.469
