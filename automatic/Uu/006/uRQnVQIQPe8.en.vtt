using<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.709> end<00:02:34.920> straight<00:02:35.489> from<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> reel

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
using the end straight from the reel

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000 
using the end straight from the reel
thread<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> braid<00:02:36.989> through<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.530> insulator

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
thread the braid through the insulator

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.880 
thread the braid through the insulator
and<00:02:38.250> clamp<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.850> tight<00:02:39.380> leave<00:02:40.380> approximately

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and clamp it tight leave approximately

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.160 
and clamp it tight leave approximately
