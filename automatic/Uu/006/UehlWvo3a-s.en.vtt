00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.660
 two years have passed since Marius insists a triumphant return that will 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.220
 catapulted to the highest 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 that literally came the stars with super galaxy galaxy 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.979
 now the nintendo plumber repeats formula but not repetitively with 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.080
 a kind of version 1 points 5 of its predecessor 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.740
 has been with many novelties that make the game a pretty title 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.270
 differentiated with the previous 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.800
 as miyamoto pretended from the beginning 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.970
 we will find a simple and very direct story 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.469
 until you get to the castle the princess shots started with the cake 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.120
 we will find a gigantic mouse covered with the power of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.270
 superstars this kidnaps the princess to take her to the center of the 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.220
 universe 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.870
 and create from there your galactic empire 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.130
 as soon as we regain control of May 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.180
 We are thrown to the first level of the game without any more dry at all if not 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 direct game 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.940
 since we do not have a great ship like in the first game from which to access 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.119
 the levels going through the rooms looking around for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.830
 find the following levels 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.200
 but we have a map of worlds in the purest style or a super mario bros 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 wii with which to find new crisis galaxies 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 by collecting enough stars in the first galaxies we will gain access 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 to the deepest part of each world to be able to overcome it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.060
 to preserve the same style of play to life as its predecessor with the wide 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.760
 variety of jumps that had the turn that we can make by shaking the command 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.010
 days ago the plague that point to the screen 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.040
 and the return of old powers like mac 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.070
 the fire nokia bees mary ghosts and marie spring 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.410
 whose appearances of the last two are very anecdotal 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.569
 but if they finish the elements that have followed in this new delivery 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.360
 leaving free passage to the novelties of games 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.069
 the most remarkable of the excessive waist as an adventurous companion 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.209
 I can be considered one of the two powers of May 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.469
 and here it appears only in those missions that can only be overcome 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.839
 with the 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.369
 You can use your kicking to stay a moment in the air eat at 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.789
 enemies or their feet against each other 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:24.479
 does acrobatics with the tongue in some elements and the main thing to eat some 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.749
 fruits that give you special abilities like running at full speed 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.969
 with the red fruit 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.159
 fly a few seconds with blue ribbon 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 today illuminates invisible roads with the yellow fleet 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.689
 next to them and new powers have been added for mario that will be of the 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.309
 most used in the adventure 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.699
 how are you Maria Lopez 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.099
 with which we can walk on fragile mondays jump higher 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.949
 extend slowly and create mario red time limited cloud platforms with 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.909
 the one that we become a big demolition bag that wipes out 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:54.619
 all 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.619
 barked slope with which to traverse the credible plans from side to side 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.359
 Finally, after a certain moment of departure 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.829
 we can play with luigi whenever we want having this his own 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.549
 characteristics of movement and jumping 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.810
 most levels are more loyal and focused on that line of 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.589
 jump on the agenda are the powers of it 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.709
 although at certain levels we must meet other requirements such as 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 Meniscus score to get the stars 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.709
 rolando in some races 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.849
 most of the levels are designed in such a way that the enemies 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.499
 are not the only danger despite how well placed they are in the levels if 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.109
 what the high adjusted platforms of the levels will do 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.779
 sweat the fat drop 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.229
 the final enemies of some phases are now more complicated 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 and we need to be stopped again 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.419
 if we complete a very fast level 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.419
 we will open a ghost of the programmers with which to try 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.369
 compete to improve our work 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:03.079
 the difficulty has increased but if we lose several pairs of times in the 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.049
 same level 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.579
 a silk spectrum will appear to help us pass the level 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.830
 if we accept 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.069
 the star we will get was bronze and not gold like the originals 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.729
 although it will be counted equally 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:20.269
 at the graphic level we find the same game engine adding new 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.710
 environments for the scenarios most of them new and full of 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.719
 charisma including indeed 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.999
 some important kids from other games of the franchise 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.210
 technically it remains outstanding without too many surprises and 

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:34.629
 without any technical failure 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.210
 maintaining fluidity at all times and even show more detail in 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:41.490
 the designs of enemies and characters 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.580
 it surprises again the design of galaxies where they have hardly been recycled 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.719
 of the first game 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.139
 and everything to the new situations including original final bosses 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.629
 the soundtrack is again in charge of the baton of the session and the silver 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.969
 played by a symphony orchestra on most of the pieces again 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.069
 Music is an important aspect Mario Galaxy 2 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.499
 giving personality to the levels and providing feelings of nostalgia 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.070
 joy 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.360
 and even and pool to the different situations of the game regarding the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.180
 cycle length we must say that he is not satisfied in a magnificent way 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.960
 since apart from the initial 120 stars with which the title counts 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.100
 we find 120 green stars that are activated when we have found 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.860
 all the originals 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.260
 and that are hidden during the course of the levels the place is in 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.069
 appearance 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.509
 they are inaccessible 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.330
 and that make us think more than with the first 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
 undoubtedly extending much more articles 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:56.629
 Mario returned to surprise us 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.529
 and this is the biggest surprise of the fire if you wanted to have seen it all in the first 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:01.029
 game 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.589
 you will again enjoy the infinite creativity and originality of nintendo 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:05.919
 in the design of levels 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.750
 to smile with retro details more alive than ever 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.650
 and has defended by the mechanical victim of the game during the hours of strike 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.399
 the second installment has enough changes and enough 

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.989
 new developments to affect both veteran and new players 

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:23.930
 players will find all the help needed in the game 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.150
 and on the DVD included with the same 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
 all this to enjoy the best platform title 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.770
 Guadalajara May 6 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.770
