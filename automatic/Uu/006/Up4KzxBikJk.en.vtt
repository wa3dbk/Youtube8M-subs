00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 I'm three and I want to bring you one. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 totally different thing that is the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.590
 Next guys today I was looking. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 here are community videos and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 I came across a very interesting video 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 that these here in fact all 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 videos you have here are really cool 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 I recommend you take a look and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 worth 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.720
 but look how interesting that here it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 at super ultra mega park the guy 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.989
 started winning this ramp with double 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 front flip 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.629
 he put on a cap and threw himself 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 skateboard looks what epic he did 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 that guy's name ecobuild them very good 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.780
 this video of 2010 a very old video 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 already but I found much of the time and I decided 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 to do something good was not on the ultra 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.820
 mega part there not to be so similar 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.579
 I decided to take this ramp that gives 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.170
 lewis and I rode a path that these 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.149
 here o 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.150
 for him to start again that he was 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.970
 no speed let's go there 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.689
 in fact it was not as epic as the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.310
 his 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.390
 he threw himself and such a skateboard that is the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.590
 Right, but it looks pretty cool. 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.030
 taking into account that it was the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.229
 first attempt I is also right and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 it worked out 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.350
 if you have enjoyed my vision is that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 Can people think of something like this? 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.159
 but then beauty then happening 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 Just to show the way, I'm not going. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.390
 do it now even because it has already dismantled 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.520
 what I had done there but it's in that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 local jumping here and there is more this ramp 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 made 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.149

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.490

 Come on, I'll tell you a little about it. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.079
 respect the maneuvers I started 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.840
 the front flip following the ramp with the 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:22.019
 new take off really cool hang out 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.230
 this step and the ramp was already very 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.989
 speed and goes to the main ramp 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.970
 I can do this maneuver method 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.730
 It's a pretty good maneuver. I like it a lot. 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.769
 and it is very speedy to achieve 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.420
 get there and just look at us and pick it up 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.189
 I thought it was cool to do this guys. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.129
