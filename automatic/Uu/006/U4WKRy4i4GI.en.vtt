00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:10.250
 Hello, I want to present to your 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.009
 attention to the next cooking recipe 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.539
 nozzles from semolina 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:19.250
 in the end we get something 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.820
 like boilies 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.170
 from semolina the process itself is simple 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 but ultimately takes quite 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:36.620
 plenty of time and so in boiling water water 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.120
 I have a little bit 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:47.930
 at this stage we need to achieve 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:53.300
 cook a cool semolina porridge and so in 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.250
 boiling water we fall asleep semolina necessary 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.870
 us quantity 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.620
 don't forget it all the time 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:08.719
 stir so as not to burn like water 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:11.049
 I expressed all this interfere with cooking very 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.049
 long 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.789
 literally a minute the door here is already 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.749
 principle and roller nothing so here 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:30.490
 turned out so turn off the stove now then 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:38.479
 what we got we cover 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:48.499
 lid and leave more to it at 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:56.590
 steamed and for one of the links and so porridge 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:02:01.670
 it's cool with us 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.299
 cool our dough don't even know how well 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.770
 now called 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.770
 it need a little bruise 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.580
 crushed now we pinch off little by little 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.590
 and sculpt here are such balls balls 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.640
 can sculpt 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.610
 completely different size which you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.620
 more like 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.730
 big small again depending 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.230
 on the size of the fish you are going to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:48.220
 catch blinded balls now take 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:51.049
 a needle and a thread on me is red well, I think 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.280
 the color of the thread does not matter 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.180
 although a friend who told me about 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.269
 this recipe 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.459
 claimed to take exactly the red 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.959
 thread but I did not argue it was the red 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.120
 red he said it was like 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:15.350
 more attracted by the fish well, let it be 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 red and string these balls on it 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.739
 cove 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.409
 on not calling them you need some on 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:35.959
 some distance from each other why 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:41.239
 I will explain later I don’t remember 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.670
 or not about flavors if 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.099
 decide to add some 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.650
 flavors 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.519
 this must be done immediately before 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.299
 the way you cook porridge that is water 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.700
 which you boil immediately add 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.709
 flavors 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.190
 let's say the same vanilla sugar or 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:09.170
 some weed or something else than 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.849
 you use and already pour water in porridge 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.730
 with these 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:20.180
 flavors are still very interesting 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:24.580
 food coloring gives results 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.889
 that is, before cooking porridge added water 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.039
 some dye don't know what 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.460
 colors colors are perfect 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:38.810
 diverse and in some cases it 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:45.280
 also helps to somehow activate the bite 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:50.780
 fish so there is a very large field for 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.130
 various experiments you can make 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.990
 myself such boilie 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:01.849
 with different flavors of different colors 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:07.240
 they are stored for a long time so well we did 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.979
 such a garland and now she needs 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.960
 dried up 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.990
 if it’s just going to dry it will take 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.669
 a couple of days I said they started it 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.790
 the process is not fast but you can process 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:27.190
 speed up 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:30.690
 dry these boilies in the oven when 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.500
 small temperature of 70 degrees 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:41.710
 it will be enough and they are dry enough 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:45.700
 quickly and so dry our warriors from semolina 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:53.380
 dried I sped up the process was drying in 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:55.650
 oven at low temperature 60 70 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.600
 degrees no longer need temperature 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:04.540
 temperature paste they just have you 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:08.800
 bake it is not necessary now cut 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.380
 them in the middle here are the strings I already 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.900
 He said that it is necessary to leave some 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:25.660
 the distance between the baits was cut and 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:35.070
 now connect the two ends of the thread between 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:35.070
 a normal knot we cut off the excess and 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.620
 it turns out such here 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:47.470
 Boyle as he sits down now show 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.010
 tout charge is very easy for you 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.010
 thread 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:01.770
 and all principle here in this form he 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.460
 casting a water it behaves 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:10.220
 does not blur does not dissolve remains 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.770
 In general, it is possible to prepare such boyle 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.330
 different with different flavors 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:20.190
 different color as needed 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.800
 gradually spend them take with you on 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.500
 fishing I tried to catch them 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.490
 several times the fishing has been successful so 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:33.450
 try it and you won't regret it 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:37.790
 the main thing here is what you can do 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:41.030
 you need and the size is what you need 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.070
 big small medium 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:48.030
 Well, I hope this video was something to you 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.950
 useful, interesting if you liked
