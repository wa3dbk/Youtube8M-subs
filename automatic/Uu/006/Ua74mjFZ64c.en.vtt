00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
just underneath the crease I'm not going

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.930 
just underneath the crease I'm not going
into<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.380> crease<00:03:37.620> because<00:03:37.829> as<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.609> take<00:03:38.790> our

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
into the crease because as we take our

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.339 
into the crease because as we take our
blending<00:03:39.299> brush<00:03:39.510> we're<00:03:39.989> going<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.200> be

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
blending brush we're going to be

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.289 
blending brush we're going to be
blending<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.889> choppy<00:03:41.400> line<00:03:41.700> as<00:03:41.880> well<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.269> we

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
blending that choppy line as well and we

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.819 
blending that choppy line as well and we
don't<00:03:42.480> want<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.690> color<00:03:42.989> up<00:03:43.319> too<00:03:43.620> high

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
don't want that color up too high

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.009 
don't want that color up too high
because<00:03:44.459> then<00:03:44.849> it's<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.810> way

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
because then it's just going to be way

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.330 
because then it's just going to be way
too<00:03:46.079> shimmery<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.859> crease<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.640 
too shimmery in the crease and I
personally<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.389> mats<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.989> my<00:03:49.139> crease<00:03:49.440> if

if<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.860> guys<00:04:08.010> would<00:04:08.250> call<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.760> cut<00:04:09.120> crease

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
if you guys would call this a cut crease

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.420 
if you guys would call this a cut crease
it's<00:04:09.570> not<00:04:09.750> super<00:04:10.290> defined<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.980> do<00:04:11.070> like<00:04:11.370> to

define<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.480> little<00:04:12.930> bit<00:04:13.140> more<00:04:13.380> than<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.770> is

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
define it a little bit more than it is

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
up that color in the crease now I'm

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.600 
up that color in the crease now I'm
going<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.080> using<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.440> NYC<00:04:22.980> liquid<00:04:23.370> liner

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
going to be using the NYC liquid liner

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.600 
going to be using the NYC liquid liner
to<00:04:24.270> create<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.260> wing<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.830> little<00:04:26.100> more<00:04:26.340> dramatic

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
to create a wing a little more dramatic

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.460 
to create a wing a little more dramatic
i'm<00:04:27.150> going<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> drag<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.690> out<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.960> little<00:04:28.290> bit

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
i'm going to drag it out a little bit

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.620 
i'm going to drag it out a little bit
more<00:04:28.650> than<00:04:28.710> usual<00:04:28.980> i<00:04:29.430> like<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.030> start<00:04:30.330> on<00:04:30.480> the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
more than usual i like to start on the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.930 
more than usual i like to start on the
lid<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:31.320> just<00:04:31.560> create<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.250> line<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.790> it's

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
lid then just create the line and it's

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.880 
lid then just create the line and it's
so<00:04:33.240> easy<00:04:33.510> when<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.870> have<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.290> tape<00:04:34.620> it's

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
so easy when you have this tape it's

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.970 
so easy when you have this tape it's
pretty<00:04:35.340> much<00:04:35.520> foolproof<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.990> right<00:04:37.500> after<00:04:37.710> I

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
pretty much foolproof so right after I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.700 
pretty much foolproof so right after I
do<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.310> liner<00:04:38.550> I'm<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.410> deepening<00:04:40.410> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
do the liner I'm just deepening and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.250 
do the liner I'm just deepening and
darkening<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.820> cocoa<00:04:42.210> bear<00:04:42.450> color<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
darkening that cocoa bear color in the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260 
darkening that cocoa bear color in the
outer<00:04:43.410> corner<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.010> actually<00:04:44.190> just<00:04:44.760> added<00:04:45.180> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
outer corner I actually just added a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.510 
outer corner I actually just added a
little<00:04:45.540> bit<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.810> black<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.100> then

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
little bit of black on to this and then

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
too dark for my face I'm obviously in a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.580 
too dark for my face I'm obviously in a
different<00:05:09.300> area<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> lighting<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
different area so the lighting is a

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.050 
different area so the lighting is a
little<00:05:10.860> bit<00:05:10.980> different<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.430> need<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.730> work<00:05:11.910> on

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
little bit different I need to work on

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.940 
little bit different I need to work on
that<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.450> that's<00:05:12.630> okay<00:05:12.930> everything<00:05:13.740> matched

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
that but that's okay everything matched

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.220 
that but that's okay everything matched
because<00:05:14.250> I'm<00:05:14.550> going<00:05:14.940> in<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.420> highlighting

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
because I'm going in and highlighting

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.260 
because I'm going in and highlighting
with<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.470> Mac<00:05:16.650> prep<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:17.160> prime<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.760> radiant

with the Mac prep and prime in radiant
rose<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:18.480> then<00:05:18.840> was<00:05:18.960> my<00:05:19.110> NYX<00:05:19.410> HD<00:05:19.590> concealer<00:05:20.550> so

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
rose and then was my NYX HD concealer so

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.000 
rose and then was my NYX HD concealer so
that's<00:05:21.210> really<00:05:21.510> kind<00:05:21.720> of<00:05:21.810> kind<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:22.110> balanced

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
that's really kind of kind of balanced

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.310 
that's really kind of kind of balanced
the<00:05:23.190> darkness<00:05:23.760> of<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.030> foundation<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:24.900> I'm

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
the darkness of the foundation and I'm

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.900 
the darkness of the foundation and I'm
not<00:05:25.440> going<00:05:25.770> anywhere<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:26.340> was<00:05:26.460> late<00:05:26.640> at<00:05:26.760> night

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
not going anywhere it was late at night

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.850 
not going anywhere it was late at night
so<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.480> really<00:05:28.140> didn't<00:05:28.320> have<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.500> worry<00:05:28.680> about

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
so I really didn't have to worry about

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.220
