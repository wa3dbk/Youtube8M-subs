00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
then outside of the Sun that are

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.630 
then outside of the Sun that are
identical<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.690> massive<00:02:06.370> what<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.490> hell

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640

let me guess NASA there are three

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.410 
let me guess NASA there are three
identical<00:02:15.260> asteroids<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.880> popped<00:02:17.180> up

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
identical asteroids that just popped up

right my ass you're looking at
spacecraft<00:02:24.320> that's<00:02:24.500> massive<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:27.320> I'm<00:02:27.380> gonna

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
spacecraft that's massive and I'm gonna

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.490 
spacecraft that's massive and I'm gonna

what you're looking at is a massive
object<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.490> is<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.760> massive<00:03:02.540> object<00:03:03.370> feeding

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
object it is a massive object feeding

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.220 
object it is a massive object feeding
off<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:06.050> Sun<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.940> heard<00:03:08.120> me<00:03:08.330> right<00:03:08.540> it's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
off of the Sun you heard me right it's

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.830 
off of the Sun you heard me right it's
feeding<00:03:09.620> off<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.250> Sun<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.910> you're<00:03:11.750> gonna

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
feeding off of the Sun and you're gonna

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.750 
feeding off of the Sun and you're gonna
see<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.320> energy<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.160> like<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.459> tether

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
see this energy it's like a tether

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.000 
see this energy it's like a tether
connected<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.080> here<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.739> pulls

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
connected to it right here as it pulls

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.550 
connected to it right here as it pulls
away<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.670> snaps<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:19.360> snaps<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.690> shoots<00:03:20.750> back

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
away it snaps it snaps and shoots back

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.080 
away it snaps it snaps and shoots back
to<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.860> Sun<00:03:24.310> guys<00:03:25.310> you're<00:03:25.550> looking<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
to the Sun guys you're looking at a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.479 
to the Sun guys you're looking at a
massive<00:03:26.600> object<00:03:26.810> feeding<00:03:27.709> off<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.010> energy<00:03:28.040> of

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
massive object feeding off the energy of

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.060 
massive object feeding off the energy of
the<00:03:28.640> Sun<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.230> think<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.680> absolutely

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
the Sun and I think it's absolutely

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.760 
the Sun and I think it's absolutely
amazing

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
amazing

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.010 
amazing
watch<00:03:33.770> watch<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.670> energies<00:03:35.060> break<00:03:35.540> right

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
watch watch the energies break right

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.449 
watch watch the energies break right
here<00:03:36.050> watch<00:03:37.180> snap<00:03:38.180> right<00:03:38.780> here<00:03:39.020> boom<00:03:39.470> now<00:03:40.430> it's

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
here watch snap right here boom now it's

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.850 
here watch snap right here boom now it's
free<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.600> starts<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.050> fall<00:03:42.260> back<00:03:44.830> can<00:03:45.830> you

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
free and it starts to fall back can you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
free and it starts to fall back can you
believe<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:47.680> look<00:03:48.680> at<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:49.070> size<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.670> this

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
believe that look at the size of this

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.650 
believe that look at the size of this
thing<00:03:50.680> look<00:03:51.680> at<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.160> size<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.180> comes<00:03:53.420> in

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
thing look at the size of it it comes in

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.660 
thing look at the size of it it comes in
and<00:03:53.810> creeps<00:03:54.140> up<00:03:54.410> right<00:03:54.920> onto<00:03:55.220> it

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
and creeps up right onto it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.340 
and creeps up right onto it
here's<00:03:56.120> earth<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.959> scale<00:03:58.989> for<00:03:59.989> those<00:04:00.140> that

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
here's earth to scale for those that

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
here's earth to scale for those that
never<00:04:00.590> seen<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.130> video

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.050 

that<00:04:04.030> tether<00:04:04.390> right<00:04:04.720> there<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.700> object

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
that tether right there is this object

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.550 
that tether right there is this object
in<00:04:07.720> my<00:04:07.959> opinion<00:04:09.209> refueling<00:04:11.970> getting<00:04:12.970> its<00:04:13.150> gas

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
in my opinion refueling getting its gas

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.780 
in my opinion refueling getting its gas
its<00:04:14.560> energy<00:04:15.690> off<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:17.320> Sun<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:21.370> want<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.639> know

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
its energy off the Sun you want to know

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.330 
its energy off the Sun you want to know
what<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.300> are<00:04:22.540> where<00:04:23.110> we<00:04:23.320> come<00:04:23.590> from<00:04:23.620> our<00:04:24.100> true
