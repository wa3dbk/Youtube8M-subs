00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.919
 hello I'm clear caves and I already missed 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.500
 tell them you are welcome to me 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.410
 channel and if you are new bone you never had 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.240
 seen a video migrants, I hope that 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.710
 you like it and if you have not subscribed then 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.260
 What are you waiting for 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.760
 today in case you have not seen the 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.460
 title that I think is very likely 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.580
 that you have already seen it is about the tag 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.080
 the desert island are 5 questions and I 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.279
 I will answer them related to 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.279
 obviously books and then let's start 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.410
 if you were on a desert island 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.410
 what were the books you would take 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 with you and the first question says a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.269
 book to reread and I chose 'pride and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.039
 prejudice 'because a few days ago what 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.050
 I was reading and I really want to 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.360
 I'm going to analyze it well do not be 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.799
 understand it and be more dependent 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.079
 of details that equal to spend in the 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.699
 first read the second is a book that 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.239
 you have not read but you really want to 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.360
 read and I would take to door holy faith of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.130
 francisco j curtain 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.190
 because they have some days here in my 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.440
 house and I really want to read 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.690
 then he would not take me to this 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.260
 desert adventure 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.720
 the other is books in a series and it's not 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.640
 a complete series but I hope to have the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 complete before getting lost on that island 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.520
 deserted and of course I'm 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520
 speaking of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 those who leave but if it would take them 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 yes yes yes yes yes the fourth 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.200
 question is a children's book then 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.420
 I took the book that introduced me to this 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 the reading then I'm talking a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 horse called freedom and it's a book 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 childish that I also want to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.930
 reread to remember those times of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.340
 youth and without bus 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.950
 I would wear it this is one of my relics 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.080
 and the fifth question is a free option 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 which then you would take in case 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.570
 you were in the desert and that you 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 you can choose so fast I chose the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.130
 that was my number one in the 'top ten' of 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.080
 2014 and I'm talking about wonders 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.660
 although I think it would not be very comfortable 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 because it is a very heavy book very wide 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 but in case you want 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.880
 the option to take something very heavy to me 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.070
 I would wear this I had to see these 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.140
 images and did not have colors then 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.080
 I would use it to draw them but that's not 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.820
 they would do it or I would not do it in my house 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.390
 I'm on a desert island that had 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.960
 colors I would probably do it 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.960
 but no 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.250
 if these would be my faithful companions 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.490
 for my desert island and well I hope that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.110
 they liked it very much and I hope that they 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.459
 I really liked this video 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.280
 Write me in the comments that you 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:09.240
 would like to see and I'm clear to see if 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.240
 I see them the next bye bye bye
