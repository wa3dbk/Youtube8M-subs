00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.040
 Y 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.010
 The first thing we will do is clean and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010
 chop the chicken breasts 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 two 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 i 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.430
 i 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.030
 to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.729
 then we chop and clean the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.729
 mushrooms 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.540
 now we chop the onion 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.200
 in a pan we put plenty of oil and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.200
 we'll start by sautéing the onion 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.929
 ah 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.130
 we will pour some salt 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.980
 when it begins to soften a little 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.090
 we add the carrot and sauté it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.090
 next to the onion 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.960

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.510
 we add the mushrooms 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.360
 after a minute we will lower the fire to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.910
 minimum and we will reserve it while 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.580
 we prepare the knots 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.850
 in a saucepan we will put water and when 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.440
 start to boil add the noodles 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.150

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.900
 minutes just enough for them to stay 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.900

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.510

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.760
