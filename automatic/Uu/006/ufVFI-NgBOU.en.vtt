00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello then I did the tonight 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 spinach spinach millet meatballs flight 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.099
 let you see quickly maybe there 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.900
 I leave the recipe in the info box because 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.600
 in the past it does everything but I am 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.619
 very easy then I left the mile 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:33.090
 and so spin my mile 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:37.829
 then this or me here 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 record here is milled husked lo 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 I find nature so it is very good 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.879
 then in the dough put millet in fact 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 10 to 15 minutes in water are boiled 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 boiling 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 then I chopped the spinach and then I got it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.879
 put a clove of minced garlic 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.010
 oregano, chilli and parmesan vi 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.430
 I leave the doses giumelli infobox yes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 mix everything together in a bowl and then 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 deformed balls are formed 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 so here they are best seen with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 your hands the meatballs the past 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.380
 in breadcrumbs like this and now it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 prepare three here to show you 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.590
 here is as easy as the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.790
 however, these are classic meatballs 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.790
 much more good 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:45.820
 here's so fast then they come here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:57.300
 all beautiful tucks so they pass with a 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:57.300
 some oil and then the oil defends it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:09.940
 here I put some oil 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:12.430
 so on each in the dough I do n't know 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.310
 so it's not a bit of oil on it at all 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.160
 go there are more good are browned 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.180
 they are very crunchy they are very good 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.140
 these also like children and lot 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.210
 therefore which ones in the oven 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.630
 then I prepared the oven 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.860
 I put 220 crickets on a ventilated surface 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.530
 so they are all nice browned 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.709
 completely and then see by eye 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.110
 as when you see that they give themselves that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.690
 they are nice browned and crunchy they are 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.880
 ready also because the ingredients are 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.739
 already all the cooked so they don't have to 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.220
 they just have to brown and they are 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.700
 very good, hello to the next video 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.700
 bye Bye
