00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.910
 It made a good impression on a project that 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.970
 involve to help the government 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.449
 Mexican to break a commercial barrier 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.960
 that there was during 80 years where mexico did not 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.839
 could export avocado to the us and 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.220
 then together with a wonderful team 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.320
 of young people 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.210
 among them a PhD student 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.290
 that had the francisco díaz fleischer that 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.660
 helped me and another 70 young people put together a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.700
 team because the producers of 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.440
 aguacate de michoacán is the association 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 of packers and producers 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 exporters of michoacán avocado 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.080
 together with the Mexican government 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.530
 they looked for me to support them and be able 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.020
 break what I called the myth of the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.060
 fruit fly and avocado and me 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.220
 it was a very father challenge because it is where you 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.340
 you can approach as a scientist 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.490
 solve a real problem of society 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 and more people here in Mexico is the country 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.990
 number one avocado producer at the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.680
 world and could not export to the market 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 more lucrative for a huge lie that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 had invented the Americans in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.190
 the sense that they said that if mexico 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.990
 exported avocados to there they went to 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.090
 go with the avocados the flies of the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 fruit that are a very terrible plague of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.600
 fruit trees and that if it had been a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 terrible problem for them for the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.160
 citrus producers and many others 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 things in the US not then it was a 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.290
 wonderful opportunity to work with 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 the productive sector to collaborate with 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.940
 them and together with the government 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 mexican management authorities 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.030
 of plant health with 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 authorities of the secretariat of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.980
 agriculture of the economy secretariat 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.500
 etcetera make a great team 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.740
 with scientific knowledge and 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.390
 technological break with that barrier and it was 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.700
 an incredible experience not where they 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.680
 one the things that I asked a lot is that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.000
 this was not funded by anyone else 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.370
 that by the same producers of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.010
 avocado then all the research 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.080
 The they paid them in full one 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.030
 new contribution of any kind of good 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.170
 Mexican Mexican government had a role 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.060
 fundamental 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.390
 I repeat the direction of plant health and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.370
 other instances in all procedures 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.730
 but the technical part was solved 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.440
 avocado producers scientists and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.130
 It was a wonderful experience where 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 we work in their gardens where 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.080
 entrance in addition an intellectual exercise 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.940
 very father because in public hearings 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.580
 that there was because this imagine you put on 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.110
 very heavy there were even demands from the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.320
 avocado growers against 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.140
 Secretary of Agriculture of the USA where 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.030
 I had to act as a witness for 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 defend the agriculture secretariat that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.690
 I wanted to open the avocado market in 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.240
 mexico because there was an economic interest 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.280
 very strong then in that audience he 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.080
 they put very heavy I first thing that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.530
 I told them as a scientist not that 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.270
 we like the myths or the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.060
 occurrences I did not tell them to see what 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.940
 we are talking about because you choose avocados 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.730
 avocados of what kind of avocado the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.910
 avocado is a fruit tree there are more than 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.550
 80 species of American persea that is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.350
 the genus and the species this I 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.489
 I was asking everyone who 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.110
 we are talking about which of them 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.840
 study is good let's go to 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.340
 circumscribe it to American persea and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.110
 Then I asked them and now tell me 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.580
 they cultivated what variety because there are more 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.190
 of 500 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.150
 then one is that we focus everything to 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.110
 American persea cultivate hash we already gave 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.260
 a quantum step because we had a 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.160
 focused problem and listener to the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.810
 Americans did not like that but 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.670
 but they had to accept that they were like that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.680
 because all the evidence that they 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.450
 they had and they used against 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.450
 Mexican government 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.280
 there he vanished because the bad news 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.880
 is that if it is persea americana cultivate 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.680
 hash there is not a single publication that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.290
 document that those are the pedros of 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.330
 fruit flies good then the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.490
 American government said ok I bought you the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.770
 argument but now they show that what 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.560
 what you are saying is scientifically 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.170
 valid and then I said good then to 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.840
 that challenge if he got it if then with 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.959
 this team of people with many young people 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 we focus on a scientific method 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.590
 very rigorous to prove that this was not 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.570
 true and how wonderful the case is that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.210
 when we force these flies out of the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.129
 fruit that do not lay eggs in this 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.159
 cultivate avocado 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.139
 to lay an egg because there are ways to 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.270
 click them somehow not the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.929
 avocado reacted very 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.289
 virulent and this agent was defended 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:48.999
 externally that we were getting into and 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.709
 that was fantastic because that was the 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:53.679
 stronger evidence that the 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:55.539
 avocado hass even if attacked from 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:58.719
 artificial way is defended in a way 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.509
 so intense that there's no way that 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:03.279
 this insect fulfills its biological cycle 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.229
 that was the strongest argument that 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.629
 where the Americans said you know 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.219
 that there are dying not those producers of 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.849
 avocado invested one million 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:15.580
 dollars in this research and from 2004 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.009
 that there was total opening because before 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.899
 of 2004 there had already been dabbling with 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.360
 partial openings in times of 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.639
 winter where markets are also very 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.699
 unprofitable when the 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.360
 border in a total way throughout the year 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:34.149
 all the USA have been generated from that era 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.519
 for every 4.5 billion dollars of 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:37.480
 revenues have been created more than 50 thousand 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:41.310
 jobs 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.310
 an investment of one million dollars
