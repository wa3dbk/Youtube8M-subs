00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.710
 [Music] 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.570
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.030
 you are today I bring you a video of 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.330
 solution to the problem that many people 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.580
 will suffer that is that the mobile restarts 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.490
 some people do happen to be 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.830
 Restart the mobile every three days or so 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.689
 but suddenly and there are some people 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.400
 that restarts all the time 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.250
 constantly open an application and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.160
 Pumbaa restarts the mobile this problem 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.350
 it's because your mobile has a layer and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120
 a storage capacity and you 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 you have too many applications or 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.810
 files that prevent the processing of 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.390
 other applications 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.220
 then what happens is that your mobile 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.220
 it's too full of applications 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.290
 we can not store it 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.080
 refers to the memory card because 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.720
 I have a 32 gigabyte card and I think 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.740
 that there is no problem what 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.620
 happens is that the memory to say the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.690
 ram memory for example this one has a 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.820
 a gig of ram memory but the mobile 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.600
 it recognizes 0 97 megs that is 0 97 gigabytes 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.210
 but then the applications are 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.550
 they keep in that memory so that after 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.250
 of the mobile can process those 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.910
 applications then if you fill so much 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 it's storage because it's going to tighten the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.110
 mobile will be able to process other 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.750
 applications and you're going to have to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.260
 restart then let's put an end to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.120
 this what happens you have to make a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.030
 phone reset 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.580
 for it to restart it well well from 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.330
 everything will turn off the mobile as the first 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.000
 He passed 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.170
 let's accept 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.170
 and we wait for it to go out 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.880
 when it is already off, we remove the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.190
 I'm going to remove the memory 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.540
 just in case 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.540
 and not the card but 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.980
 I put the battery and then we access 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.950
 to the recovery mode in this case is the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.400
 combination of the plus volume and the button 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.980
 of ignition search by google mode 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.340
 recovery of such brand of the mobile and already what 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.920
 you will know then we keep until it 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.030
 this green android appears 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 sick you see now we give you the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.730
 arrow back and the menu opens 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 recovery to see if you can see it I'm going to 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.270
 zoom in the camera 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.980
 to move in the recovery menu 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.580
 we have to use the volume buttons 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 and to accept the home button then 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.180
 here we have the options of 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.180
 the first option you do not see the first 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 option but debut system west restart 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.730
 the normal phone and that's it 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.020
 the second option would be application 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.540
 apply updates from the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.180
 memory apply applications or files 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.880
 from the sd card apply from the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.560
 With cache after datafactory 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.410
 reset this is what we care about 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.540
 us is a factory reset or is 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.270
 let's leave the mobile as if it were 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.450
 factory 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.390
 and then backup would be to make a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.090
 backup a system save and rest 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.880
 to restore the backup but what we 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.480
 interesting is the factor and reset then 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.490
 with the volume arrows we are going down 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.700
 until landing on factor and reset a 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.540
 Once in factor and reset we give out to 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.700
 home and here they appear we appear not 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.700
 no no no no 111 little version 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.450
 no no no no no no and then we go down 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.690
 with the things of the volume buttons 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.900
 and we put in yes and we give the home 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.500
 and there it will be processing, says white 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.540
 data form ting data is formatted and 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.320
 here this is going to load us and we're going to 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.740
 Wait until they tell us to reset 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.740
 fulfilled as now it is already telling us 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.240
 with the time for mating 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.180
 team cache data web complete 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.639
 then it is complete then we 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.860
 we went over the option that I read to you 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.720
 principle in the first one that puts the 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.610
 reboot system in out and that's for 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.720
 restart the phone we all spent 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.780
 there and we give the home button we hope to 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.780
 to restart and restart 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.780
 usually 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.240
 once the reset of the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.630
 Factory will show us the mobile as if 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.220
 it was from the factory here, it asks me for the pin 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.220
 of the sim card I'm going to put it 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.890
 then here put cards in changed 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.300
 and already the mobile phone appears as if 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.980
 we would have finished buying 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.770
 the indications of how to use appear 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.690
 the mobile phone and we will have to accept the 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.640
 mobile is good to me it came to me 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.130
 pure android you see all the indications 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.860
 at the beginning of when you use the mobile 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.630
 and it's already factory reset and you're done 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.210
 solved the restart problem of the 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.270
 phone as the phone we will go to 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.150
 the settings 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.940
 consider the adjustments and let's see the 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.070
 storage storage you see the 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.160
 internal storage is totally 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.560
 empty good although there are these 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.450
 applications that already come from 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.850
 factory that we can only remove 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.370
 through the root and through other 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.810
 applications that if you want I upload how 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.060
 do all this to erase these 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.700
 unnecessary applications so that 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.370
 our mobile is more powerful and has 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.660
 more storage equal up to here the 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.050
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.960
 because it 's a very good video for 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.460
 fix that restart problem and if 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.980
 It is like this to give a good light to help 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.270
 this community to grow little by little and if 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.310
 it's the first time you subscribe 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.700
