the little guy and the little guy here

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.750 
the little guy and the little guy here
is<00:04:37.229> just<00:04:37.470> forgetting<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.889> little<00:04:38.099> tiny<00:04:38.340> areas

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
is just forgetting the little tiny areas

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.550

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
so the medium size what I'm going to use

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.400 
so the medium size what I'm going to use
to<00:04:40.770> get<00:04:40.919> right<00:04:41.729> in<00:04:41.880> here<00:04:42.060> behind<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:43.169> brake

this<00:05:20.990> time<00:05:21.199> I'm<00:05:21.260> going<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.410> use<00:05:21.530> just<00:05:21.560> wheel

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
this time I'm going to use just wheel

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.680 
this time I'm going to use just wheel
Woolies<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.550> clean<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.820> entire<00:05:23.150> barrel<00:05:23.600> of

Woolies to clean the entire barrel of

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.240 
Woolies to clean the entire barrel of
the<00:05:23.750> wheel<00:05:23.930> it's<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.500> little<00:05:24.710> bit<00:05:24.800> easier<00:05:24.919> to

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
the wheel it's a little bit easier to

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.800 
the wheel it's a little bit easier to
reach<00:05:25.370> on<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> rear<00:05:25.910> wheels<00:05:26.210> where<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
reach on the rear wheels where the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.379 
reach on the rear wheels where the
calipers<00:05:27.380> are<00:05:27.530> smaller<00:05:27.949> so<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:29.000> wheel<00:05:29.180> will

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
calipers are smaller so the wheel will

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.250 
calipers are smaller so the wheel will
be<00:05:29.419> all<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.810> way<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.020> back<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.380> wheel

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
be all the way to the back of the wheel

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.290 
be all the way to the back of the wheel
and<00:05:33.260> I'm<00:05:33.680> using<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.949> largest<00:05:34.190> one<00:05:34.370> first<00:05:34.610> I

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.490 

was<00:05:38.300> able<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.510> get<00:05:38.630> everything<00:05:38.930> except<00:05:39.380> for

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
was able to get everything except for

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500 
was able to get everything except for
right<00:05:39.680> behind<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.610> caliper<00:05:41.090> again<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.419> I'm

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
right behind the caliper again so I'm

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.879 
right behind the caliper again so I'm
gonna<00:05:41.630> go<00:05:41.750> ahead<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:41.900> use<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.260> medium-size

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
gonna go ahead and use the medium-size

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.670 
gonna go ahead and use the medium-size
wheel<00:05:43.280> Willie<00:05:43.580> for<00:05:43.760> behind<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.150> caliper<00:05:46.030> and

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
wheel Willie for behind the caliper and
