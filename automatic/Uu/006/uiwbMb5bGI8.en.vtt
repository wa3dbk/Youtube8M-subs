it's quite difficult to categorize where

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's quite difficult to categorize where
this<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.660> comes<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> actually<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:32.099> you'll<00:00:32.340> see

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
this one comes in actually as you'll see

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.000 
this one comes in actually as you'll see
it's<00:00:32.669> called<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> new<00:00:33.540> b7<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> got

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's called the the new b7 there you got

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
it's called the the new b7 there you got
the<00:00:35.100> sort<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> clever<00:00:35.550> sort<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> number<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the sort of clever sort of number and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
the sort of clever sort of number and
the<00:00:36.930> idea<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> it's

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the idea with that is that it's it's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.680 
the idea with that is that it's it's
just<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.480> between<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.620> bats<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
just in between the two bats of the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.369 
just in between the two bats of the
sizes<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.290> Harrow<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.460> short<00:00:44.730> handle<00:00:45.379> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
sizes of a Harrow and a short handle so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
sizes of a Harrow and a short handle so
agile<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.280> sizes<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.760> juniors<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.239> from

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
agile know the sizes in juniors go from

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
agile know the sizes in juniors go from
nought<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> 6<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.500> Harrow<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:49.980> short

the GM economy bats to sit just in
between<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.309> help<00:00:56.460> make<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> transition<00:00:57.180> as

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
between to help make that transition as

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
between to help make that transition as
a<00:00:57.510> junior<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:58.050> higher<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> short<00:00:58.890> handle

a junior from higher up to short handle

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.360 
a junior from higher up to short handle
much<00:00:59.670> easier<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.710> show<00:01:01.920> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
much easier or as we in this show it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
much easier or as we in this show it's
just<00:01:02.609> quickly<00:01:02.789> particularly<00:01:03.270> recommend<00:01:03.660> if

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
just quickly particularly recommend if

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
just quickly particularly recommend if
you<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.350> slightly<00:01:04.589> shorter<00:01:04.739> adult<00:01:05.580> if

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you are a slightly shorter adult if

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
you are a slightly shorter adult if
you're<00:01:06.390> somewhere<00:01:06.869> sort<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> around<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> 5<00:01:09.240> 4

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you're somewhere sort of around the 5 4

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.740 
you're somewhere sort of around the 5 4
8<00:01:09.540> 5<00:01:09.810> foot<00:01:10.049> 9<00:01:10.490> height<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
8 5 foot 9 height then you and but you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
8 5 foot 9 height then you and but you
want<00:01:12.960> something<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.380> isn't<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.740> junior<00:01:14.070> bath

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

little bit big

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
little bit big
then<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.220> 7<00:01:17.729> certainly<00:01:18.210> plugs<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.630> gap<00:01:18.930> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
then this 7 certainly plugs that gap in

and in handle and then we'll bring in
the<00:01:47.610> bat<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.939> most<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.750> Newbury<00:01:49.079> GT

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the bat it's most like the Newbury GT

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.969 
the bat it's most like the Newbury GT
players<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:51.170> that's<00:01:52.170> those<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
players and that's those two there you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
players and that's those two there you
can<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> smaller<00:01:54.180> than<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> players

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
can see it is smaller than the players

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050 
can see it is smaller than the players
and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.770> I'll<00:01:55.890> give<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> almost<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and then I'll give you the almost if you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
and then I'll give you the almost if you
like<00:01:57.180> evolution<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.869> man<00:01:58.049> shop<00:01:58.380> starting<00:01:58.829> with

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
like evolution of man shop starting with

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.569 
like evolution of man shop starting with
the<00:01:59.040> smallest<00:01:59.540> on<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.899> left<00:02:01.170> moving<00:02:02.009> towards

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the smallest on your left moving towards

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
the smallest on your left moving towards
the<00:02:02.759> largest<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.509> see<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.899> there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the largest you can see that there

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.340 
the largest you can see that there
hopefully<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> shot<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.079> size

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hopefully you get a shot there the size

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
hopefully you get a shot there the size
is<00:02:07.380> evolving<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.479> shows<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.750> where

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is evolving so that just shows you where

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
is evolving so that just shows you where
it<00:02:10.050> sits<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.830> said<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> are

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it sits in so as I said if you are

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.340 
it sits in so as I said if you are
something<00:02:12.090> around<00:02:12.300> 5<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> 7<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> 5

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
something around 5 to 7 to 5

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.250 
something around 5 to 7 to 5
-<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:13.950> ideal<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.510> also<00:02:15.690> sits<00:02:16.020> well

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
- that's ideal for you it also sits well

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
- that's ideal for you it also sits well
in<00:02:16.440> terms<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.740> weight<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.730> over

very<00:02:43.170> similar<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.130> near<00:02:44.370> bgt<00:02:44.940> which

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
very similar to that near bgt which

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.190 
very similar to that near bgt which
we've<00:02:45.450> done<00:02:45.600> reviews<00:02:45.990> on<00:02:46.170> before<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.400> then

and then just on the side there you'll
see<00:02:50.730> how<00:02:50.880> similar<00:02:51.210> they<00:02:51.450> are<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:52.020> terms<00:02:52.350> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
see how similar they are in terms of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.040 
see how similar they are in terms of
shape<00:02:52.800> incidentally<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> 7<00:02:54.180> quite<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> big<00:02:54.780> bat

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
shape incidentally the 7 quite a big bat

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.370 
shape incidentally the 7 quite a big bat
has<00:02:55.620> got<00:02:55.830> um<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:56.490> 30<00:02:56.730> ml<00:02:57.060> edges<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
has got um just over 30 ml edges so it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.920 
has got um just over 30 ml edges so it
is<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> pretty<00:02:58.830> big<00:02:59.100> bat<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.360> what<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.720> haven't

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
is a pretty big bat but what I haven't

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.660 
is a pretty big bat but what I haven't
even<00:03:01.020> got<00:03:01.320> onto<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.070> mean<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.430> look<00:03:02.580> at
