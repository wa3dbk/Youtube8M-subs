this<00:00:16.470> model<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> bikes<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:19.199> halfway

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
this model of bikes so about halfway

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.490 
this model of bikes so about halfway
through<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> figured<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.500> show

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
through so I figured what I do is show

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
through so I figured what I do is show
you<00:00:22.590> where<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:22.859> at<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:23.970> step<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
you where I'm at and the first step is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.450 
you where I'm at and the first step is
really<00:00:24.420> easy<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> lot<00:00:26.070> easier<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.369> get

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
really easy so it's a lot easier to get

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.099 
really easy so it's a lot easier to get
this<00:00:26.699> far<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:27.869> kind<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this far and then and then kind of

there so it looks round here but the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
there so it looks round here but the
actual<00:01:33.479> piece<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.900> square<00:01:35.720> there<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:37.400> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
actual piece is square there we go that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
actual piece is square there we go that
piece<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.090> front<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.509> square<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.110> what

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
piece in front is square and that's what

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
piece in front is square and that's what
that's<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.920> taken<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that's what we going to be taken out so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.260 
that's what we going to be taken out so
I'm<00:01:42.329> assuming<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> take<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.500> pull

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
I'm assuming we got to take this up pull

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.780 
I'm assuming we got to take this up pull
the<00:01:45.270> bottom<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> air<00:01:45.840> box<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.759> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the bottom of the air box off and so you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.899 
the bottom of the air box off and so you
have<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> unscrew<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:49.110> six<00:01:49.729> screws<00:01:50.729> around

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
have to unscrew these six screws around

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.469 
have to unscrew these six screws around
the<00:01:51.119> outside<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> butterfly<00:01:52.170> valves<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the outside of the butterfly valves and

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
the outside of the butterfly valves and
we'll<00:01:54.479> pull<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> off<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.740> should<00:01:55.979> be

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
we'll pull that off and it should be

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.969 
we'll pull that off and it should be
right<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.610> need<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> pull<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> out

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
right where we need to be to pull it out

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
right where we need to be to pull it out
okay<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.520> done<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.909> far<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> pulled

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
okay so what I've done so far is pulled

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.709 
okay so what I've done so far is pulled
the<00:02:00.689> air<00:02:00.750> box<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.680> slightly<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.600> not

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the air box up slightly and I'm not

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.850 
the air box up slightly and I'm not
gonna<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.469> I'll<00:02:04.649> show<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
gonna take it all off and I'll show you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370 
gonna take it all off and I'll show you
why<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.759> side<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.600> need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> remove<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
why on this side you need to remove this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.969 
why on this side you need to remove this
crankcase<00:02:07.950> breather<00:02:07.979> hose

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
crankcase breather hose

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.589 
crankcase breather hose
that's<00:02:09.129> what<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.519> it<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.640> let's<00:02:10.060> attach

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
that's what I think it is let's attach

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.850 
that's what I think it is let's attach
to<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> head<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.200> mean<00:02:11.349> on<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> Korean<00:02:11.739> case

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
to the head so I mean on the Korean case

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.009 
to the head so I mean on the Korean case
but<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.280> head<00:02:12.610> breather<00:02:12.879> hose<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.870> might

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
but the head breather hose you might

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.690 
but the head breather hose you might
have<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:14.290> oil<00:02:14.560> up<00:02:14.860> in<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.489> lost

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
have a little oil up in here the lost

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.610 
have a little oil up in here the lost
little<00:02:16.680> backsplash<00:02:17.680> filter<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.129> there<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
little backsplash filter in there so you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.130 
little backsplash filter in there so you
have<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> disconnect<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.879> then<00:02:22.420> there's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
have to disconnect this and then there's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.080 
have to disconnect this and then there's
also<00:02:23.409> these<00:02:23.739> two<00:02:23.799> small<00:02:24.370> chime<00:02:24.730> assuming

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
also these two small chime assuming

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.490 
also these two small chime assuming
there's<00:02:25.269> some<00:02:25.390> sort<00:02:25.569> of<00:02:25.660> vacuum<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.260> Bro

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
there's some sort of vacuum to Bro

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.190 
there's some sort of vacuum to Bro
sensor<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.040> because<00:02:27.310> they're<00:02:27.489> only<00:02:27.870> intake<00:02:28.870> or

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
sensor to because they're only intake or

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.830 
sensor to because they're only intake or
the<00:02:29.349> throttle<00:02:29.709> bodies<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.420> you'll<00:02:31.569> need<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the throttle bodies so you'll need to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
the throttle bodies so you'll need to
disconnect<00:02:32.200> those<00:02:32.530> from<00:02:34.319> right<00:02:35.319> here<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
disconnect those from right here and the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.640 
disconnect those from right here and the
last<00:02:37.180> thing<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.629> there<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.140> an<00:02:38.230> electrical

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
last thing is there is an electrical

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.430 
last thing is there is an electrical
connector<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:40.030> there<00:02:40.329> so<00:02:40.629> this<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.170> first

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
connector up there so this is the first

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.559 
connector up there so this is the first
thing<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.769> undid<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.849> then<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.180> did<00:02:43.420> this

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
thing I undid and then I did this

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.680 
thing I undid and then I did this
breather<00:02:43.989> tube<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:44.980> these<00:02:45.160> small

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
breather tube and then these small

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.460 
breather tube and then these small
vacuum<00:02:46.690> hoses<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.280> side<00:02:49.290> you've<00:02:50.290> got

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
vacuum hoses and on this side you've got

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.640 
vacuum hoses and on this side you've got
another<00:02:50.709> mess<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.599> what<00:02:52.599> looks<00:02:53.260> just<00:02:53.440> like

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
another mess of what looks just like

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.039 
another mess of what looks just like
some<00:02:54.129> sort<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.430> drop<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.030> filler<00:02:55.780> tube

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
some sort of a drop to the filler tube

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:56.819 
some sort of a drop to the filler tube
it's<00:02:56.290> empty

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
it's empty

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.369 
it's empty
and<00:02:56.920> then<00:02:57.489> some<00:02:57.670> other<00:02:58.109> cables<00:02:59.109> that<00:02:59.230> look

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
and then some other cables that look

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.819 
and then some other cables that look
won't<00:03:00.220> come<00:03:00.400> off<00:03:00.519> easily<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.739> pulled<00:03:02.739> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
won't come off easily so I pulled the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.190 
won't come off easily so I pulled the
pulled<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:03.970> slightly<00:03:04.329> one<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.840> side<00:03:05.049> was

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
pulled it up slightly one that side was

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.809 
pulled it up slightly one that side was
disconnected<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.799> pulled<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.099> up<00:03:06.190> slightly<00:03:06.489> and

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
disconnected I pulled it up slightly and

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.819 
disconnected I pulled it up slightly and
then<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.120> pull<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.079> forward<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.470> rotate<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
then just pull it forward and rotate it

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.339 
then just pull it forward and rotate it
to<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:08.980> right<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> came<00:03:11.049> out<00:03:11.200> as

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
to the right side and it came out as

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.220 
to the right side and it came out as
fine<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.340> piece<00:03:12.959> we're<00:03:13.959> taking

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
fine so this is the piece we're taking

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.530 
fine so this is the piece we're taking
out<00:03:14.319> two<00:03:14.769> screws<00:03:15.040> right<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.329> I'm<00:03:16.419> going

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
out two screws right there so I'm going

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.080 
out two screws right there so I'm going
to<00:03:16.599> pull<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.900> square<00:03:17.530> piece<00:03:17.769> out<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.250> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
to pull that square piece out and that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.520 
to pull that square piece out and that
will<00:03:19.209> help<00:03:19.389> a<00:03:19.780> little

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
will help a little

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.909 
will help a little
okay<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.120> I've<00:03:22.630> taken<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.079> out<00:03:23.200> that's<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:23.859> it

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
okay so I've taken it out that's what it

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.129 
okay so I've taken it out that's what it
looks<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.130> when<00:03:24.310> you're<00:03:24.430> done<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:25.049> forgot<00:03:26.049> to

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
looks like when you're done I forgot to

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.089 
looks like when you're done I forgot to
mention<00:03:26.230> one<00:03:26.500> last<00:03:26.620> thing<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:26.950> little

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
mention one last thing this little

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.460 
mention one last thing this little
bracket<00:03:27.579> up<00:03:27.849> here<00:03:28.030> there's<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:28.450> screw<00:03:28.840> here

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
bracket up here there's one screw here

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.490 
bracket up here there's one screw here
in<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.709> front<00:03:30.450> for<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.019> forgot<00:03:32.410> to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
in the front for this I forgot to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.720 
in the front for this I forgot to
mention<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.769> take<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.099> out<00:03:33.280> as<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.549> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
mention you take that out as well you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.280 
mention you take that out as well you
probably<00:03:33.910> already<00:03:34.120> got<00:03:34.750> though<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.169> then

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
probably already got though and then

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.599 
probably already got though and then
you'll<00:03:35.829> need<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.040> make<00:03:36.099> sure<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.370> put<00:03:36.519> this

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
you'll need to make sure you put this

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.690 
you'll need to make sure you put this
back<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.970> place<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:38.590> goes<00:03:38.799> where<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.340> tank

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
back in place that goes where the tank

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.110 
back in place that goes where the tank
bolts<00:03:40.060> go<00:03:40.319> so<00:03:41.319> that's<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.370> taking<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.880> apart

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
bolts go so that's it taking it apart

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.670 
bolts go so that's it taking it apart
reversing<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:43.660> do<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> exact<00:03:44.200> same<00:03:44.380> thing

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
reversing you do the exact same thing
