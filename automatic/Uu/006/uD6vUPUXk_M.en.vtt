00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.340 

we've<00:01:50.740> been<00:01:50.920> what<00:01:51.880> I've<00:01:52.000> been<00:01:52.180> here<00:01:52.510> at<00:01:52.690> canted

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
we've been what I've been here at canted

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.110 
we've been what I've been here at canted
in<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.500> while<00:01:53.650> for<00:01:53.800> 18<00:01:54.160> years<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.760> we've<00:01:54.940> been

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
in a while for 18 years and we've been

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.960 
in a while for 18 years and we've been
with<00:01:55.300> mövenpick<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.740> all<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.010> time<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.580> I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
with mövenpick for all that time and I

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.510 
with mövenpick for all that time and I
think<00:01:58.210> for<00:01:58.480> some<00:01:58.930> years<00:01:59.350> before<00:01:59.590> as<00:01:59.920> well<00:02:00.100> so

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
think for some years before as well so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.610 
think for some years before as well so
we<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:00.940> say<00:02:01.660> that<00:02:01.840> we<00:02:01.930> consider<00:02:02.110> them<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:02.500> a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
we can say that we consider them as a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.680 
we can say that we consider them as a
long-term<00:02:03.130> partners<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.910> kindred<00:02:04.870> noble<00:02:06.690> if

long-term partners of kindred noble if

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.999 
long-term partners of kindred noble if
