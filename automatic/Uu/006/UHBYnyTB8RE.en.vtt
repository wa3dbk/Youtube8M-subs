erode him around fairhill advanced and

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.679 
erode him around fairhill advanced and
he<00:04:52.129> jumped<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.699> a<00:04:52.729> little<00:04:52.969> bit<00:04:53.090> differently<00:04:53.449> to

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
he jumped in a little bit differently to

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.689 
he jumped in a little bit differently to
what<00:04:53.840> I'd<00:04:53.960> been<00:04:54.289> thinking<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.189> way<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> jump

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
what I'd been thinking the way to jump

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.550 
what I'd been thinking the way to jump
in<00:04:55.819> and<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.509> horse<00:04:56.719> jump<00:04:56.930> really<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:57.229> well

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
in and the horse jump really really well

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.159 
in and the horse jump really really well
so<00:04:57.830> I'm<00:04:57.919> actually<00:04:58.069> sort<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.719> picking<00:04:59.719> up<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.990> few

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
so I'm actually sort of picking up a few

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.409 
so I'm actually sort of picking up a few
things<00:05:00.229> on<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.710> ground<00:05:00.949> of<00:05:01.159> ways<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:01.939> can<00:05:02.150> tweak

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
things on the ground of ways I can tweak

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.600 
things on the ground of ways I can tweak
my<00:05:02.449> riding<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.469> training<00:05:03.560> for<00:05:03.860> when<00:05:04.159> I<00:05:04.189> make

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
my riding and training for when I make

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.999 
my riding and training for when I make
it<00:05:04.759> come<00:05:04.909> back<00:05:04.939> so<00:05:05.330> we<00:05:05.360> are<00:05:05.840> something<00:05:06.259> that's

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
it come back so we are something that's

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.559
