really ought to know about music it all
related<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.839> music<00:00:07.049> theory<00:00:07.589> we've<00:00:08.189> talked

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
related to music theory we've talked

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.759 
related to music theory we've talked
about<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.849> various<00:00:09.120> kinds<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.630> scales<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
about the various kinds of scales and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.259 
about the various kinds of scales and
today<00:00:11.070> I'd<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.370> point<00:00:11.670> out<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.030> fact

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
today I'd like to point out the fact

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.289 
today I'd like to point out the fact
it's<00:00:12.719> an<00:00:12.840> obvious<00:00:12.990> fact<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.179> think<00:00:15.179> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it's an obvious fact but I think I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.870 
it's an obvious fact but I think I
didn't<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.049> years<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.220> melodies

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
didn't get it for years but all melodies

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.540 
didn't get it for years but all melodies
are<00:00:18.119> made<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.590> scales<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:20.010> scale

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
are made out of scales or scale

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.689 
are made out of scales or scale
fragments<00:00:21.210> or<00:00:21.330> broken<00:00:22.320> chords<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.189> sort

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
fragments or broken chords of some sort

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.240 
fragments or broken chords of some sort
okay<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.350> today<00:00:25.350> I'd<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> look<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.039> at

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
okay and today I'd like to look at at

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.519 
okay and today I'd like to look at at
songs<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.240> made<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.750> scales

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
songs that are just made out of scales

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.550 
songs that are just made out of scales
for<00:00:28.859> examples<00:00:29.250> let<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> blue<00:00:30.560> blue

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
for examples let me take this blue blue

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:51.380 
for examples let me take this blue blue
tune<00:00:48.590> now<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.010> awful<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.399> it's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
tune now that was pretty awful but it's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
tune now that was pretty awful but it's
made<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.199> nothing<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> blue

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
made out of just nothing with the blue

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:08.690 
made out of just nothing with the blue
scale<00:01:06.619> okay<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
scale okay that's all there is to it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.260 
scale okay that's all there is to it
okay

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
okay

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.080 
okay
and<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> blue<00:01:10.740> scale<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and if you know the blue scale it the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
and if you know the blue scale it the
blue<00:01:12.210> scale<00:01:12.479> uses<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> major<00:01:14.070> third

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
blue scale uses not only the major third

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
blue scale uses not only the major third
but<00:01:14.460> he<00:01:14.520> uses<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> minor<00:01:15.060> third<00:01:15.450> too<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.409> then

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
but he uses a minor third too and then

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100 
but he uses a minor third too and then
it<00:01:16.680> uses<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> flat<00:01:17.700> fast<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> key

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it uses the flat fast which in the key

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.560 
it uses the flat fast which in the key
of<00:01:19.170> F<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.650> C<00:01:20.070> flat<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.450> uses

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of F would be C flat and then it uses

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
of F would be C flat and then it uses
the<00:01:21.750> flat<00:01:21.960> seven<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> blues

scale<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:24.060> always<00:01:24.180> looking<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.630> flat

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
scale you're always looking for a flat

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
third a flat seventh and sometimes a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
third a flat seventh and sometimes a
flat<00:01:27.180> fifth<00:01:27.509> okay

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
did you recognize it it's just a C scale

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.100 
did you recognize it it's just a C scale
isn't<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:01.910> if<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.090> put<00:02:02.330> rhythm<00:02:02.660> in<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> we

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110

from<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.360> top<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.900> if<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:13.250> did<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.700> key

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
from the top down if I did it in the key

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.420 
from the top down if I did it in the key
that<00:02:13.910> Georg<00:02:14.660> Friedrich<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.230> Handel<00:02:16.160> wrote<00:02:16.190> it

in<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> would<00:02:16.760> be<00:02:20.380> nothing<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:21.620> d<00:02:22.550> scale<00:02:22.850> right

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
in it would be nothing but d scale right

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.690 
in it would be nothing but d scale right
if<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.780> played<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.140> an<00:02:24.200> e-flat<00:02:27.430> nothing<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.580> the
