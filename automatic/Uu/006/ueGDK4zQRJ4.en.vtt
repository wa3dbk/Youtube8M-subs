00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
AMG first off the transmission can be a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
AMG first off the transmission can be a
total<00:00:49.620> pain<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> ass<00:00:50.480> sometimes<00:00:51.480> when

total pain in the ass sometimes when

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.960 
total pain in the ass sometimes when
you're<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.379> shifting<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.010> slowing<00:00:53.340> down<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
you're up shifting but slowing down the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.360 
you're up shifting but slowing down the
car<00:00:54.150> violently<00:00:54.660> lurches<00:00:55.110> forward<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:56.070> never

car violently lurches forward it never

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.670 
car violently lurches forward it never
seems<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.150> down<00:00:57.360> shifts<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.080> fast<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
seems to do down shifts as fast as you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.350 
seems to do down shifts as fast as you
would<00:00:58.830> like<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.580> up<00:00:59.790> shifts<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
would like or even up shifts and

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.329 
would like or even up shifts and
sometimes<00:01:01.290> when<00:01:01.589> you<00:01:01.680> click<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> downshift

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
sometimes when you click for a downshift

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.899 
sometimes when you click for a downshift
it<00:01:02.820> simply<00:01:03.420> doesn't<00:01:03.780> respond<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it simply doesn't respond this is in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
it simply doesn't respond this is in
stark<00:01:06.180> contrast<00:01:06.409> while<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> 7-speed

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
stark contrast while it is a 7-speed

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
stark contrast while it is a 7-speed
like<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> PDK<00:01:09.930> system<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> Porsche<00:01:10.920> system

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like the PDK system the Porsche system

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.399 
like the PDK system the Porsche system
feels<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.479> better<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.080> terms<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
feels so much better in terms of

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
feels so much better in terms of
responsiveness<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.280> second<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> click<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
responsiveness the second you click the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780 
responsiveness the second you click the
paddle<00:01:15.420> boom<00:01:16.020> there's<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> shift<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.580> don't

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
paddle boom there's a shift so I don't

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
paddle boom there's a shift so I don't
really<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.200> seat<00:01:19.440> does<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.799> get

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
really like that the seat does not get

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590 
really like that the seat does not get
close<00:01:20.220> enough<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.850> steering<00:01:21.240> wheel<00:01:21.360> for

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
close enough to the steering wheel for

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
close enough to the steering wheel for
proper<00:01:21.900> driving<00:01:22.290> position<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.250> borderline

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
proper driving position it's borderline

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
proper driving position it's borderline

shorter than that you're more likely to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
shorter than that you're more likely to
be<00:01:28.020> riding<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> gangster<00:01:29.130> than<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> are

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
some of the most beautiful I've ever

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.380 
some of the most beautiful I've ever
experienced<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.679> car<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.789> bass<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
experienced in a car the bass is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
experienced in a car the bass is
absolutely<00:01:43.350> terrible<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> play<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> song

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
absolutely terrible if you play a song

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
absolutely terrible if you play a song
with<00:01:45.240> heavy<00:01:45.479> bass<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.049> almost<00:01:46.409> sounds<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
with heavy bass it almost sounds like

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
with heavy bass it almost sounds like
the<00:01:47.340> subwoofer<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> blown<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.920> it's<00:01:49.920> been

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the subwoofer is blown and it's been

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
the subwoofer is blown and it's been
tested<00:01:50.369> many<00:01:50.939> times<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.840> subwoofer<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tested many times the subwoofer in this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.130 
tested many times the subwoofer in this
car<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.310> blown<00:01:53.789> that's<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
car is not blown that's just the way it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.399 
car is not blown that's just the way it
sounds<00:01:55.909> for<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> supercar<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.840> card<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> not

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
sounds for a supercar the card is not

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
sounds for a supercar the card is not
actually<00:01:58.920> handled<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.850> well

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
actually handled that well

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.809 
actually handled that well
apparently<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.679> much<00:02:02.039> corrected<00:02:02.640> in

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
apparently this was much corrected in

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.870 
apparently this was much corrected in
the<00:02:02.850> SLS<00:02:03.390> Black<00:02:03.659> Series<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.560> new<00:02:04.710> AMG<00:02:05.100> GT

the SLS Black Series and the new AMG GT

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 
the SLS Black Series and the new AMG GT
I<00:02:06.179> wasn't<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.289> expecting<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> more

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I wasn't really expecting it it is more

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
I wasn't really expecting it it is more
of<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.819> GT<00:02:09.030> Cruiser<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:10.020> something<00:02:10.410> like

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of a GT Cruiser it's not something like

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.280 
of a GT Cruiser it's not something like
a<00:02:10.560> Porsche<00:02:10.890> gt3<00:02:11.280> RS<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.390> still<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.050> think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
a Porsche gt3 RS but still if you think

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.320 
a Porsche gt3 RS but still if you think
and<00:02:13.410> feel<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> little<00:02:13.740> bit<00:02:13.890> better<00:02:14.330> when

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and feel a little bit better when

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
and feel a little bit better when
backing<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:16.050> head<00:02:16.230> hits<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> centre

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
backing up your head hits the centre

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.200 
backing up your head hits the centre
thing<00:02:17.160> every<00:02:17.550> time<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:20.430> your<00:02:20.550> passenger<00:02:20.790> is

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
thing every time if your passenger is
