00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.939
 hello very good in this video we are going to 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.810
 see the concept of parity control 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.820
 ok to see what that is and where it applies 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.590
 well this case a very typical example of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.350
 parity control we see it in the raid 5 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.660
 is worth where we are going to suppose for example 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.050
 that we have three discs the one and two 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 three 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.180
 well in this video what we are going to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.460
 to do in a very simple way 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.140
 and with and with binary numbers 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.610
 let's try to explain what is 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.070
 parity control and what it is that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.989
 it really happens in the raid 5 voucher 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.970
 I repeat we will do it in a way 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.489
 very very simple that then in the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.500
 actually it does it runs from a 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.480
 more complex way, especially for 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.730
 that you understand that concept of control of 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.920
 parity well then imagine that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.809
 remember that the parity control in the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.390
 raid 5 is saved in a way 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 indistinct in the three discs that is 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.830
 if for example I write 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 on this disk number one writes a zero 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.009
 and then in one 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.200
 if for example we are going to execute a 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.539
 parity control par this is going to 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.049
 mean for example that we would have 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.640
 that there should always be in every sweep of 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.149
 saved data there should be a 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.009
 even number of one then what 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.009
 we would need then it would be 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.250
 in this case here put a good one what 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 I'm marking different color is worth now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.650
 imagine that we are still 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.220
 writing and now I write in this 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.090
 write a 1 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.100
 and in this other album I write another 1 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.850
 then the parity control what's going 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.630
 to do is write in this second a 0 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.110
 ok because there is already an even number of 1 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.610
 in the next case imagine that what 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.610
 what he writes is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.500
 here for example a zero 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.500
 and here 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.430
 another 0 then control the control of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.490
 parity in this case what has to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.900
 have is an even number of 1 in this case 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.120
 since there is none, I would have to 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.230
 write the parity control would have 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.600
 what to write a 0 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.360
 let's go with another example if you write here 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.710
 a 0 and on the second disk write a 1 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.370
 I would have to write 1 as 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.560
 would be 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.950
 11 so there would be an even number of 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.190
 numbers one okay with this let's do 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 another last example 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 it will assume that such 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.480
 here he writes 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.060
 0 and here write 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.940
 this case we have already given and here 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.640
 write for example the first write 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.640
 a zero and this one writes 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.600
 in the third point in the second the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.030
 parity control 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.840
 it would have to be 11 for there to be a 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.840
 even number of 1 so that what is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 doing parity control is worth and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.710
 like the rail 5 the parity keeps it in 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.650
 each one of the discs is worth what 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.410
 we are seeing here what happens the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.950
 history of all this is that if so 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.530
 that is to lose a disk the system 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.980
 would continue to work we will make a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.930
 thing we are going to catch 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.930
 and here, apart 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.829
 ok let's aim the numbers 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.090
 for example of the disk that we lose by 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.340
 example I guess we're going to lose the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.770
 disk number 2 then this has a 1 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.720
 OK 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.820
 a parity zero 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.120
 11 also starting here we are going to 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.479
 point also the other 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.040
 here a zero and here one that's the 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.109
 information that would have value but let's 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.110
 to imagine that we are going to lose this 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.270
 we are simply pointing it here 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.039
 ok for 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.660
 so that later you see that what happens 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.979
 it's good to imagine that we lose the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.800
 disk is worth all this information 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.300
 disappears vale is destroyed well for 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.889
 be clearer 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.990
 this information disappears 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.420
 so what happens what 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.220
 as there is parity control the system 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.320
 it would continue to work right now 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.530
 system could continue to work with 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.449
 one another because because he knows 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.729
 Really 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.039
 the information that is saved here in 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.979
 disc number 2 because by control 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:07.229
 of parity because if we're going to put it on 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.229
 another color so you can see it clearly 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.260
 if there is a zero here and here is a 1 is 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.170
 because here here in theory I would have to 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.639
 have the one that is parity control 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.639
 so there would have to be another one not 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.249
 then that would do so much at the time of 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.900
 when it comes to reading the information it's worth 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:32.199
 notice that this should go 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.550
 continuously running the system itself 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.099
 yes he will get to read what is here 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.650
 I would read that there is a 111 therefore here 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.669
 there is a zero 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.270
 ok and I would do it but fix this 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.510
 it would be the readings now that it happens that 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.009
 if we 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.430
 and insert 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.349
 a totally new disc we insert the 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.789
 disk in the system what does the 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.529
 process is automatically generate what 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.990
 what does it generate the information that 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:07.050
 there should be, and in this case, what 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.839
 would do as we have been seeing if there is a 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.270
 0 and 1 1 this you have to save a 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.030
 even number one by one 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.100
 here is a 1 and a 1 in this case the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.650
 parity control would say that here's a 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.419
 zero 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:27.350
 here 0 and 0 well here a 0 is worth it because no 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.060
 there is none here a 1 and a 0 here that 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.360
 there would have to be a 1 to do 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.000
 park parity 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.430
 and here 10 and 11 that should have 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.789
 here for another one to see an even number 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.830
 of one if we realize what 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.699
 we write here to the left is 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.110
 exactly the same as it has rebuilt 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:50.400
 disc number two with the new one that 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.560
 we have gotten worth then I repeat 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.139
 first if the disk fails the system 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.969
 it keeps working because he finds out what 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.400
 information there is in the second it does from 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:03.460
 parallel to the execution of the 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.789
 system that yes the system slows down 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.110
 Now what happens if we insert a 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:12.849
 totally new disc what it does is 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.550
 calculate what information was in this 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.740
 disc what he writes reconstructs the 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.539
 disk and the system returns again to 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.599
 operate at full capacity with the 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:25.810
 three discs okay then well this 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:28.840
 so simple we have seen that it does 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:34.050
 really a ray 5 and specifically with the 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.050
 parity control is worth come to another
