00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys today I present you some 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.509
 buildings arrive from Denmark 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.799
 we see that the type i lego are a bit 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.330
 fixed on buildings 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.740
 these are completely though 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 innovative difference of traditional 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.109
 that we knew about pop and plastic 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 kind of different or softer plastic 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.189
 if so it can be said it is a bit to be 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 human true form to have this form 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.550
 here and after we will see better in the example 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.420
 construction that follows my first 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.789
 presentation or this form at 300 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.529
 if we want to call it that is unique as 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 you only see the color that changes 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 allows you to make combinations of 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.149
 almost endless constructions ad 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 example I built a sheep 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.870
 as you can see there are no instructions 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.100
 to do so the little book that accompanies it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 we'll see inspirations later 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 freedom is totally unspoiled 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.050
 absolute fantasy in power you only have to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 think what you want to achieve e 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 I assure you that the plus plus vi 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 allow you to do it then in practice there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.539
 they are both in the version for the little ones 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 then this magnitude is version 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.790
 mini for the older ones but let's start with the 3 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.180
 years and older children with color 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.130
 normal and the classic primary colors e 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 with value also fashion neon hitch year 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.689
 with colors a little more or a little stronger 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 to realize that perhaps objects with i 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.180
 more exposed in fact possible to realize 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.430
 bracelets and small kitchens 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.049
 of glasses and so on but now 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.030
 we will see examples of what we will see 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 how to build with this new type 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.960
 of construction and here we are as promised 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 let's move to the construction this as vi 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 I said it is the sheep that is moralized now 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 I feel we are going to make with flower 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 so to understand what the right is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.770
 constructive mode the face in 2d 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 because I can understand it even better 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.740
 up from the camera then we go up with 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.940
 the cat of our flower and see 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 the joint is beautiful 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.530
 therefore it is also possible to play games 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.390
 vertical it is also possible to rotate 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.830
 so understand first when I told you that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.470
 you can make your own bracelet 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.940
 possible because I can rotate in this 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.830
 way the pieces thing with great with others 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.930
 construction I can't do is keep 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.570
 however the structure is rather solid 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.380
 let 's put the leaf here and a leaf 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.120
 when then up here we start ours 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.800
 flower 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.140
 so let's start with a square shape 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.410
 with the first petal we make ours 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.510
 pistils de and then we can go up 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.510
 those that will be the petals of the flower 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:37.220
 and here tropeano so on 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.420
 and so we make everything the same all red 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.790
 obviously those colors can be done 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.700
 indulge and you can really do it 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.200
 shapes of any kind and then on the base 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.150
 of this square I go to give a shape 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.320
 in our way sea that remembers a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.110
 real top flower 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.240
 what can someone do as I told you? 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.940
 you can definitely do it all 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.070
 sees right in the information brochure 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.140
 that accompanies the game you can 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.630
 make a circus even even 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.970
 make the tent this thanks to the al 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.710
 mini model that allows more 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.470
 elasticity and even notice more surfaces 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.960
 thin is obviously a machine 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 even formed in tow and then I 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.870
 I said exactly the chaplet here or 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.790
 also written for example a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.270
 message for Pope stating that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.890
 tend to home and then also because 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.840
 may be interesting not just for 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.540
 make a pirate bandage a bracelet 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.190
 which is an aspect to or a note of 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.450
 birthday in short, the possibilities are 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.950
 really endless in construction and not 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.720
 There are therefore as the said extraction 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.730
 it's about trying and trying again a 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.500
 therefore very intense game take a 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.520
 bit of a bit but above all take yourself 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.800
 so much imagination 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.800
 see you soon at the next video beams
