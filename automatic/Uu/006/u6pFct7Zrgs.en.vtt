okay<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.620> go<00:00:01.949> Peppa's<00:00:03.589> long-term

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay so here we go Peppa's long-term

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.280 
okay so here we go Peppa's long-term
discussion<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.150> filtration<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
discussion about the filtration of the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.280 
discussion about the filtration of the
transmission<00:00:08.099> filters<00:00:08.550> folks<00:00:09.420> let's<00:00:10.110> be

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
transmission filters folks let's be

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.410 
transmission filters folks let's be
honest<00:00:10.620> if<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.400> put<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> filter<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
honest if you put a filter on the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.099 
honest if you put a filter on the
suction<00:00:12.900> side<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:14.340> pump<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:15.240> transmission

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
suction side of a pump or transmission

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.029 
suction side of a pump or transmission
and<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:17.550> filters<00:00:17.910> too<00:00:18.420> restrictive<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.710> gets

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and the filters too restrictive or gets

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.970 
and the filters too restrictive or gets
clogged<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:21.359> clogged<00:00:21.779> what's<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> end

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
clogged or clogged what's going to end

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.080 
clogged or clogged what's going to end
up<00:00:23.100> happening<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> have

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
up happening is you're going to have

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
up happening is you're going to have
suction<00:00:24.660> problems<00:00:25.109> you're<00:00:25.320> gonna<00:00:25.380> have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
suction problems you're gonna have

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
suction problems you're gonna have
deprivation<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.539> transmission<00:00:27.539> fluid<00:00:27.689> going

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
deprivation of transmission fluid going

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.830 
deprivation of transmission fluid going
into<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> transmission<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.840> long-term

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
into the transmission and long-term

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780 
into the transmission and long-term
results<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.590> catastrophic

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
results is can be catastrophic

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.450 
results is can be catastrophic
so<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> transmission

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so what we have in the transmission

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
so what we have in the transmission
might<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.149> called<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> filter<00:00:36.870> might<00:00:37.200> look<00:00:37.469> like

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
might be called a filter might look like

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.190 
might be called a filter might look like
a<00:00:37.710> filter<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.000> isn't<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.690> filter

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
a filter but it really isn't the filter

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.709 
a filter but it really isn't the filter
is<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> screen<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is more of a screen you can look at it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
is more of a screen you can look at it
as<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> metal<00:00:43.260> screen<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.829> Toyota<00:00:44.250> used

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
as a metal screen which Toyota used

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
as a metal screen which Toyota used
quite<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.020> use<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.860> as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
quite a bit or you can use look at it as

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
quite a bit or you can use look at it as
a<00:00:47.010> fibrous<00:00:47.700> screen<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.780> what<00:00:49.079> these

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
a fibrous screen which is what these

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
a fibrous screen which is what these
newer<00:00:49.680> transmissions<00:00:50.399> seem<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.760> putting

newer transmissions seem to be putting

see<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.670> your<00:02:04.000> engine<00:02:04.600> oil<00:02:04.720> now<00:02:05.710> there's<00:02:05.890> some

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
see in your engine oil now there's some

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.740 
see in your engine oil now there's some
black<00:02:06.280> bits<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:06.939> that's<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.330> me<00:02:07.450> cutting

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
black bits on that that's for me cutting

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.419 
black bits on that that's for me cutting
open<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.080> plastic<00:02:08.380> container<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.280> see

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
fluid it's going to be trapped so you

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.360 
fluid it's going to be trapped so you
need<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.750> get<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> magnifying<00:04:55.349> filter<00:04:55.889> inline

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
need to get a magnifying filter inline

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.909 
need to get a magnifying filter inline
and<00:04:56.669> why<00:04:57.300> bother<00:04:57.539> changing<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.229> screen<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
and why bother changing the screen the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.589 
and why bother changing the screen the
screen<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.370> just<00:04:59.520> gonna<00:04:59.669> open<00:04:59.820> up<00:05:00.090> your<00:05:00.210> filter

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
screen is just gonna open up your filter

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.990 
screen is just gonna open up your filter

floating<00:05:03.389> around<00:05:03.449> every<00:05:03.780> time<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:03.990> drop<00:05:04.259> that

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
floating around every time you drop that

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.279 
floating around every time you drop that
pan<00:05:04.740> you're<00:05:05.430> freeing<00:05:05.820> up<00:05:05.970> more<00:05:06.289> ferrous

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
transmission I think it's the dumbest

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.969 
transmission I think it's the dumbest
idea<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:12.229> but<00:05:13.229> that's<00:05:13.470> just<00:05:13.710> me<00:05:13.949> I

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
idea there is but that's just me I

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.100 
idea there is but that's just me I
somewhat<00:05:14.940> controversial<00:05:15.419> when<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.720> comes<00:05:15.990> to

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
somewhat controversial when it comes to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.770 
somewhat controversial when it comes to
my<00:05:16.199> opinions<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.400> do<00:05:18.120> what<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.360> want<00:05:18.539> it's

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
my opinions so do what you want it's

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.480 
my opinions so do what you want it's
your<00:05:18.900> transmission<00:05:19.530> if<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.680> want<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:20.010> last

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
your transmission if you want it to last

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.969 
your transmission if you want it to last
do<00:05:21.030> what<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.240> tell<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.659> do<00:05:21.810> if<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.680> don't

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
do what I tell you to do if you don't

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.330 
do what I tell you to do if you don't
care<00:05:23.479> change<00:05:24.479> your<00:05:24.630> filter<00:05:25.020> media<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.650> let

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
care change your filter media and let

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.159 
care change your filter media and let
this<00:05:26.580> crap<00:05:26.820> still<00:05:27.150> circulate<00:05:27.690> through<00:05:27.960> your

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
this crap still circulate through your

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.500 
this crap still circulate through your
transmission<00:05:28.800> over<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.520> over<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.240> over

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
transmission over and over and over

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.990 
transmission over and over and over
again<00:05:31.130> let's<00:05:32.130> see<00:05:32.250> if<00:05:32.310> we<00:05:32.370> can<00:05:32.490> get<00:05:32.610> any<00:05:32.760> more

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
again let's see if we can get any more

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.420 
again let's see if we can get any more
of<00:05:33.060> this<00:05:33.150> crap<00:05:33.539> off

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
of this crap off

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.710 
of this crap off
so<00:05:36.430> there's<00:05:36.610> still<00:05:36.759> bits<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.150> can't<00:05:37.449> get<00:05:37.599> off

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
so there's still bits I can't get off

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480 
so there's still bits I can't get off
them<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.349> magnetics<00:05:38.860> I'm<00:05:39.009> gonna<00:05:39.159> set<00:05:39.370> this

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
them the magnetics I'm gonna set this

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.350 
them the magnetics I'm gonna set this
back<00:05:39.759> down<00:05:40.000> here<00:05:40.860> look<00:05:41.860> at<00:05:41.949> this<00:05:42.069> this<00:05:43.060> is<00:05:43.240> the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
back down here look at this this is the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.379 
back down here look at this this is the
crap<00:05:43.599> after<00:05:43.840> 30,000<00:05:44.800> miles<00:05:45.030> this<00:05:46.030> isn't<00:05:46.360> a

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
crap after 30,000 miles this isn't a

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.969 
crap after 30,000 miles this isn't a
hundred<00:05:46.659> thousand<00:05:47.050> this<00:05:47.139> is<00:05:47.259> thirty<00:05:47.500> thousand

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
hundred thousand this is thirty thousand

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.800 
hundred thousand this is thirty thousand
miles<00:05:48.159> there's<00:05:48.580> bits<00:05:48.939> and<00:05:49.180> pieces<00:05:49.419> all<00:05:49.750> over

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
miles there's bits and pieces all over

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.230 
miles there's bits and pieces all over
here<00:05:50.349> that<00:05:51.129> would<00:05:51.280> have<00:05:51.370> otherwise<00:05:51.490> continued

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
here that would have otherwise continued

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.450 
here that would have otherwise continued
to<00:05:52.360> circulate<00:05:52.599> through<00:05:52.990> my<00:05:53.110> transmission<00:05:55.050> now

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
to circulate through my transmission now

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.670 
to circulate through my transmission now
we<00:05:57.460> I<00:05:57.669> can<00:05:57.879> show<00:05:58.090> you<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.270> fancy<00:05:58.599> fibrous<00:05:59.289> filter

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
we I can show you a fancy fibrous filter

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.939 
we I can show you a fancy fibrous filter
and<00:06:00.340> that<00:06:00.370> means<00:06:00.669> nothing<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.419> me<00:06:01.710> this<00:06:02.710> means

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
and that means nothing to me this means

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.249 
and that means nothing to me this means
a<00:06:03.310> lot<00:06:03.729> to<00:06:03.939> me<00:06:04.090> this<00:06:04.659> means<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.110> I'm

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
a lot to me this means that I'm

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.439 
a lot to me this means that I'm
filtering<00:06:05.590> my<00:06:05.919> transmission<00:06:06.639> my<00:06:06.940> fluid<00:06:07.330> is

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
filtering my transmission my fluid is

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.719 
filtering my transmission my fluid is
clean<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.020> it's<00:06:08.620> free<00:06:08.919> of<00:06:09.069> the<00:06:09.190> harmful<00:06:09.610> to

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
clean and it's free of the harmful to

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.249 
clean and it's free of the harmful to
debris<00:06:10.240> that's<00:06:10.479> gonna<00:06:10.599> be<00:06:10.810> flowing<00:06:11.080> through

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
debris that's gonna be flowing through

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.770 
debris that's gonna be flowing through
the<00:06:11.590> transmission<00:06:12.280> so<00:06:13.060> make<00:06:13.419> up<00:06:13.539> your<00:06:13.569> own

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
the transmission so make up your own

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.629 
the transmission so make up your own
mind<00:06:14.020> I'm<00:06:14.830> kind<00:06:15.069> of<00:06:15.129> done<00:06:15.310> with<00:06:15.370> this

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639
