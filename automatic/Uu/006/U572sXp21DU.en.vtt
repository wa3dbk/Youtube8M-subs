00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:10.349
 tell your mind, man, it was worth days by 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 general example is too good to speak and not to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 That you were only one of mine. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 guinea pigs when the world is mine 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.770
 this human practice of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.770
 talking that much bothers me 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 now I can give my name are meco 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.890
 seeing this text that basically writes 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.469
 all I speak good'll teach 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 how to create this system and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 first thing you have to understand 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 is that all the text in the unity we 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 variables of type 31 and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.370
 all trim is nothing more than a vector 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.799
 Dynamic of english teas characters 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 knowing the logic to create this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.210
 system is simply to get a 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 component that displays a 30 on the screen 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.850
 in the limit we will use ypanÃ© lÃ©o and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 then we enrolled 1 ee test 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 now we go to the critics just remembering that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.770
 whenever we are going to use resources in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.159
 we must import the limit already in point and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.470
 and now we create our variables one that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 reference the screen test to the other 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.400
 stream type that will contain the text in the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.680
 its totality 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 plus an integer type to contain the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 value of the vector content of tea 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.689
 we are 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.119
 another variable that controls the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.549
 speed with which we want each 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.670
 character appears on the screen and an 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.619
 let's go through the vector of char 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 out of 30 and primordial to its size 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.500
 maximum and each time the time is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.880
 exceeded by the time counter 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.189
 we add the character of the time to the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.680
 our screen test by accessing your 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.259
 test property and adding this new 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.300
 character to skip lines use a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.330
 No operator rod 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.300
 it is a logic that you can create too 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.000
 is to make use of special characters or 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.940
 not widely used for actions such as 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.740
 example to clear the text in this case and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.110
 zezÃ© di camargo and luciano 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.600
 when is the character of the time does the value 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.730
 of the test test receive a text 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.250
 empty or the clothes that make the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 time counter instead of turning after 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.860
 insert the receive minus two character 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.660
 so it will take two seconds more time 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.819
 normal waiting time so the next 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.329
 characters is entered 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.700
 That's what I wanted to show you now. 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.389
 with the bruno show 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.389
 bye
