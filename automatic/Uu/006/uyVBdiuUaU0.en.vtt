off course it simply knew that we were
going<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> wrong<00:04:00.940> direction<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:02.380> how<00:04:03.070> is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
going in the wrong direction what how is

that possible maybe aunt re was right
maybe<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.120> Super<00:04:07.450> Robot<00:04:07.600> really<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.470> more

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
maybe the Super Robot really is more

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.070 
maybe the Super Robot really is more
than<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.190> machine

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080
