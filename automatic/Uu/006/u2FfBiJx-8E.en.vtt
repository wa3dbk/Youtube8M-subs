00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
colors that they do show is it their

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.449 
colors that they do show is it their
direct<00:02:41.319> guys<00:02:41.500> they<00:02:41.680> sit<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.099> hair<00:02:42.280> and

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
direct guys they sit on the hair and

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.020 
direct guys they sit on the hair and
then<00:02:42.790> they<00:02:42.910> want<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.670> artificial<00:02:45.670> occur

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
then they want to it so artificial occur

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.430 
then they want to it so artificial occur

do is your going to shampoo the hair and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.080 
do is your going to shampoo the hair and
then<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.159> apply<00:02:59.310> its<00:02:59.519> freshly<00:02:59.790> shampooed

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
then you apply its freshly shampooed

sulfate free shampoo the press box and

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.640 
sulfate free shampoo the press box and
you<00:03:41.609> can<00:03:41.639> share<00:03:41.939> for<00:03:42.090> more<00:03:42.209> than<00:03:42.329> one<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
you can share for more than one then you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.280 
you can share for more than one then you
can<00:03:43.769> do<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:43.919> 10<00:03:44.159> volume<00:03:44.489> shackle<00:03:44.909> just

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
can do a 10 volume shackle just

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.600 
can do a 10 volume shackle just
just<00:03:45.469> running<00:03:45.650> 10<00:03:45.890> volume<00:03:46.189> through<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.400> hair

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
just running 10 volume through the hair

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.190 
just running 10 volume through the hair
and<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:46.909> reason<00:03:47.569> for<00:03:47.599> that<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.870> what<00:03:49.959> right<00:03:50.959> so

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
and the reason for that is what right so

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.179 
and the reason for that is what right so
what<00:03:51.319> will<00:03:51.409> happen<00:03:51.439> is<00:03:51.739> if<00:03:51.890> they're<00:03:52.010> still

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
what will happen is if they're still

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.890 
what will happen is if they're still
coming<00:03:52.370> home<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:52.969> there<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.269> 10<00:03:53.510> volume

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
coming home so in there that 10 volume

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.970 
coming home so in there that 10 volume
will<00:03:54.079> marry<00:03:54.500> back<00:03:54.769> up<00:04:02.140> 10<00:04:03.140> what<00:04:03.620> happens<00:04:03.890> when

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
will marry back up 10 what happens when

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.800 
will marry back up 10 what happens when
you<00:04:04.069> do<00:04:04.189> the<00:04:04.340> 10<00:04:04.519> million<00:04:04.730> check<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.720> the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
you do the 10 million check is that the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.780 
you do the 10 million check is that the
10<00:04:05.989> volume<00:04:06.319> will<00:04:06.470> marry<00:04:06.739> back<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.519> color

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
10 volume will marry back to the color

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.750 
10 volume will marry back to the color
lab<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.859> then<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.189> will<00:04:13.280> give<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:13.730> a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
lab and then that will give you like a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.699 
lab and then that will give you like a
safety<00:04:14.120> precaution<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.049> know<00:04:15.139> if<00:04:15.409> you<00:04:15.560> need

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
safety precaution I you know if you need

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.979 
safety precaution I you know if you need
to<00:04:15.859> reapply<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.060> reapply<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.840> know<00:04:17.959> I

to reapply you can reapply you know I

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.270 
to reapply you can reapply you know I
would<00:04:18.289> tell<00:04:18.500> people<00:04:18.680> when<00:04:19.039> they're<00:04:19.160> little

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
would tell people when they're little

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
bit nervous would usually when you get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.659 
bit nervous would usually when you get
something<00:04:21.049> extractor<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:21.979> semi<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.460> laws
