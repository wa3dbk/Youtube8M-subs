to harvest the worm composter for the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.080 
to harvest the worm composter for the
first<00:00:15.980> time<00:00:16.219> as<00:00:16.400> you've<00:00:16.550> probably<00:00:16.760> seen

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
before I've got a stackable worm

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.350 
before I've got a stackable worm
composter<00:00:19.640> there<00:00:19.790> like<00:00:20.029> a<00:00:20.060> bunch<00:00:20.240> of

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
composter there like a bunch of

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.050 
composter there like a bunch of
different<00:00:20.480> stacks<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.700> the<00:00:22.700> one<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:22.970> I'm

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
different stacks and the one that I'm

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.550 
different stacks and the one that I'm
going<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.240> harvest<00:00:23.599> which<00:00:23.840> is<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.200> stuff<00:00:24.380> down

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
going to harvest which is the stuff down

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.590 
going to harvest which is the stuff down
here<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.340> actually<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.850> stuff<00:00:26.060> that<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:26.270> put<00:00:26.480> in

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
here is actually the stuff that I put in

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.840 
here is actually the stuff that I put in
the<00:00:26.720> first<00:00:26.869> time<00:00:27.170> I<00:00:27.199> went<00:00:28.100> it<00:00:28.220> when<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:28.610> first

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
the first time I went it when I first

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.550 
the first time I went it when I first
started<00:00:29.180> it<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:29.539> probably<00:00:29.690> like<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:30.230> don't

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
started it so it's probably like I don't

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.130 
started it so it's probably like I don't
know<00:00:30.770> four<00:00:31.760> or<00:00:31.789> five<00:00:31.970> months<00:00:32.239> old<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:32.750> the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
know four or five months old now so the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.180 
know four or five months old now so the
first<00:00:33.320> thing<00:00:33.470> I'm<00:00:33.559> going<00:00:33.650> to<00:00:33.710> do<00:00:33.830> is<00:00:33.980> see<00:00:34.129> if

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
first thing I'm going to do is see if

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.530 
first thing I'm going to do is see if
there's<00:00:34.340> any<00:00:34.460> worm<00:00:34.699> tea<00:00:34.940> in<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.180> bottom<00:00:35.449> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
there's any worm tea in the bottom the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.790 
there's any worm tea in the bottom the
warm<00:00:35.660> tea<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.230> water<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.620> comes

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
warm tea is like the water that comes

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.890 
warm tea is like the water that comes
through<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.190> hangs<00:00:37.340> out<00:00:37.460> at<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.670> bottom<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.420> I

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
through and hangs out at the bottom so I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.110 
through and hangs out at the bottom so I
don't<00:00:39.800> know<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.100> took<00:00:40.340> some<00:00:40.580> out<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.699> while<00:00:40.879> ago

try<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.569> get<00:02:08.720> away<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.940> let<00:02:10.940> me<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.150> think

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
try to get away so let me just think

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.890 
try to get away so let me just think
about<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.660> before<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:11.989> go<00:02:13.420> there<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.540> go

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.850 

and<00:02:18.569> there's<00:02:19.569> some<00:02:19.750> or<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.080> original<00:02:20.650> paper

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and there's some or the original paper

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.710 
and there's some or the original paper
that<00:02:21.010> obviously<00:02:21.489> didn't<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.819> cut<00:02:22.299> up<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.629> I'm

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
that obviously didn't get cut up and I'm

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.850 
that obviously didn't get cut up and I'm
just<00:02:22.750> gonna<00:02:22.959> throw<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.680> because

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
just gonna throw that in there because

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.849 
is all worm castings or worm poop and
truthfully<00:02:49.510> considering<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:52.859> food

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
truthfully considering that this is food

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.020 
truthfully considering that this is food
that's<00:02:54.099> been<00:02:54.250> sitting<00:02:54.430> here<00:02:54.549> for<00:02:54.760> three<00:02:54.879> to

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
that's been sitting here for three to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.059 
that's been sitting here for three to
five<00:02:55.150> months<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:56.379> actually<00:02:56.680> doesn't<00:02:56.829> smell

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
five months it actually doesn't smell

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.349 
five months it actually doesn't smell
that<00:02:57.250> bad<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.700> got<00:02:57.879> a<00:02:57.910> little<00:02:58.060> bit<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.299> a

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
that bad it's got a little bit of a

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.059 
that bad it's got a little bit of a
smell<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.829> not<00:02:59.980> too<00:03:00.190> bad

smell it's not too bad

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.960 
smell it's not too bad
so<00:03:03.069> basically<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.459> think<00:03:03.519> what<00:03:03.730> I'm<00:03:03.819> going<00:03:03.909> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
so basically I think what I'm going to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.699 
so basically I think what I'm going to
do<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:05.099> pop<00:03:06.099> this<00:03:06.310> over<00:03:06.519> here<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
do is pop this over here and then as I

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.990 
do is pop this over here and then as I
go<00:03:08.859> through<00:03:08.890> stuff<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.400> get<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.640> worms<00:03:09.790> out

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
go through stuff and get the worms out

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.520 
go through stuff and get the worms out
and<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.329> mean<00:03:10.569> truthfully<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:11.290> don't<00:03:11.440> get

and I mean truthfully if you don't get
all<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> worms<00:03:11.859> out<00:03:12.069> it's<00:03:12.220> not<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> end<00:03:12.609> of

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.619 
all the worms out it's not the end of
the<00:03:12.760> world<00:03:12.909> because<00:03:13.180> they're<00:03:13.299> just<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.540> to

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
the world because they're just going to

and I keep them in there or they're

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.720 
and I keep them in there or they're
happy<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.849> they<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:19.180> their<00:03:19.269> job<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:21.579> can
