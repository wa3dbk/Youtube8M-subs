00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.010
 I greet all the brave little tailor 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.600
 decided to watch that video or 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.730
 refueling to led to 1 sewing line 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.700
 start off with the top looper 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.530
 and so open the lid on the right by turning 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.870
 flywheel 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.580
 needles and the top loop of these cite 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.490
 lower position and push the lever 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:46.570
 looper off 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:50.560
 here is yourself here and again the view of the river 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:56.150
 lever off 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.750
 then you need to remove a lot but for that not 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.410
 in that it should only be lifted 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.630
 top knife lever 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.960
 this should be done with the lid open 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:14.170
 right and lowered and third or 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.680
 so that the knife does not hook him and so 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 raise the knife itself pulling up the lever 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.990
 and rotate the whole mechanism 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:35.420
 clicking then we will return it by pressing 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.850
 but this and once again here this 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.549
 lever 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.890
 when our selected installs 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.760
 special platform for times 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.619
 sewing stitch is a fixture 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.229
 will allow to close the broken nose and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.490
 extend the work surface to the right of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.210
 needles 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.280
 I install the platform open the lid 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 looper 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.620
 right and shoot as we call 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:15.370
 protection clicking then holding the platform 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.010
 we install it parallel to the cover 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.190
 pushing to the right. 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.060
 and very simple mancer 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.000
 change your foot on a special boat 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.080
 changing in modern overlock also 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.239
 as in ordinary sewing machines 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.739
 pushing the lever behind the bench holder 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:51.019
 and vodka is asked to deliver the right 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:54.980
 and lower everything more precisely with the foot all and we 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.049
 the qibla must have ceased to grow jokes in 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.440
 my coverlock I stipulated 3 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:06.370
 holes here they are and I install two 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.560
 extreme needles 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 but you can install all three needles 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.200
 we pass refuel a certain 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.730
 refueling is not the type of loop those performing 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.480
 the pattern drawn under the left cover 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.470
 Look at my great site 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.579
 study this scheme yourself and 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.459
 translate if in the lower position and I 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:40.090
 tell you what to do next and about 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:46.120
 that is not drawn on this diagram and 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.819
 there do not cling not to this guide he 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.739
 intended only for performance 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:58.000
 chain stitch and to drink 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.010
 looper your boat needs to be lowered 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.420
 tanker lever a 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:09.739
 so calls it produced but we somehow 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.409
 know the truth really is no 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.890
 not a tanker 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.380
 just a little white little lever 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.169
 who makes loops of tees 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.320
 affordable when the times ruler in 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:29.050
 hole letter Tilla and lift it 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.050
 you see a tag under the bench 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.760
 needle people we fill strictly according 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:49.250
 this is simple and therefore we will not 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:52.440
 stop and that's it for today 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.100
 setting once the sewing stitch next 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.100
 video clip . 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.360
 you still want to buy a carpet but then 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.440
 you will have to watch it again
