monks in this cell here in in dunster I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.330 
monks in this cell here in in dunster I

got a bed early but they get up early
right<00:00:09.440> they<00:00:10.440> said<00:00:10.620> there<00:00:10.769> must<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.980> some<00:00:11.130> way

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
right they said there must be some way

for<00:00:11.280> them<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> sleep<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:13.320> chances<00:00:13.769> are

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
for them to sleep and the chances are

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.269 
for them to sleep and the chances are
it's<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.639> some<00:00:15.059> sort<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> dormitory<00:00:16.049> with

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's it's some sort of dormitory with

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.179 
it's it's some sort of dormitory with
you<00:00:17.279> know<00:00:17.430> three<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:17.730> four<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.150> five<00:00:18.180> beds<00:00:19.189> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
you know three or four or five beds and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
you know three or four or five beds and
the<00:00:20.310> somewhere<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.760> them<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> eat<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:22.109> they

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the somewhere for them to eat and they

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.400 
the somewhere for them to eat and they
only<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.750> one<00:00:24.750> meal<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
only really have one one meal and a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
only really have one one meal and a
snack<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> day<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.000> not<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> big

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
snack a day really so it's not a big

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380 
snack a day really so it's not a big
deal<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.250> for<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.210> would<00:00:30.300> be

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
deal and for all we know and it would be

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
deal and for all we know and it would be
quite<00:00:30.599> likely<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.500> Benedictines

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
quite likely I think with Benedictines

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
quite likely I think with Benedictines
there<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.610> servants<00:00:33.329> who<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
there would be servants who would do the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
there would be servants who would do the
cooking<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> looking<00:00:36.210> after<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> place<00:00:38.360> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
cooking and looking after the place but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
cooking and looking after the place but
they'd<00:00:39.540> spend<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.410> doing<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
they'd spend a lot of time doing that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.090 
they'd spend a lot of time doing that
but<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:42.770> isolated<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but because they are isolated from the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.549 
but because they are isolated from the
main<00:00:44.280> house<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.820> bath<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.899> they

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
main house in bath because they they

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.880 
main house in bath because they they
appear<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> farm<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.149> then

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
appear to have a farm with them then

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
appear to have a farm with them then
supervising<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.489> workers<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.180> estate

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
supervising the workers on the estate

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
supervising the workers on the estate
that<00:00:51.719> those<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> lay<00:00:52.500> people<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> estate

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that those the lay people on the estate

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
that those the lay people on the estate
and<00:00:53.820> making<00:00:54.180> sure<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.379> farming's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and making sure that the the farming's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.819 
and making sure that the the farming's
done<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:57.149> probably<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> big<00:00:58.320> part<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
done would probably be a big part of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.400 
done would probably be a big part of the
day<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.079> likely

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
day as well so do you think it's likely

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.750 
day as well so do you think it's likely
that<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.680> prior<00:01:01.949> might<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.340> lifting<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that the prior might are lifting this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
that the prior might are lifting this
building<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
building here you can see it in the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.250 
building here you can see it in the
photograph<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.600> yeah<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> can't<00:01:07.049> tell

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
photograph here yeah but you can't tell

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899 
photograph here yeah but you can't tell
what<00:01:07.470> age<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> windows

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
what age this is because the windows

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.539 
what age this is because the windows
aren't<00:01:09.210> original<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.100> mean<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.220> looks<00:01:11.400> like

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
aren't original I mean that looks like

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
aren't original I mean that looks like
modern<00:01:11.880> windows<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> fact<00:01:12.659> you've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> get

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
modern windows in fact you've got to get

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.620 
modern windows in fact you've got to get
inside<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.740> getting<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> roof<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
inside it getting the roof look at it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.890 
inside it getting the roof look at it
but<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.650> sort<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> position

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
but that's the right sort of position

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
but that's the right sort of position
for<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> priors<00:01:19.500> lodging<00:01:20.130> close<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> church

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
for a priors lodging close to the church

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
for a priors lodging close to the church
close<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> church<00:01:22.409> probably<00:01:22.799> even<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> doorway

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
close to church probably even a doorway

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.300 
close to church probably even a doorway
into<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.970> church<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.250> know

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
into the church from it but you know

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
into the church from it but you know
there<00:01:26.610> aren't<00:01:26.759> many<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.810> mean<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there aren't many of them I mean you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
there aren't many of them I mean you
hardly<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.490> live<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> separate

hardly think they live in a separate
