00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now the problem is so the dollar is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
now the problem is so the dollar is
going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> keep<00:01:00.120> dropping<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> one

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
going to keep dropping so will the one

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
going to keep dropping so will the one
of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> reasons<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.600> predict<00:01:03.600> what's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
of the reasons I can predict what's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
of the reasons I can predict what's
going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> happen<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.100> predict<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
going to happen is I can predict the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
going to happen is I can predict the
dollar<00:01:05.939> will<00:01:06.210> keep<00:01:06.420> dropping<00:01:06.990> simply<00:01:07.409> because

the reason this current election doesn't
make<00:01:29.220> any<00:01:29.490> difference<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.299> person

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
