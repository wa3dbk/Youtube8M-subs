 kitchen of flavor right be here I am 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.250

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.349
 Ã¡lex and they would like it again then talk 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.180
 of a product that you are already familiar with 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.210
 of a little while ago it's called 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.710
 the fly break with me and pinging this 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.720
 product what we 're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.540
 compose a cake that is very easy to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.480
 do using a little bit of candy or 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.790
 a little bit of milk candy and using 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.739
 good fresh fruit let's start 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.000
 when we will begin what 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.100
 we want to do is to ensure that always 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.430
 be at second speed and what 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.430
 we learn 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.210
 well now that we have already beaten our burning 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.350
 to the point that he told us we are going what 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.540
 let's do is let's fill 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.180
 our cake and decorate it we are going to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.180
 first put it to the sleeve 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.260
 a little whipped cream and leave it here 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.760
 on the side while we're going to fill in the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.760
 cake with a bit of caramel sauce 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.260
 continuing with the same sleeve that we are going 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.330
 to fill 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 let's line the cake around 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.260
 from bottom to top 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.710
 Now what we 're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.640
 use our sleeve and our help 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.500
 wide of types for flower and what we're going 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.380
 to do is we are going to line the cake 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 around going from the center towards 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.490
 outside 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.490
 and the bottom edge 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 using a bit of 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.400
 cinnamon powder 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.159
 and we want to just put a little bit the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.110
 sign to show our design 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.970
