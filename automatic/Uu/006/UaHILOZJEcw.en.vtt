going to take off the plant from its
original<00:00:34.170> path

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.200 

in<00:01:38.950> when<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.850> report<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.450> plant<00:01:40.720> we<00:01:41.260> need<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
in when you report a plant we need this

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.710 
in when you report a plant we need this
river<00:01:44.020> sand<00:01:44.580> for<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.700> drainage<00:01:45.970> system<00:01:46.120> of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
river sand for the drainage system of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.850 
river sand for the drainage system of
the<00:01:46.840> pot<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:48.490> also<00:01:48.760> need<00:01:49.830> good<00:01:50.830> soil<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
the pot we also need good soil the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.960 
the pot we also need good soil the
composition<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.700> one-third<00:01:55.740> sand<00:01:56.970> one-third

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.930 

an<00:02:52.380> oval<00:02:53.040> shape<00:02:53.340> pad<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> rectangular<00:02:55.500> pad

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
an oval shape pad or a rectangular pad

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.410 
an oval shape pad or a rectangular pad
you<00:02:56.940> should<00:02:57.210> put<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> plant<00:02:58.670> off-center<00:02:59.670> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you should put the plant off-center that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.320 
you should put the plant off-center that
means<00:03:00.770> one<00:03:01.770> side<00:03:01.800> should<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.700> more<00:03:02.940> space

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
means one side should have more space

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.160 
means one side should have more space
than<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.260> other<00:03:04.440> side<00:03:05.630> we<00:03:06.630> should<00:03:06.870> buy<00:03:07.110> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
than the other side we should buy the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.400 
than the other side we should buy the
root<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.520> there<00:03:09.300> won't<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.600> any<00:03:09.990> movement

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
root so that there won't be any movement

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:35.400 
root so that there won't be any movement
from<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.800> plant

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.800 

after<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.460> typed<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.910> words<00:03:37.240> from<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
after you have typed the words from the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.880 
after you have typed the words from the
roots<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:39.100> now<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:40.390> are<00:03:40.570> now<00:03:40.810> ready<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
roots we now we are now ready for the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.520 
roots we now we are now ready for the
topsoil<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.580> we<00:03:42.910> are<00:03:42.970> going<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.300> use<00:03:43.480> for<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
topsoil that we are going to use for the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:04:35.920 
topsoil that we are going to use for the
plan

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.920 

now<00:04:36.930> using<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.379> chopstick<00:04:38.029> you<00:04:39.029> should<00:04:39.360> insert

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
now using a chopstick you should insert

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.879 
now using a chopstick you should insert
it<00:04:40.189> so<00:04:41.189> that<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.909> soil<00:04:42.210> would<00:04:43.050> properly<00:04:43.649> go

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
it so that the soil would properly go

00:04:43.889 --> 00:05:07.610 
it so that the soil would properly go
down

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.860 

start<00:05:08.620> putting<00:05:08.800> all<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.250> soil<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:10.240> make<00:05:10.630> sure

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
start putting all the soil you make sure

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.670 
start putting all the soil you make sure
that<00:05:11.169> there<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:11.650> a<00:05:11.680> space<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.569> side<00:05:13.810> it

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
that there is a space on the side it

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.900 
that there is a space on the side it
doesn't<00:05:14.979> matter<00:05:15.400> if<00:05:15.819> you<00:05:16.289> elevate<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.530> plant

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
doesn't matter if you elevate the plant

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.260 
doesn't matter if you elevate the plant
so<00:05:18.910> long<00:05:19.090> as<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.500> put<00:05:20.500> a<00:05:20.560> space<00:05:20.949> so<00:05:21.910> that<00:05:21.940> when

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
so long as you put a space so that when

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.129 
so long as you put a space so that when
you<00:05:22.389> water<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.990> plant<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:24.130> would<00:05:24.840> know<00:05:25.840> that

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
you water the plant you would know that

00:05:26.139 --> 00:06:23.580 
you water the plant you would know that
it<00:05:26.710> could<00:05:26.979> contain<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.520> water<00:05:27.789> inside

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.810 

after<00:06:24.590> putting<00:06:24.830> all<00:06:25.280> the<00:06:26.140> moss<00:06:27.280> we<00:06:28.280> have<00:06:28.520> to

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
after putting all the moss we have to

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.290 
after putting all the moss we have to
finally<00:06:29.360> water<00:06:29.780> the<00:06:30.050> plan
