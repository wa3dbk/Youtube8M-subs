week

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.240 

I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.140> belt<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.620> great<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.130> all

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I think it's the belt is great for all

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.530 
I think it's the belt is great for all
ages<00:02:27.710> at<00:02:28.710> all<00:02:28.950> levels

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
ages at all levels

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020 
ages at all levels
you<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.410> Broncos<00:02:31.860> made<00:02:32.040> great<00:02:32.280> strides<00:02:32.490> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you know Broncos made great strides and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.780 
you know Broncos made great strides and
you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:33.990> adjusting<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.800> size<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.370> belts<00:02:35.700> in

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you know adjusting the size of belts in

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.780 
you know adjusting the size of belts in
terms<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.180> weight<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> mill<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.550> hold

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
terms of weight what the mill can hold

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.460 
terms of weight what the mill can hold
so<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.600> say<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:39.930> ages<00:02:40.320> would

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
so you know I would say all ages would

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.970 
so you know I would say all ages would
benefit<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.100> belt<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.490> sure

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.040
