00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.920
 we have the exhibition in about 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.470
 divided into eight chapters it's about 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.270
 to show the whole life of rubens 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.000
 So starting with the early work 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.280
 who did, for example, in italy 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 to his last works one 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.960
 landscape about the last 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.120
 has created years of life in between 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 we have individual chapters dealing with 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.430
 the different spheres of influence 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.670
 thus employ church nobility bourgeoisie 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.290
 and we have some of his 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.810
 diplomatic adventure is trying one 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.239
 bit to reconstruct specifically 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.180
 For example, a room that deals with the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.060
 Medici cycle busy in Paris or 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.509
 a room that deals with the English 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.580
 diplomatic adventure 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.740
 dealt with in the last weeks 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.330
 we have the rooms here first 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.340
 be prepared large partition walls 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.270
 I was built a big blanket 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.790
 moved in 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.040
 And now there are big boxes every day 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.899
 then we come to unpack here 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.030
 the pictures from the boxes on this 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.920
 big tables and will be there first 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.450
 examined one must first see if 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.580
 hopefully nothing on the transport 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.709
 happened and then the first 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.360
 pictures hung romance is not only 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.069
 one of the most famous painters in the world 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.170
 is also one of the most expensive painters of the 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.479
 a few years ago, for example, is world 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.550
 a picture surfaced on the 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.340
 art market and was then auctioned 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.920
 that has at least 120 million dollars 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.539
 At that time cost was then belief 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.929
 I the most expensive picture in the world or something 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.240
 something 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.709
 Of course, these are hardly on the map 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.590
 art market and that's why we can 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.340
 our exhibition is not really accurate 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.289
 estimate 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.970
 you can not do that but they are 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.970
 very precious things we here 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.290
 we are standing here in the courtyard of the house 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.600
 right here his home is right 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.970
 a studio building that he after the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.670
 state-of-the-art knowledge built at that time 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.980
 It has a typical baroque construction and this one 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.200
 Both buildings are connected by one 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.670
 Arcades row through the one in the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.370
 garden can look into it 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.700
 So that's the receiving room, so to speak 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.990
 the rubens house where every visitor first 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.800
 Come on in and we wanted it here 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.230
 also show 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.700
 we also see here how 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.680
 lordly lived the above 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.320
 was not a normal but that was a 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.450
 rich very very wealthy man of 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.400
 House from already and through his painting 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.930
 he has become even wealthier here 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 in this picture we see maria di 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.050
 medici up eg as a crown has the maria 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.600
 de medici a building on so man 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.000
 could almost mean that a fortification 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.590
 maybe even the bastille one could 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 but now say that is the defensive 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.210
 france if you like it but basti 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.420
 then it could also mean the prison 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.370
 His Rome liked to paint big for the nobility 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.650
 hunt pieces that it's one of them 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.680
 boar hunt you see there comes from 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.600
 on the right a hound and a hunter 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.880
 a horse and dare this wild boar 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.980
 and on the left this becomes 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.380
 wild boar hunted by four 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.390
 help and the foremost one has now 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.820
 really crazy pitch because its 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.190
 spear be spies broken off 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.440
 and there you see the whole thing 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.350
 championship of rubens during the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.090
 other hunting assistants I rotwang and 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.480
 chubby are actually shown 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.600
 this is a challenging hunter from the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.450
 horrified that drawn him now 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.550
 infested because he is defenseless without his 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.080
 spit and sees how he suddenly pale 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.190
 how the lips turn into blue 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.959
 discolour into 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.080
 he is already almost dead 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.080
 man
