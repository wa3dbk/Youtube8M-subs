00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.840
 how about friends of youtube today I come to 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.330
 tell them about the advantage of being 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.219
 premium and did not reward this video is not 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.919
 to tell them which of the two types of 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.589
 minecraft is better but see the advantages 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.840
 of each one I have used the two types of 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.060
 minecraft and I want to tell you that both 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.190
 they are the same only with a few 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.190
 differences and let's start 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.700
 a player 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.580
 Being premium is for notorious when you create 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.200
 online since you have more benefits but 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.180
 if you only like to play minecraft in 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.370
 lonely I recommend that you do not 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 buy because in that case the premium and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.500
 no premium is the same 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.540
 the the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.610
 if you are premium the mac craft has a 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.070
 better performance because they contain the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.380
 original files with time are going 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.260
 improving or updating to remove the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.750
 mistakes of the game however if you're not 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.000
 premium there are mods for example the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.640
 horti fair that gives you the benefit of 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 improve the performance of the dance or if 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 you have a good computer in the no 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.440
 it will be a problem 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 the nyt 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.520
 when you buy the minecraft alone 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.050
 you will have the opportunity to put a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.710
 Name your account no longer can 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.930
 change it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.300
 it has to be unique that name was 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 registered in Moya for life 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.350
 be non-premium you have the opportunity to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.890
 Change your name or nick number of times 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.520
 want without any restriction 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 the launcher 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 When you buy craft your account is digital 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 in motion and only by logging in 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.500
 minecraft together with your purchased account 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.210
 you can download the original launcher 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 of minecraft as many times as you want and in 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.270
 the computers you want in the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.460
 original launcher can only be entered 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.840
 with a premium account is the launcher you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.850
 provides all versions of minecraft 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.159
 and it is updated with time for a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.590
 better quality of the game's top losers 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.780
 premiums are not as efficient there are 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.060
 some who only have one version of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.069
 minecraft but now the jons have gone 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.380
 that are updatable and very efficient 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.920
 as the original launcher for example the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.750
 launcher team extreme or youtubers 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.759
 known 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.519
 almost all known youtubers are 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.260
 premium or rather all of them tend to 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.269
 play on premium servers and if you want 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.940
 know them or show up some their videos 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.769
 the only option is to be premium 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.720
 if you are not premium and you do not consider yourself a 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.940
 fan of the youtubers and you are only interested 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.100
 I liked the gameplay because it is not 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.040
 need to be premium 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.540
 the bots 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.459
 for those who have the sea craft 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 purchased there is a variety of motorcycles 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.939
 Father mods that can be downloaded 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.650
 entering in your premium account those 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.359
 motorcycles usually have no errors and there are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.859
 others that modify the client or that 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.200
 modify your skin for example 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.909
 provide a layer for non-premium 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.900
 there are thousands of motorcycles to collect that 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.650
 you can download it from the internet 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.930
 being many very good and complex 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.489
 the servers 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.349
 those who have the accounts will charge 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.000
 can enter any server and 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.590
 even more to the best servers that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 they have very good games and a good 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.370
 performance which they only allow 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.230
 prizes but to achieve a prize 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.000
 there are thousands of servers with games 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.140
 very good or equal to those of videos 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.640
 the only thing would be just looking for them 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.680
 the skin 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 usually people with asthma and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 krafft for getting his own skin it 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.590
 can they make an internet there is a 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.209
 immense variety of skins when playing 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 online, other people can see your 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.560
 skin there are skins of your character 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.970
 favorite or some very good calling 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.770
 the attention of other users 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.570
 the skin is more tantalian when playing 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.640
 minecraft online in the pirates there 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.440
 some way to get a skin but 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.690
 it will only be seen by you and the others 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.010
 people will see it as steve but 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.750
 Remember how important it is to play 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 minecraft not that other people you 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.260
 see as a certain skin also a 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.960
 skin does not make you a better player in 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.500
 Minecraft 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.480
 your own server to be premium you have 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.250
 access to enter affiliates that are the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.170
 better machine servers because 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.330
 those servers belong to mocha and you go 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.130
 to be able to rent and play with friends for 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.900
 the non-premium there are several ways to 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.240
 play with a friend like for example 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.130
 hamÃ¡s and that is free and you can spend 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.020
 a fun afternoon playing online between 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.890
 friends 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.130
 the cost 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.870
 to be such a successful and very good game 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.760
 as a way to give them a

 thanks to the creators of the game 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.600
 would be buying them the main craft
