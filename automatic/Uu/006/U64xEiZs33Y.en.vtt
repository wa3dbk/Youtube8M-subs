00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
and I guess this is our next best one
and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> hacka<00:01:02.250> -<00:01:02.579> oh<00:01:02.899> boy<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.290> a

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
now which that would be a terrible

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:38.360 
now which that would be a terrible
terrible<00:05:27.360> decision<00:05:36.800> don't<00:05:37.800> think<00:05:38.130> if<00:05:38.250> I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
terrible decision don't think if I

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.990 
terrible decision don't think if I
should<00:05:38.580> send<00:05:38.789> this<00:05:38.970> guy<00:05:39.210> into<00:05:39.240> battle<00:05:39.990> or<00:05:40.169> in<00:05:40.199> -

no probably not

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.779 
no probably not
in<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.500> training<00:05:44.010> he<00:05:44.340> doesn't<00:05:44.669> look<00:05:44.729> that

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
in the training he doesn't look that

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.939 
in the training he doesn't look that
strong<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.630> mean<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.139> Boneknapper

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
strong I mean the Boneknapper

strong I mean the Boneknapper
it's<00:05:47.490> really<00:05:47.760> much<00:05:47.940> stronger<00:05:48.389> I'm<00:05:49.289> gonna<00:05:49.560> sit

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
it's really much stronger I'm gonna sit

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.770 
it's really much stronger I'm gonna sit
on<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.010> Boneknapper<00:05:50.220> in<00:05:50.789> the<00:05:50.909> training<00:05:51.360> and

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
on the Boneknapper in the training and

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.110 
on the Boneknapper in the training and
the<00:05:52.620> academy<00:05:53.070> all<00:05:53.250> right<00:05:53.370> our<00:05:53.550> academy<00:05:54.000> is

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
the academy all right our academy is

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.600 
the academy all right our academy is
busy<00:05:54.539> we<00:05:54.810> don't<00:05:54.840> have<00:05:55.080> enough<00:05:55.289> space<00:05:55.610> let's

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
busy we don't have enough space let's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:06.200 
busy we don't have enough space let's
send<00:05:56.849> him<00:05:57.060> out<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.539> search<00:05:57.960> for<00:05:57.990> wood<00:05:58.590> then<00:06:05.210> all

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
send him out to search for wood then all

send him out to search for wood then all
right<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.360> guess<00:06:06.630> we're<00:06:06.870> forced<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.440> send<00:06:07.650> him

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
right I guess we're forced to send him

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.279 
right I guess we're forced to send him
out<00:06:08.010> into<00:06:08.300> Titan<00:06:09.300> training<00:06:09.720> than<00:06:09.870> six<00:06:10.110> hours

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
but anyways that is pretty much that is

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.770 
but anyways that is pretty much that is
fleet<00:06:13.560> 10<00:06:13.979> and<00:06:14.250> we<00:06:14.370> sent<00:06:14.669> out<00:06:14.849> our<00:06:15.000> Night<00:06:15.419> Fury

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
which has basically allowed us to beat

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.959 
which has basically allowed us to beat

Alvin the chipmunk in the game so far
and<00:06:27.029> I<00:06:28.099> guess<00:06:29.099> we're<00:06:29.279> on<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.520> second<00:06:29.940> battle

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
and I guess we're on the second battle

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.180 
and I guess we're on the second battle
the<00:06:30.360> 11th

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
the 11th

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.650 
the 11th
battle<00:06:31.610> and<00:06:31.730> you<00:06:31.820> see<00:06:32.000> as<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.240> can<00:06:32.390> see<00:06:32.540> the

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
battle and you see as you can see the

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.020 
battle and you see as you can see the
11th<00:06:33.080> battle<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.800> turned<00:06:34.070> from<00:06:34.130> bronze<00:06:34.610> into

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.910 
11th battle it turned from bronze into
silver<00:06:35.600> I<00:06:35.630> guess<00:06:35.870> is<00:06:35.990> gonna<00:06:36.140> turn<00:06:36.380> into<00:06:36.440> gold

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
silver I guess is gonna turn into gold

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.770 
silver I guess is gonna turn into gold
and<00:06:37.160> the<00:06:37.280> platinum<00:06:37.880> and<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.090> rhodium<00:06:38.660> or
