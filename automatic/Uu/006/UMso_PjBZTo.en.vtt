sticks<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> panel<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
sticks to the panel so you don't have to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
sticks to the panel so you don't have to
worry<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:16.920> taping<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> hope<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
worry about taping it and hope that the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.039 
worry about taping it and hope that the
tape<00:01:18.990> doesn't<00:01:19.920> move<00:01:20.250> while<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.670> cutting

tape doesn't move while you're cutting
these<00:01:22.049> guys<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.590> thought<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.979> everything

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
these guys have thought of everything

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
these guys have thought of everything
well<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> most<00:01:25.860> time-consuming<00:01:26.250> part<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
well the most time-consuming part of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.050 
well the most time-consuming part of
this<00:01:27.570> install<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.740> running<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> transducer

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this install was running the transducer

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.810 
this install was running the transducer
cable<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> bow<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> cockpit<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
cable from the bow to the cockpit and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319 
cable from the bow to the cockpit and
that<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.689> wasn't<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.170> difficult<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:35.329> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that really wasn't that difficult as I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
that really wasn't that difficult as I
have<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> tiller<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:37.140> close<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> bulkhead

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
have a tiller I'm close to the bulkhead

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
have a tiller I'm close to the bulkhead
so<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> mounted<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so I mounted it right up here on the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.179 
so I mounted it right up here on the
swivel<00:01:41.130> rather<00:01:41.549> than<00:01:41.930> inside<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> also<00:01:43.979> be

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
swivel rather than inside it can also be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
swivel rather than inside it can also be
flush<00:01:44.729> mounted<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.600> may<00:01:45.840> require<00:01:46.259> an

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
flush mounted which may require an

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.600 
flush mounted which may require an
external<00:01:46.799> GPS<00:01:47.399> receiver<00:01:49.130> well<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> left<00:01:50.369> some

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
external GPS receiver well I left some

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.719 
external GPS receiver well I left some
extra<00:01:50.970> power<00:01:51.180> cord<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.610> I'm

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
extra power cord here so that when I'm

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209 
extra power cord here so that when I'm
working<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> programming<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.979> sit<00:01:56.189> right

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
working on programming I can sit right

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.010 
working on programming I can sit right
here<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.509> stand<00:01:57.719> up

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
here and do it I don't have to stand up

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.390 
here and do it I don't have to stand up
and<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
and do it

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.630 
and do it
and<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:02.040> charts<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.520> are

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and at this time the charts that are

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.720 
and at this time the charts that are
built<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.360> they're<00:02:04.370> more<00:02:05.370> sufficient

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
built into this they're more sufficient

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.540 
built into this they're more sufficient
than<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.180> need<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:07.170> may<00:02:07.470> get<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.950> map<00:02:08.190> chip

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
than I need but I may get a see map chip

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.340 
than I need but I may get a see map chip
a<00:02:08.760> little<00:02:09.180> bit<00:02:09.270> later<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.960> for<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> little

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
a little bit later you know for a little

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.150 
a little bit later you know for a little
more<00:02:10.470> detail

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
more detail

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and we'll get into the operations in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.680 
and we'll get into the operations in
several<00:02:20.010> other<00:02:20.130> videos<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:21.180> let's<00:02:21.420> talk

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
several other videos but let's talk

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.040 
several other videos but let's talk
about<00:02:21.870> installing<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> unit<00:02:23.660> well<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> first

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
about installing the unit well the first

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.720 
about installing the unit well the first
thing<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.380> did<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> install<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
thing I did was to install the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.840 
thing I did was to install the
transducer<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.770> also<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.280> an<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.610> Hull

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
transducer you can also get an in Hull

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.430 
transducer you can also get an in Hull
transducer<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.780> what<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.110> kind<00:02:31.380> of

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
transducer you know what it just kind of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.280 
transducer you know what it just kind of
sticks<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.070> there<00:02:32.340> however<00:02:33.030> since<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.990> already

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
sticks in there however since I already

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.190 
sticks in there however since I already
had<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> transducer<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.730> boat<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
had a transducer on this boat but it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530 
had a transducer on this boat but it
didn't<00:02:37.440> work<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.940> went<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> through-hole

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
didn't work I went for the through-hole

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.110 
didn't work I went for the through-hole
type<00:02:40.050> now<00:02:40.620> there's<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> suggestion<00:02:41.430> guide<00:02:41.820> with

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
type now there's a suggestion guide with

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
type now there's a suggestion guide with
the<00:02:42.150> transducer<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.410> where<00:02:43.740> some<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the transducer as to where some of the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.630 
the transducer as to where some of the
optimum<00:02:45.210> places<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.900> place<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.430> mine<00:02:47.430> was

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
optimum places to place it mine was

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.780 
optimum places to place it mine was
already<00:02:47.850> picked<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> great<00:02:49.080> place

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
already picked and it was a great place

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.480 
already picked and it was a great place
sorry<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.850> already<00:02:51.240> tossed<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.750> out<00:02:51.810> though

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
sorry I already tossed that out though

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.090 
sorry I already tossed that out though
now<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.520> had<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> yard<00:02:54.120> haul<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.810> boat<00:02:55.100> needed

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
now I had the yard haul the boat needed

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.520 
now I had the yard haul the boat needed
a<00:02:56.220> good<00:02:56.370> prop<00:02:56.670> cleaning<00:02:57.120> anyway<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.380> old

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
a good prop cleaning anyway and the old

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.570 
a good prop cleaning anyway and the old
transducer<00:02:59.310> came<00:02:59.520> out<00:02:59.730> very<00:03:00.240> easy

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.010 

however<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.700> had<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.030> do<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> little<00:03:08.390> work<00:03:08.690> in

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
however I had to do a little work in

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:18.400 
however I had to do a little work in
getting<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.709> whole<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.550> right<00:03:10.790> size

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.190 

now<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.070> used<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.550> high-strength<00:03:20.240> quick<00:03:20.840> cure

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
now I used a high-strength quick cure

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.490 
now I used a high-strength quick cure
fiber<00:03:22.160> filler<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:23.390> fill<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> gaps<00:03:24.140> and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
fiber filler to fill in the gaps and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.710 
fiber filler to fill in the gaps and
make<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.280> backing<00:03:25.700> plate<00:03:25.940> level<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.540> secure

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
make the backing plate level and secure

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.560 
make the backing plate level and secure
and<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.860> stuff<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.340> strong<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.300> got<00:03:29.450> to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
and that stuff is strong but you got to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.480 
and that stuff is strong but you got to
work<00:03:29.690> quick<00:03:29.750> plan<00:03:30.530> ahead<00:03:30.740> because<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.310> only

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
work quick plan ahead because you only

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.910 
work quick plan ahead because you only
have<00:03:31.760> ten<00:03:32.060> minutes<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.480> work<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.050> once

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
have ten minutes to work with it once

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.870 
have ten minutes to work with it once
you<00:03:34.100> mix<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.490> up<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:39.710> key<00:03:39.980> here<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.580> have

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
you mix it up the key here is to have

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.060 
you mix it up the key here is to have
the<00:03:40.940> transducer<00:03:41.840> level<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.830> it's<00:03:42.950> not

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
the transducer level so it's not

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.860 
the transducer level so it's not
shooting<00:03:43.520> out<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:43.940> all<00:03:44.270> kinds<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.750> different

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
shooting out on all kinds of different

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.820 
shooting out on all kinds of different
angles<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.870> use<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.290> quick<00:03:48.530> cure

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
angles and then I use the quick cure

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.080 
angles and then I use the quick cure
version<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.840> 5200<00:03:50.840> which<00:03:51.020> is<00:03:51.380> 4200<00:03:52.280> now

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
version of the 5200 which is 4200 now

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.600 
version of the 5200 which is 4200 now
here's<00:03:53.300> something<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.750> be<00:03:53.900> careful<00:03:54.350> of<00:03:54.610> don't

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
here's something to be careful of don't

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.450 
here's something to be careful of don't
use<00:03:55.940> acetone<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.200> clean<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.710> surface<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
use acetone to clean the surface of the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.030 
use acetone to clean the surface of the
transducer<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.450> don't<00:04:00.200> use<00:04:00.380> alcohol-based

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
transducer and don't use alcohol-based

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.240 
transducer and don't use alcohol-based
cleaners<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.500> 4200<00:04:03.500> because<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.130> will

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
cleaners on the 4200 because that will

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.660 
cleaners on the 4200 because that will
slow<00:04:04.520> or<00:04:04.760> even<00:04:04.790> stop<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.360> curing<00:04:05.900> process<00:04:06.670> so

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
slow or even stop the curing process so

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.670 
slow or even stop the curing process so
what<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> should<00:04:08.030> have<00:04:08.480> done<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.990> I<00:04:09.350> should<00:04:09.560> have

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
what I should have done is I should have

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.650 
what I should have done is I should have
covered<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.160> face<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.700> transducer<00:04:11.150> with

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
covered the face of the transducer with

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.880 
covered the face of the transducer with
tape<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:13.160> no<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.700> didn't<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:14.990> I<00:04:15.020> had<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.470> be<00:04:15.590> very

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
tape but no I didn't so I had to be very

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.250 
tape but no I didn't so I had to be very
careful<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.640> clean<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.180> face<00:04:17.360> with<00:04:17.660> alcohol

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
careful and clean the face with alcohol

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.880 
careful and clean the face with alcohol
and<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.190> sides<00:04:19.489> with<00:04:19.820> acetone<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:21.680> this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
and the sides with acetone now this

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.550 
and the sides with acetone now this
should<00:04:22.100> sit<00:04:22.370> for<00:04:22.580> at<00:04:22.670> least<00:04:22.970> 24<00:04:23.660> hours<00:04:23.690> before

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
should sit for at least 24 hours before

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.670 
should sit for at least 24 hours before
going<00:04:24.800> back<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> water<00:04:26.170> this<00:04:27.170> was<00:04:27.410> fine

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
going back in the water this was fine

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.800 
going back in the water this was fine
because<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.250> gave<00:04:28.430> me<00:04:28.640> time<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.270> run<00:04:29.690> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
because that gave me time to run the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.640 
because that gave me time to run the
wires<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.500> hook<00:04:31.070> up<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> unit<00:04:32.170> now<00:04:33.170> standard
