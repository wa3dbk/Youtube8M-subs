a speed attack all the time Italy

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.390 
a speed attack all the time Italy
increases<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.419> by<00:04:52.540> one<00:04:53.140> level<00:04:53.470> only<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:54.100> makes

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
increases it by one level only it makes

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.240 
increases it by one level only it makes

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
the it makes the time last longer that's

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.530 
the it makes the time last longer that's
all<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.430> does<00:04:58.320> okay<00:04:59.320> in<00:05:00.060> stock<00:05:01.060> mastery

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
all it does okay in stock mastery

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.600 
all it does okay in stock mastery
increases<00:05:02.020> your<00:05:02.080> damage<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.800> adds<00:05:03.250> on<00:05:03.400> more

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
wait what the critical hit okay

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.820 
wait what the critical hit okay
okay<00:05:10.270> stop

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.460 

let's<00:05:15.830> see<00:05:16.009> what<00:05:16.129> else<00:05:16.159> is<00:05:16.370> there<00:05:17.680> yeah<00:05:20.470> it's

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
let's see what else is there yeah it's

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.629 
let's see what else is there yeah it's
pretty<00:05:21.650> easy<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:22.039> level<00:05:22.250> up<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.759> guess<00:05:23.180> it's

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
pretty easy to level up I guess it's

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:34.990 
pretty easy to level up I guess it's
moderate<00:05:25.639> for<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> love<00:05:26.449> leg<00:05:26.599> up<00:05:27.639> stop<00:05:28.639> at<00:05:34.000> most

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
moderate for a love leg up stop at most

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.309 
moderate for a love leg up stop at most
amount<00:05:35.210> of<00:05:35.330> money<00:05:35.599> I<00:05:35.689> spent<00:05:36.080> on<00:05:36.169> this

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
amount of money I spent on this

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.459 
amount of money I spent on this
character<00:05:36.590> was<00:05:36.740> probably<00:05:37.159> about<00:05:37.280> 500<00:05:37.580> k<00:05:38.469> not
