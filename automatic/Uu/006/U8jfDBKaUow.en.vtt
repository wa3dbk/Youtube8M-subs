your<00:01:46.020> paper<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.530> half<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.220> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
your paper in half and it's really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
your paper in half and it's really
important<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.570> good<00:01:49.530> strong

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
important to make really good strong

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
important to make really good strong
creases<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> paper<00:01:51.149> open<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.200> up

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
creases in the paper open it back up

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
creases in the paper open it back up
fold<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.460> half<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.850> direction<00:01:54.180> make

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
fold it in half this direction make

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.719 
fold it in half this direction make
another<00:01:54.899> strong<00:01:55.350> crease<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.399> remember

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
another strong crease and remember

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
another strong crease and remember
creases<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.540> important<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.380> you're

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
creases are really important when you're

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.090 
creases are really important when you're
doing<00:01:58.710> origami<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> triangle<00:02:00.860> out<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
doing origami now make a triangle out of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.719 
doing origami now make a triangle out of
it<00:02:02.280> fold<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.420> another<00:02:03.930> nice<00:02:04.170> crease

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it fold it like this another nice crease

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
it fold it like this another nice crease
open<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:06.000> fold<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> other<00:02:07.110> way

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
open it back up fold the other way

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.779 
open it back up fold the other way
triangle<00:02:08.069> nice<00:02:08.910> crease

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
triangle nice crease

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.959 
triangle nice crease
now<00:02:10.479> what<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.019> want<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.230> do<00:02:11.469> is<00:02:12.340> fold<00:02:12.700> this

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
now what you want to do is fold this

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.539 
now what you want to do is fold this
piece<00:02:13.299> to<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.719> center<00:02:14.340> triangle<00:02:15.340> like<00:02:15.519> this

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
piece to the center triangle like this

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.559 
piece to the center triangle like this
and<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.769> flip<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.159> over

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and then and I think you flip it over

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.539 
and then and I think you flip it over
fold<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:22.959> he's<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.859> now<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.489> is

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
fold it up he's like this now this is

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.990 
fold it up he's like this now this is
going<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.909> be<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.209> mouth<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.170> dinosaur

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
going to be the mouth of the dinosaur

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.630 
going to be the mouth of the dinosaur
eventually<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.629> when<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.709> want<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.430> fold

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
eventually I think when you want to fold

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.429 
eventually I think when you want to fold
it<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.819> half<00:02:30.879> again<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:34.140> triangle<00:02:35.140> with<00:02:35.409> a

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
it in half again and triangle with a

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:42.869 
it in half again and triangle with a
back<00:02:35.799> triangle<00:02:36.659> sideways<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:40.950> okay<00:02:41.950> let<00:02:42.790> me

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
back triangle sideways and okay let me

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.670 
back triangle sideways and okay let me
check<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> directions<00:02:43.540> real<00:02:43.959> quick<00:02:44.200> hold<00:02:44.530> on

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
check the directions real quick hold on

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.780 
check the directions real quick hold on
this<00:02:45.099> is<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.310> working<00:02:45.579> out<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.909> plan<00:02:47.700> maybe<00:02:48.700> I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
this is a working out of plan maybe I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.199 
this is a working out of plan maybe I
fold<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.359> like<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.669> comes<00:02:51.909> in

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
fold it like this and then this comes in

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.490 
fold it like this and then this comes in
like<00:02:52.419> that<00:02:53.700> list<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.939> lip<00:02:55.120> wait<00:02:56.079> now<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.379> just

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
like that list of lip wait now that just

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.429 
like that list of lip wait now that just
looks<00:02:56.709> like<00:02:56.769> an<00:02:56.980> envelope<00:02:57.840> okay<00:02:58.840> wait<00:02:59.409> a

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
looks like an envelope okay wait a

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.500 
looks like an envelope okay wait a
minute<00:02:59.680> I've<00:02:59.859> got<00:02:59.919> a<00:03:00.159> plan<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.150> day<00:03:01.329> is<00:03:01.389> not
