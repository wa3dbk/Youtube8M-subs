00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello here olivier rolland the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.400
 advise smart entrepreneurs and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.259
 smart rebels welcome in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.030
 this new video in which I 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.630
 will share with you a very concept 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.160
 important permission to succeed in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 the problem is we've been 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.560
 formatted by our education especially the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.320
 French education system has always 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 asked permission before doing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 something and that's normal since the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 purpose of the school of the education system 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 French and I talk about it in detail in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 my book coming soon 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 it is to make good workers 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.160
 good employees but certainly not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.230
 good entrepreneurs and when we look 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.710
 entrepreneurs who changed the face 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 of the world 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 we realize that they have at each 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 time daring to create something 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 radically new or not necessarily 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 new but in a radically new way 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 new and they have not asked for the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.570
 permission to other people to be 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 great to be great at doing better than 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 others and bring a lot of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 value to themselves and to the world 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.479
 I mean when we look at his 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 parents at thomas edison steve jobs and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.590
 leaders like gandhi mother teresa and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.150
 it's to say what was their 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 qualification to these people at the beginning 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.619
 to do the huge thing they have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 accomplished i say martin luther king 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.290
 separated at the beginning here is martin luther king 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.450
 a pastor a small provincial pastor 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 gandhi it was just a lawyer 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 what is what in their 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.650
 life in their qualification in this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 that they were giving them concretely 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 permission to say no but wait 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.799
 you guys it's not going at all there is a big 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 big problem in our society and he 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.170
 must change that and here's how we go 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.119
 do it 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.009
 what gave the authorization to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 steve jobs what was kind of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.820
 hippies who did not wash who stank who 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.250
 walked barefoot 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.880
 all the time they came from 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.110
 worry about a dunce at the school of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 partner with steve wozniak for 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.399
 revolutionize the computer nothing of the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.420
 all that gave that is what 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.189
 allowed bill gates to go see 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 ibm with software that even 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.390
 not to sell them a system 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 of exploitation that he needed and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.120
 that ibm could very well have done 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.970
 develop 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.640
 nothing at all there a moment these 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.569
 people gave themselves an email the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 permission to be bold to overtake 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.879
 their little life to allow themselves to think 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.829
 great and accomplish something 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.599
 of extraordinary so I say not everything 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.010
 the world can be steve jobs what in 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.720
 says where martin luther king 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.489
 but what I'm saying is we all have a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.980
 moment in our life hull envy 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.170
 felt a call to do something 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.329
 bigger than us and sometimes we 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.760
 was scared and we did not do it because we 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.810
 said to himself but who am I to be able to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.599
 do this and I do not have diploma I have no 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 two things really in history that 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.140
 allow me to do that to me what 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 I want to tell you is that you 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 can you give permission to 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.090
 succeed or at least give you the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.859
 permission to attempt to succeed from 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.540
 grow and think bigger than this 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.349
 that you currently think of and there are 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.730
 maybe some people who will tell us 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.840
 but you do not have the tapas skills 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.780
 the history you do not make the weight and 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.280
 it may be that they are right but 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.390
 maybe they are completely wrong 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.500
 there is only one way to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.060
 know what is certain is that if you 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.549
 do anything you give them reason to 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.569
 100% so actually what I would like 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.319
 share with you in this video 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.700
 is that I give you permission to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.769
 succeed if you need it 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.299
 if a day maybe today 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.470
 maybe tomorrow maybe in a month 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.319
 maybe in a year maybe in ten 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.910
 years you feel the call 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.560
 this call that pushes you to do 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.319
 something bigger you some 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.209
 scary thing you say but 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.760
 who am I to do that look at this 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.169
 video is listened carefully what I 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.980
 will tell you because I give you 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.220
 permission to succeed you can there 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.949
 go 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.180
 you can try you can even I 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.169
 gives you permission to try and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.440
 to fail but I do not give you the 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.930
 permission to stay there you are and from 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.030
 put in a drawer this project this 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.769
 ambition is dreaming that you have and of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.930
 let the dust take hold while 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.419
 someone else will do this to him 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.340
 step and maybe will succeed 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.680
 may have failed but in any case attempt 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.190
 something that has the mouth that is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.539
 important to him who is connected to this 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.739
 what he is and what he wants to do 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.450
