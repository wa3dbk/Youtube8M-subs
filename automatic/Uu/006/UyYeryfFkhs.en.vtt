a<00:03:13.920> shorter<00:03:14.459> version<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.720> I

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
a shorter version one with just like I

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.350 
a shorter version one with just like I
think<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.380> was<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.890> or<00:03:17.190> something<00:03:17.400> it's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
think it was like this or something it's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.660 
think it was like this or something it's
like<00:03:18.510> maybe<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.560> big<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:20.519> you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
like maybe like this big and then you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.670 
like maybe like this big and then you
can<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.090> kind<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.870> put<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.500> right<00:03:22.620> here

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
can just kind of like put it right here

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.590 
can just kind of like put it right here
and<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.280> can't<00:03:23.550> really<00:03:23.880> wear<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.180> because

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
and you can't really wear it because

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.520 
and you can't really wear it because
it's<00:03:24.780> too<00:03:24.959> short<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:27.750> know<00:03:27.870> overall<00:03:28.350> I

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's too short but you know overall I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.560 
it's too short but you know overall I
think<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.040> bag<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.519> very<00:03:29.790> nice<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.450> very

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
think this bag is very nice and very

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.430 
think this bag is very nice and very
casual<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.500> everyday<00:03:32.160> kind<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.550> use<00:03:32.820> but

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
casual for everyday kind of use but

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.220 
casual for everyday kind of use but
there<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:34.920> bad<00:03:35.250> thing<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.850> think<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:36.930> this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
there is one bad thing I think for this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.809 
there is one bad thing I think for this
bag<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> design<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.340> this

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
bag like the design of this

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.240 
bag like the design of this
it's<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> bottom<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.099> it's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
it's on the bottom because you see it's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.020 
it's on the bottom because you see it's
kind<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.610> very<00:03:41.879> flimsy<00:03:42.840> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.760> material<00:03:44.760> so

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
kind of very flimsy kind of material so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.530 
kind of very flimsy kind of material so
miss<00:03:45.689> one<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:47.730> know<00:03:47.879> when<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.209> put<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
miss one on so you know when you put a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.240 
miss one on so you know when you put a
whole<00:03:48.870> bunch<00:03:49.079> of<00:03:49.230> stuff<00:03:50.000> inside<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
whole bunch of stuff inside and it's it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.949 
whole bunch of stuff inside and it's it
kind<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.640> drags<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.390> like<00:03:55.189> this<00:03:56.189> like<00:03:57.000> this

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
kind of drags down like this like this

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.860 
kind of drags down like this like this
you<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.859> look<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.549> shape<00:03:59.909> is<00:04:00.180> gone<00:04:00.569> and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
you know and look the shape is gone and

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.280 
you know and look the shape is gone and
I<00:04:00.959> don't<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:02.629> usually<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.959> put

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
I don't really like that usually I put

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.160 
I don't really like that usually I put
like<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> notebook<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:06.299> maybe

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
like a notebook like this and then maybe

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.670 
like a notebook like this and then maybe
my<00:04:07.680> cell<00:04:08.189> phone<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.269> stuff<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.680> you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
my cell phone and all that stuff so you

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.610 
my cell phone and all that stuff so you
see<00:04:10.889> when<00:04:11.159> i<00:04:11.459> zip<00:04:12.120> everything<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:15.259> it's<00:04:16.259> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
see when i zip everything up it's the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.539 
see when i zip everything up it's the
shape<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.459> all<00:04:17.989> distorted<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.349> guess<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.859> I

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
shape it's all distorted I guess and I

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.020 
shape it's all distorted I guess and I
don't<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.750> it's<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:23.130> really<00:04:23.849> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030
