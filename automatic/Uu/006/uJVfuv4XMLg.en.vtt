switch back and forth between butter or
something<00:01:24.240> rise<00:01:24.540> gonna<00:01:24.810> count<00:01:25.189> it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.400> really

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
something rise gonna count it's a really

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.950 
something rise gonna count it's a really
good<00:01:27.030> efficient<00:01:27.479> system

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
good efficient system

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.469 
good efficient system
this<00:01:28.439> fat<00:01:28.770> battery<00:01:29.220> compares<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.270> most

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this fat battery compares to what most

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.120 
this fat battery compares to what most
people<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.170> 70<00:01:31.500> pound<00:01:31.619> deep<00:01:31.829> cycle

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
people would take a 70 pound deep cycle

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
people would take a 70 pound deep cycle
battery<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.420> 10<00:01:33.570> times<00:01:33.720> lighter

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
battery so it's over 10 times lighter

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.700 
battery so it's over 10 times lighter
than<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.350> people<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.710> expect<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:37.500> has<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
than what people would expect it has a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.960 
than what people would expect it has a
range<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.400> 16<00:01:39.180> miles<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> charge<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
range of about 16 miles on a charge and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.440 
range of about 16 miles on a charge and
so<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.420> producing<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.960> hour<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
so are they producing an hour or so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.540 
so are they producing an hour or so
fifteen<00:01:45.450> seventy<00:01:46.110> miles<00:01:46.380> somewhere<00:01:47.340> in

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
fifteen seventy miles somewhere in

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.200 
fifteen seventy miles somewhere in
and<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:49.520> really<00:01:50.520> depends<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> speed

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and that really depends on the speed

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.360 
and that really depends on the speed
you're<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.390> subculture<00:01:52.260> miles<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.680> hour<00:01:52.800> or

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
you're going subculture miles an hour or

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.560 
you're going subculture miles an hour or
they<00:01:53.490> extend<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.820> line<00:01:54.000> when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.360> closer

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
they extend the line when you get closer

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260 
they extend the line when you get closer
than<00:01:54.840> 160<00:01:55.620> miles<00:01:55.830> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.730> crank<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.030> wide<00:01:57.240> open

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
than 160 miles if you crank it wide open

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.610 
than 160 miles if you crank it wide open
it<00:01:57.630> will<00:01:57.750> actually<00:01:57.870> do<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.140> close<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.440> six

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
it will actually do you close to six

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.470 
it will actually do you close to six
miles<00:01:58.830> an<00:01:59.010> hour<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.760> that's<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.330> going<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
miles an hour but that's really going to

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.910 
miles an hour but that's really going to
cut<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.930> range<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.410> be<00:02:01.500> simply<00:02:01.740> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
cut down your range it can be simply for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.470 
cut down your range it can be simply for
like<00:02:02.100> three<00:02:02.310> miles<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:03.270> 30<00:02:03.540> minutes

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.690

I've<00:02:08.820> got<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.970> handy<00:02:09.360> assistant<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:09.960> come<00:02:10.290> on

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I've got a handy assistant here come on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:22.850 
I've got a handy assistant here come on
over<00:02:10.650> ahead<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:22.260> your<00:02:22.380> controller

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
over ahead with your controller

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.240 
over ahead with your controller
it's<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.300> forward<00:02:24.300> reverse<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.100> neutral

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's got forward reverse it's in neutral

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.610 
it's got forward reverse it's in neutral
now<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.840> crank<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.170> board<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> also

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
now so as we crank this board it also

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.920 
now so as we crank this board it also
has<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> magnetic<00:02:29.370> key<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> jet<00:02:30.750> ski

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
has a magnetic key it's like a jet ski

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.140 
has a magnetic key it's like a jet ski
so<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> fall<00:02:31.410> off<00:02:31.650> connect<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.700> line<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so if you fall off connect this line to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.570 
so if you fall off connect this line to
you<00:02:33.240> upon<00:02:33.390> TFP<00:02:33.900> people<00:02:34.770> lock<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.250> shut<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you upon TFP people lock it shut the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
you upon TFP people lock it shut the
thing<00:02:35.610> off<00:02:35.790> automatically<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.900> also<00:02:36.990> has<00:02:37.170> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
thing off automatically it also has a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.390 
thing off automatically it also has a
chip<00:02:37.470> built<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.860> kind<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.070> like<00:02:38.160> cell<00:02:38.370> phones

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
chip built in kind of like cell phones

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.580 
chip built in kind of like cell phones
that<00:02:38.880> allow<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.630> screen<00:02:40.020> Digory<00:02:40.350> when<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that allow the screen Digory when you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.200 
that allow the screen Digory when you
turn<00:02:40.770> your<00:02:40.920> phone<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.820> if<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.030> boat

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
turns over the motor shuts off a lot of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.240 
turns over the motor shuts off a lot of
great<00:02:44.610> safety<00:02:44.940> mechanisms<00:02:45.540> built<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.410> as

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
great safety mechanisms built in and as

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
great safety mechanisms built in and as
you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.460> tell<00:02:47.520> it's<00:02:47.790> good<00:02:47.940> quick<00:02:48.210> though<00:02:48.600> just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you can tell it's good quick though just

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
you can tell it's good quick though just
push<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.440> board<00:02:49.740> take<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.730> clutter<00:02:51.120> stay<00:02:51.390> on

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
push this board take on clutter stay on

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.450 
push this board take on clutter stay on
steering's<00:02:52.050> there<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.970> off<00:02:54.239> they<00:02:54.420> go
