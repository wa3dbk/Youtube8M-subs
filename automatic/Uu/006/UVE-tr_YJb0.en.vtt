00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.380
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.900
 this new video of us that it now 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.120
 a completely different video namely 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.189
 Let's introduce ourselves as we do 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.259
 that all present here is always 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.360
 forecast and presumably that will be 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.090
 Let's start directly so who with 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.740
 once the performance there is a 1 8 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.020
 gigahertz processor also samsung 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.750
 already halfway imagined and then 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.390
 we think that the new access is five 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.070
 opta core processor with eight cores too 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.350
 It is installed in the samsung 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.270
 also presented recently and the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.980
 Memory or rem is actually 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.390
 still unclear but we just go 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.520
 assume that the two gigabytes 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.070
 will be and the internal memory 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.010
 he is sometimes optional 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.960
 selectable between 16 and 64 gb and the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 this will be a 2600 battery 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.280
 milliamp is actually 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 even sure this brings us to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.469
 display collection has been so recently 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.379
 but a flexible display is presented 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.119
 we think that will not happen in the s4 yet 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.930
 be installed because that is still 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.720
 not really developed because of that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.790
 at the earliest in s5 think how to do that 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.049
 display is a super plus as well 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.979
 already with the predecessor version 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.869
 The display will be 49 or 5 inches tall 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.439
 but that is not so clear 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.840
 We expect the display to be 5 inches 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.820
 is an indestructible gorilla glass 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.470
 display as already with the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 previous versions and the resolution 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.950
 should be 100 20 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.759
 Of course, the operating system is always 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.420
 android so 4.2.1 et labora extra 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.740
 update made and tattoo it is the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.509
 user interface of samsung is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.020
 of course also integrated again exactly 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.869
 like the lasso module that means you can 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.000
 Share 22 applications on the screen 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 and at the same time actively execute as at 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.450
 no2 you can do the lighting 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.939
 then we come to the cameras 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.979
 front camera will probably be 5 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.890
 megapixels dissolve and the rear camera 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.060
 with 12 or 3 10 megapixel and not 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.550
 as clearly as one will be installed 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.319
 a newly developed image stabilizer 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.930
 of samsung, of course, not optical 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.269
 but digital 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.189
 a dual flash and the camera becomes very much 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:27.010
 be compact so that we are there 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.269
 have imagined that the cell phone that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.329
 smartphone maybe nine millimeters 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.909
 be thin that's relative 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.859
 attached at the size and samsung 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.540
 symbol will be under the display 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.299
 we think well and not that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.359
 Design will have that just like the s2 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.209
 and not like the s3 and will be available 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.799
 at the black and white blue and red and 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 the shape may resemble one 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.689
 bit in iphone 5 you can do that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.019
 imagine 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.609
 a little more angular then you come here 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.769
 to the picture we created that 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.379
 not a perfect picture because of that 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.480
 we just created with program 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.450
 that's why it's not perfect now 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.790
 as well as a graphic but here under the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.620
 display the samsung symbol over the home 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.849
 button on the back again 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.349
 just a bit above the bigger here 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.959
 camera you can see very nice the dual 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.379
 lightning and yes from the side her 9 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.419
 millimeter thick that will be yes then 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.220
