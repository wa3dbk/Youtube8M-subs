00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
and it was really interesting to try to

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.720 
and it was really interesting to try to
understand<00:01:35.940> people<00:01:36.380> by<00:01:37.380> drawing<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.670 

I<00:01:42.240> started<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.330> draw<00:01:43.479> colors<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:44.170> use<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> lot

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.210 

or<00:01:53.700> colorist<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.290> shape<00:01:55.680> starts<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
or colorist and then shape starts to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.880 
or colorist and then shape starts to
become<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.700> bit<00:01:56.880> weirder<00:01:57.890> more

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
become a little bit weirder more

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.830 
become a little bit weirder more
abstract<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.970> was<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.299> realized<00:02:00.690> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
abstract and then I was I realized like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.210 
abstract and then I was I realized like
wait<00:02:01.080> this<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.440> interesting

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
wait this is interesting

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.359 
wait this is interesting
maybe<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.720> should<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> doing<00:02:04.790> so

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
maybe this is what I should be doing so

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
maybe this is what I should be doing so
yeah<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> started<00:02:08.520> doing<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.750> feels<00:02:10.020> right

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
yeah I started doing this it feels right

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.800 
yeah I started doing this it feels right
it<00:02:10.560> feels<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:11.340> very<00:02:11.550> interesting<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it feels it's very interesting when I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.710 
it feels it's very interesting when I
was<00:02:12.900> drawing<00:02:13.290> comics<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.130> people<00:02:15.739> characters

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
was drawing comics and people characters

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.570 
was drawing comics and people characters

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you're also drawing or making a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000 
you're also drawing or making a
representation<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.180> something<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.010> could

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
representation of something that could

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.400 
representation of something that could
exist<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.640> doesn't<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.090> exist<00:02:24.320> even<00:02:25.320> if

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
exist that doesn't really exist even if

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.290 
exist that doesn't really exist even if
what<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.650> drawing<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:27.090> very

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
what I'm drawing now it's it's very

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.360 
what I'm drawing now it's it's very
abstract<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.320> not<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.920> representation

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
abstract it's it's not a representation

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.699 
abstract it's it's not a representation
of<00:02:29.700> an<00:02:29.850> object<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.450> try<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.989> draw<00:02:31.260> something

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
of an object I try to draw something

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.330 
of an object I try to draw something
that<00:02:31.739> could<00:02:32.190> exist<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.480> could<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.900> real<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that could exist that could be real so I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.460 
that could exist that could be real so I
in<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.820> way<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.570> as<00:02:36.720> sculptures

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
in a way I think of them as sculptures

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.120 
in a way I think of them as sculptures
that<00:02:37.830> don't<00:02:38.160> exist<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:39.890> was<00:02:40.890> trying<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that don't exist I was trying to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.720 
that don't exist I was trying to
understand<00:02:41.519> things<00:02:41.670> from

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
understand things from

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.140 
understand things from
from<00:02:44.360> inside<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.870> house<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:45.709> like

from inside your house now I'm like

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.479 
from inside your house now I'm like
looking<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.330> picture<00:02:47.599> from<00:02:48.099> from<00:02:49.099> Google

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
looking at a picture from from Google

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.130 
looking at a picture from from Google
Earth<00:02:49.670> at<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.480> same<00:02:50.750> time<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.049> I'm

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
Earth at the same time that I'm

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.479 
Earth at the same time that I'm
discovering<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.849> kind<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.209> painting

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
discovering this this kind of painting

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.000 
discovering this this kind of painting
that<00:02:55.489> I'm<00:02:55.640> trying<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:57.080> also<00:02:57.349> discovering

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that I'm trying now I'm also discovering

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.820 
that I'm trying now I'm also discovering
some<00:02:58.250> power<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.060> discovering<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.690> same

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.680 

I<00:03:05.970> guess<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> could<00:03:07.240> say<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.540> their

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
I guess you could say that their

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.420 
I guess you could say that their
emotional<00:03:08.260> structures<00:03:08.740> I<00:03:08.980> guess<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.280> could

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
emotional structures I guess you could

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.620 
emotional structures I guess you could
say<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.730> their<00:03:11.340> structures<00:03:12.340> about<00:03:12.880> life<00:03:13.180> is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
say that their structures about life is

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
say that their structures about life is
such<00:03:13.810> as<00:03:13.990> about<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.620> composition<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
such as about the composition in a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.870 
such as about the composition in a
painting<00:03:15.820> they<00:03:16.300> keep<00:03:16.480> showing<00:03:17.700> they<00:03:18.700> keep

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
painting they keep showing they keep

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.390 
painting they keep showing they keep
showing<00:03:19.030> because<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:19.500> when<00:03:20.500> I'm<00:03:20.620> making<00:03:20.980> them

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
showing because in when I'm making them

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.520 
showing because in when I'm making them
it<00:03:21.700> helps<00:03:22.000> everything<00:03:22.330> keep<00:03:22.600> together<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.230> have

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
it helps everything keep together I have

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.750 
it helps everything keep together I have
this<00:03:23.680> physical<00:03:24.190> need<00:03:24.400> when<00:03:24.580> I'm<00:03:24.670> painting

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this physical need when I'm painting

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.810 
this physical need when I'm painting
that<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.330> painting<00:03:28.990> actually<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:30.100> stay<00:03:30.640> by

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
that the painting actually can stay by

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.390 
that the painting actually can stay by
itself<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.560> don't<00:03:32.740> need<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.890> be<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
itself that I don't need to be in the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.520 
itself that I don't need to be in the
painting<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.420> make<00:03:34.540> sense<00:03:34.600> or<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
painting for it to make sense or for it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.040 
painting for it to make sense or for it
to<00:03:35.560> be<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:37.510> balance

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
to be in balance

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.850 
to be in balance
it's<00:03:38.950> not<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.370> an<00:03:39.490> aesthetical<00:03:40.500> search<00:03:41.500> for

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
it's not just an aesthetical search for

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.120 
it's not just an aesthetical search for
balance<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.730> guess<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.690> deeper<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.530> deeper

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
balance I guess it's a deeper a deeper

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.510 
balance I guess it's a deeper a deeper
search<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:46.570> balance<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.920> balance<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.490> life

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
search of balance like a balance in life

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.620 
search of balance like a balance in life
balancing<00:03:49.530> with<00:03:50.530> oneself<00:03:51.270> balance<00:03:52.270> with<00:03:52.420> what

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
balancing with oneself balance with what

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.390 
balancing with oneself balance with what
you<00:03:52.750> feel<00:03:52.990> with<00:03:53.320> who<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.620> are<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.190> me<00:03:54.220> it's

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you feel with who you are to me it's

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.890 
you feel with who you are to me it's
more<00:03:54.520> an<00:03:54.760> emotional<00:03:55.300> or<00:03:55.450> spiritual

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
more an emotional or spiritual

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.550 
more an emotional or spiritual
experience<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.040> sense<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:59.310> can't<00:04:01.560> if

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
experience in the sense that I can't if

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.930 
experience in the sense that I can't if
I<00:04:02.710> think<00:04:02.770> too<00:04:02.950> much<00:04:03.160> about<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.490> it<00:04:03.760> doesn't

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
I think too much about it it doesn't

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.650 
I think too much about it it doesn't
work<00:04:04.440> if<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.590> try<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.800> rationalize<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.730> or<00:04:06.970> think

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
work if I try to rationalize it or think

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.290 
work if I try to rationalize it or think
too<00:04:07.780> much<00:04:07.930> about<00:04:07.990> a<00:04:08.530> painting<00:04:09.100> or<00:04:09.310> what<00:04:10.150> they

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
too much about a painting or what they

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.440 
too much about a painting or what they
put<00:04:10.480> something<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:11.410> doesn't<00:04:11.739> really<00:04:11.860> work<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
put something it doesn't really work I

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.490 
put something it doesn't really work I
just<00:04:13.450> paint<00:04:13.660> until<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.989> find<00:04:14.230> something

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
just paint until I find something

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.150

but if I find it I'm I would be really
happy<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.340> don't<00:04:36.790> think<00:04:36.940> they<00:04:37.030> are<00:04:37.060> perfect<00:04:37.330> I

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720

don't think they are

I<00:04:38.530> would<00:04:38.980> change<00:04:39.220> stuff<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.590> don't<00:04:41.770> think<00:04:41.950> I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
I would change stuff but I don't think I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.410 
I would change stuff but I don't think I
should<00:04:42.130> change<00:04:42.610> stuff

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
should change stuff

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.410 
should change stuff
because<00:04:43.810> they're<00:04:44.050> fine<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.500> way<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.620> is<00:04:44.770> I'm

because they're fine the way it is I'm

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.000 
because they're fine the way it is I'm
pretty<00:04:46.420> sure<00:04:46.660> not<00:04:46.960> everybody<00:04:47.410> will<00:04:47.590> find<00:04:47.800> in
