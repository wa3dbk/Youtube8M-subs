00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 ah 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello to all and policies we achieve lobby 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 of hardcore gamers on Saturday 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.160
 defeated where a little bit will be taught 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.730
 what it is used for and how smoke is used 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.560
 of deception in a normal and common game 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 is the smoke of deception is used well 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 comes to a support in this case being 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 lemon is driving me and throwing a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.350
 cheating model about the most amount of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.379
 possible allies 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 then let's stop a moment the 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.960
 team that has the smoke in this case 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 it goes into the territory of the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.140
 rival team since while you have as 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.040
 of cheating on you can not be seen 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.840
 you can not go past ward's you can 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 move next to your clips you can 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.620
 throw all the skills you have 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.530
 you can throw all kinds of skills or 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.780
 how cool you can throw your hook and if 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.040
 I'm not mistaken , you do not leave the smoke 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.520
 scam 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.370
 1 and 1 of the year can only be broken 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.100
 if you attack or following in the field of 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.320
 vision of an enemy in this case 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.350
 we were getting closer here 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 in this area from here to here then 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.820
 more or less when you get to this area of 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.130
 here maybe something closer because it was 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.189
 night 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.960
 the opposing team would have us inside 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.049
 of the field of vision 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.450
 and the deception would be broken because we will be 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.640
 visible but while we remain 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.290
 here in this area outside your field of 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.770
 vision will be totally invisible to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.560
 they 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.079
 this is what this is for 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.229
 using us to make a granca 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.119
 its jungle and be able to throw the tower but 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.600
 It is also quite useful with characters 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 as a course or lycanthrope that can be 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.399
 make it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.619
 the royal of the hills at the beginning of 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.119
 game as the method of entering with the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.630
 cheating without being seen by the rival team 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.390
 and certify thee or simply because for 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.090
 approach them from behind the lines 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.060
 enemies and take them the most 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.069
 number of possible deaths 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.489
 and this kind of most talked about things 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.190
 reduce to gangs but a 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.380
 detail that we have to have always has 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.569
 used the deception we have to know 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.450
 with some accuracy where is the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 opposing team because we 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.989
 we have thrown the smoke of deception here in 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.210
 this area has excited us the smoke of 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.390
 cheating and when you get here 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.480
 we had already spent almost the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.819
 half 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.760
 is what you can do that if instead of 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.310
 be here in this area here would have 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.780
 been here we talk about experience of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 a lot of time going down in the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.230
 cheating world a lot of money 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.640
 buying a lot of money either 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 because it's worth 100 but good is money 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.600
 and we would have to repeat the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.600
 process would really catch us leveling 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.900
 stay us 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.450
 so the best complement for the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.930
 Germans are the guardians and now we're going to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.380
 see how this ends up being a little bit 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.650
 no ball arrives at bunge entering vision 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.040
 it breaks between salatin fight and good a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.040
 a lot of 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.500
 of destruction and this is good for another 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.390
 point another point that we will explain 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.940
 more or less at this moment a little 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.240
 later 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.070
 maybe it was not so far behind 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.700
 to get through here the whole team arrives 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.700
 that is regrouping 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:51.450
 we started here you can feel the hook 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.040
 its not multi lie and here it uses 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.840
 the true vision powders 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.280
 I also wanted to deal with the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.560
 true vision powders what they do 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.830
 is to reveal to all enemies 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 invisible for a period of time 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.840
 at this moment we use it to be able 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.260
 see webber that becomes invisible and 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.940
 as you can see here has the symbol of the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.250
 powder 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.070
 this what it does is that while the 62 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.900
 of the peoples be active we 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.470
 we could see him even if it were done 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.200
 invisible 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.570
 and the good one you can know that we are 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.580
 seeing why it has here the little symbol of 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.700
 the powder but can not do anything to 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.290
 take it off so that if you're in the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.840
 area of ​​the powders that basically I 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.790
 it seems like it's a thing or so until 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.100
 here is quite a circular 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.540
 big guy if he catches you inside this 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.920
 logic of the powders on top though 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.830
 you have invisible the opposite team you 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.290
 going to see 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.720
 and effectively here a little more 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.880
 forward weaver had the warning icon 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.590
 true on top of the powders and although 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.130
 it is invisible we can finish it 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.800
 easily and the guys made a 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.260
 video that he thought it was important to do 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.600
 because there are many people who do not know to 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.600
 What is the use of the smoke of deception in 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.910
 revelation powders and it's a detail 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.640
 quite important enough to know 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.320
 use these two objects because they can 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.150
 change the heading of the game because 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.700
 They have a team that got us going 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.050
 all the lines and us using 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.990
 the smoke of deceit we could get to 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.960
 here and have this afternoon easily 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.910
 comes in handy to gain space in the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.920
 map when it is drying a bit 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.190
 trapped comes in handy to do 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.950
 great initiatives and it's a very object 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.590
 recommended for all of you so 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.970
 what guys thanks for watching the video and 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.680
 I hope you use 9 deception many 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.680
 times to make goodbye comics
