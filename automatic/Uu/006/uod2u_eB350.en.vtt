what<00:00:31.250> do<00:00:31.340> we<00:00:31.369> think

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.670 

it's<00:00:36.949> all

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.410 

put<00:00:40.160> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.729 

yeah<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.450> think<00:00:46.690> that's<00:00:47.020> where<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.470> get<00:00:47.590> to

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
yeah I think that's where you get to

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.319 
yeah I think that's where you get to
enjoy<00:00:47.860> his<00:00:48.070> notice<00:00:48.400> because<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:48.760> sports<00:00:49.059> mode

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
enjoy his notice because in sports mode

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.299 
enjoy his notice because in sports mode
and<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.110> exhaust<00:00:50.410> takes<00:00:50.680> over<00:00:50.980> this<00:00:51.070> whole

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
and the exhaust takes over this whole

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.820 
and the exhaust takes over this whole
different<00:00:51.790> ball<00:00:52.120> together<00:00:52.590> yeah<00:00:53.590> when<00:00:53.770> you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
different ball together yeah when you

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.410 
different ball together yeah when you
start<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.220> really<00:00:54.370> get<00:00:54.820> through<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.030> corners

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
start to really get through the corners

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.729 
start to really get through the corners
you<00:00:55.629> know<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.930> can<00:00:56.079> see<00:00:56.230> how<00:00:56.350> whether<00:00:56.620> it

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
you know you can see how whether it

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.680 
you know you can see how whether it
manages<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.160> put<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.460> power<00:00:57.640> down<00:00:57.760> there's<00:00:58.570> a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
manages to put the power down there's a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.030 
manages to put the power down there's a
little<00:00:58.870> bit<00:00:59.050> one<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.350> do<00:00:59.530> when<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.800> really

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
little bit one to do when you really

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.170 
little bit one to do when you really
throw<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.309> about<00:01:00.550> but<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.820> will<00:01:00.910> stroke

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
throw it about but it will stroke

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:13.149 
throw it about but it will stroke
through<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:07.050> solving<00:01:08.050> simple<00:01:08.619> Mets

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.739 

yeah<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.819> a<00:01:14.880> lot<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> sibling<00:01:15.539> you<00:01:15.630> can

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
yeah there's a lot of sibling you can

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.630 
yeah there's a lot of sibling you can
actually<00:01:16.049> physically<00:01:16.380> feel<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> back

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
actually physically feel it at the back

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
actually physically feel it at the back
of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.819> car<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> does<00:01:18.899> mean<00:01:19.079> that<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of the car but it does mean that this is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.060 
of the car but it does mean that this is
fairly<00:01:19.799> rigid<00:01:20.069> up<00:01:20.310> here

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.380 

sighs

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.670 

yeah<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.540> isn't<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.870> high<00:01:30.020> line<00:01:30.290> isn't<00:01:30.500> it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
yeah it isn't a high line isn't it

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.930 
yeah it isn't a high line isn't it
really

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
really

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.870 
really
I<00:01:32.000> think<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:33.230> like<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.070> shape<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.550> thing<00:01:34.760> I

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
I think I like the shape of this thing I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.250 
I think I like the shape of this thing I
like<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.180> way<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.420> looks<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.080> fact

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
like the way it looks I like the fact

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.190 
like the way it looks I like the fact
that<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.530> funky<00:01:36.950> cool<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.520> think<00:01:38.180> if<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.900> was<00:01:39.050> to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that this funky cool I think if I was to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.510 
that this funky cool I think if I was to
actually<00:01:39.320> buy<00:01:39.650> when<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.890> still<00:01:40.160> go<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
actually buy when I still go for the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.010 
actually buy when I still go for the
hands<00:01:40.700> back<00:01:40.910> it<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.120> makes<00:01:41.450> more<00:01:41.600> sense<00:01:41.840> to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
hands back it just makes more sense to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.490 
hands back it just makes more sense to
me

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.820 

of<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.830> body

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.730

con because I'll tell you why the spread

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.510 
con because I'll tell you why the spread
is<00:02:43.390> too<00:02:43.750> big<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.890> obviously<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:45.400> you're

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
is too big so obviously when you're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.040 
is too big so obviously when you're
looking<00:02:45.730> down<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.090> road<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.020> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
looking down the road for you to a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320 
looking down the road for you to a
refocusing<00:02:47.950> than<00:02:48.250> V<00:02:48.520> find<00:02:48.880> out<00:02:49.060> where<00:02:49.240> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
refocusing than V find out where the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.260 
refocusing than V find out where the
needle<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:50.890> too<00:02:51.040> hard<00:02:51.280> which<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
needle is it's just too hard which is

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.970 
needle is it's just too hard which is
which<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.540> why<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.650> set<00:02:53.830> this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
which is why is it can you just set this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.370 
which is why is it can you just set this
over<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.180> speedometer<00:02:55.780> there's<00:02:56.230> a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
over here to the speedometer there's a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.950 
over here to the speedometer there's a
bit<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.560> showmanship<00:02:57.220> really<00:03:03.720> well<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
bit of showmanship really well the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.390 
bit of showmanship really well the
interesting<00:03:05.350> thing<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.740> they<00:03:05.950> need<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
interesting thing is that they need to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.430 
interesting thing is that they need to
do<00:03:06.760> mini<00:03:07.000> connect<00:03:07.390> system<00:03:07.570> which<00:03:07.990> is<00:03:08.140> running

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
do mini connect system which is running

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.440 
do mini connect system which is running
for<00:03:08.590> an<00:03:08.680> iphone<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:09.610> they've<00:03:09.760> got<00:03:09.970> over<00:03:10.270> here

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
for an iphone that they've got over here

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.720
