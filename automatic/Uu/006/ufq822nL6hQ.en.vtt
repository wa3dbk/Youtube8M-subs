tablet it's real wireless network so so
get<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.909> lag<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.780> actual

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

set up like this above here here is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.359 
set up like this above here here is
Liam's<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.329> pushed<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Liam's just pushed up so I can use this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
Liam's just pushed up so I can use this
as<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> selector<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
as a selector but I do all the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.069 
as a selector but I do all the
programming<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> day<00:01:48.869> before

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
programming you know the day before

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
programming you know the day before
anyway<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.790> need<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> see

video
failures<00:02:14.490> I'm<00:02:14.610> only<00:02:14.760> using<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> MIDI<00:02:15.600> control

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
failures I'm only using the MIDI control

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.850 
failures I'm only using the MIDI control
surface<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.560> DNX<00:02:17.490> 1600<00:02:18.500> which<00:02:19.500> works<00:02:19.800> really

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
surface of DNX 1600 which works really

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.520 
surface of DNX 1600 which works really
well

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
well

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.410 
well
so<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> basically<00:02:23.010> use<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.250> like<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.490> DJ<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.930 

want<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> hand<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:28.460> I've<00:02:29.460> also<00:02:29.610> got<00:02:29.910> some

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
want to hand it I've also got some

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.810 
want to hand it I've also got some
buttons<00:02:30.360> mapped<00:02:30.720> via<00:02:31.710> MIDI<00:02:31.950> through<00:02:32.310> to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
buttons mapped via MIDI through to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.570 
buttons mapped via MIDI through to
resolume<00:02:33.240> as<00:02:33.480> well<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.290> DMX<00:02:35.130> chain<00:02:35.430> as

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
resolume as well as the DMX chain as

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.020 
resolume as well as the DMX chain as
well<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.300> you'll<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:38.100> video<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
well so you'll see the video and the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.730 
well so you'll see the video and the
lighting<00:02:39.360> changes<00:02:39.390> at<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> same<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.350> I've

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
lighting changes at the same time I've

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.620 
lighting changes at the same time I've
got<00:02:40.860> some<00:02:41.040> patches<00:02:41.460> hooked<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.210> also<00:02:42.480> got

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
got some patches hooked in also got

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.240 
got some patches hooked in also got
strobe<00:02:42.960> so<00:02:43.230> everything<00:02:43.560> strobes<00:02:43.860> at<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.070> same

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
strobe so everything strobes at the same

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.780 
strobe so everything strobes at the same
time<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:45.960> mute<00:02:46.170> button<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.520> got<00:02:47.640> all

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
time and a mute button so you got all

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.310 
time and a mute button so you got all
lighting<00:02:48.240> cranked<00:02:48.600> up<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:48.990> want<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.230> to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
lighting cranked up and you want it to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.340 
lighting cranked up and you want it to
be<00:02:49.410> black<00:02:49.920> instantly<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:51.030> button<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:52.320> button

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
be black instantly one button one button

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520 
be black instantly one button one button
on<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> UM<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.850> mixer<00:02:54.450> kills<00:02:55.260> everything

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
on the UM on the mixer kills everything

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.140 
on the UM on the mixer kills everything
which<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.010> great<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.310> break<00:02:56.520> downs<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
which is great for break downs and so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.560 
which is great for break downs and so
forth<00:02:57.500> now<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.650> whole<00:02:58.830> system<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.670> running

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
forth now this whole system is running

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.890 
forth now this whole system is running
just<00:03:00.900> off<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> One<00:03:01.350> Laptop<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:03.090> GC<00:03:03.510> Keys<00:03:03.720> got

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
just off the One Laptop the GC Keys got

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170 
just off the One Laptop the GC Keys got
enough<00:03:04.140> grunt<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.460> really<00:03:05.730> cheap<00:03:05.940> too

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
enough grunt and it's really cheap too

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.360 
enough grunt and it's really cheap too
compared<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> Mac<00:03:07.200> Pro<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.560> anything<00:03:07.770> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
compared to a Mac Pro or anything I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.520 
compared to a Mac Pro or anything I
haven't<00:03:08.940> had<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> crash<00:03:09.510> or<00:03:09.810> glitch<00:03:10.260> or

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
haven't had it crash or glitch or

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.130 
haven't had it crash or glitch or
anything<00:03:10.950> once<00:03:11.430> during<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.970> show<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.930> also

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
anything once during a show I can also

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.920 
anything once during a show I can also
run<00:03:13.500> Ableton<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.280> cerrado<00:03:14.760> off<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.690> same

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
run Ableton or cerrado off the same

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.550 
run Ableton or cerrado off the same
thing<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:17.040> over<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.940> top

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
thing and just have it up over the top

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.640 
thing and just have it up over the top
and<00:03:19.560> use<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.540> audio<00:03:22.200> controller

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
and use that as a as a audio controller

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.720 
and use that as a as a audio controller
as<00:03:22.890> well<00:03:23.220> as<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.510> MIDI<00:03:24.800> video<00:03:25.800> controls

as well as the MIDI video controls

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.570 
as well as the MIDI video controls
running<00:03:27.600> underneath<00:03:27.900> without<00:03:28.830> any<00:03:29.100> problems

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580

running underneath without any problems
at<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.850> I've<00:03:30.270> tested<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.140> few<00:03:31.320> hours

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
at all I've tested this for a few hours

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.970 
at all I've tested this for a few hours
straight<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:31.950> not<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:32.700> glitch<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.840> all<00:03:34.050> which

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
straight and not one glitch at all which

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.750 
straight and not one glitch at all which
is<00:03:35.010> quite<00:03:35.310> impressive

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
is quite impressive

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.690 
is quite impressive
you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.270> also<00:03:36.420> internally<00:03:37.080> route<00:03:37.700> MIDI

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
you can also internally route MIDI

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.130 
you can also internally route MIDI
information<00:03:39.380> between<00:03:40.380> programs<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:42.140> for

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
information between programs so for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.670 
information between programs so for
instance<00:03:43.440> Ableton<00:03:44.600> controlling<00:03:45.680> resolume

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
instance Ableton controlling resolume

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
instance Ableton controlling resolume
and<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.130> lighting<00:03:47.520> as<00:03:47.700> well<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:48.209> being<00:03:48.420> able

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
and the lighting as well as being able

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.630 
and the lighting as well as being able
to<00:03:48.720> manually<00:03:49.230> control<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.709> externally<00:03:50.100> which

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
to manually control it externally which

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.480 
to manually control it externally which
works<00:03:50.910> quite<00:03:51.180> well<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.250> bit<00:03:53.400> of

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
works quite well and it's just a bit of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.230 
works quite well and it's just a bit of
an<00:03:53.580> example<00:03:54.200> I'm<00:03:55.200> running<00:03:55.530> live<00:03:56.130> no<00:03:56.850> worries
