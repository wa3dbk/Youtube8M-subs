00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.500
 very good tablets that as you are 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.050
 here is what they are commenting and here we are 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.600
 in a good guide rather a tutorial 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.209
 for how to follow the sewing legacy 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.940
 the book this one wanted that in our 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.080
 cottage 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 we have to go to 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.510
 we have to go to reservations 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.060
 then from here to see where is 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.530
 we have to get the wool is the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.540
 half there is here 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.540
 we take the wool we buy it 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 like the ones you want later 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 and then there we go to planes and in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.160
 planes we create our our thread of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.420
 sewing and I'm looking for where they are 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.079
 to lose 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 serious 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.880
 since difficult where it connects 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.149
 here is fixed here is and what sewing 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.950
 remember that it is in materials there 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.970
 you have the seam you buy it what 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.659
 confirm if you already have the thread 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.070
 sewing 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.070
 and they agreed that you have to have 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.060
 to this girl at level 1 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 to helen I think it was the em 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 at level 1 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.399
 and nothing else to remember that in materials 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.240
 Sewing thread with this sewing thread 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.189
 you can make all this kind of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.289
 materials to have more arrows for 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.670
 we're going to have nicer than one for 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.310
 throw 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.520
 and a lot of little things you can have with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 this and well I hope you liked it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 this tutorial and that has been useful and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.549
 nothing to subscribe programs and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.549
