people call it it's not horseradish
this<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.220> horseradish<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.900> grow<00:00:33.080> horseradish

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
this is horseradish in grow horseradish

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.280 
this is horseradish in grow horseradish
in<00:00:33.860> your<00:00:33.980> garden<00:00:34.430> well<00:00:35.330> sabi<00:00:35.720> has<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:36.020> be<00:00:36.110> grown

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
in your garden well sabi has to be grown

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.500 
in your garden well sabi has to be grown
in<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.620> woods<00:00:37.360> it's<00:00:38.360> native<00:00:38.900> to<00:00:40.510> mountain

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
in the woods it's native to mountain

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.410 
in the woods it's native to mountain
streams<00:00:42.020> in<00:00:42.410> Japan<00:00:42.770> very<00:00:43.130> much<00:00:43.399> like<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:43.880> one

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
streams in Japan very much like this one

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.470 
streams in Japan very much like this one
so<00:00:45.020> wasabi<00:00:45.590> occurs<00:00:45.950> naturally<00:00:46.220> on<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.210> sides

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
so wasabi occurs naturally on the sides

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.450 
so wasabi occurs naturally on the sides
of<00:00:47.870> little<00:00:48.200> mountain<00:00:48.530> streams<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:49.309> like

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
of little mountain streams just like

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.620 
of little mountain streams just like
this<00:00:49.700> in<00:00:50.000> Japan<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.820> wants<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:53.239> grow<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.540> the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
this in Japan it wants to grow in the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.650 
this in Japan it wants to grow in the
mountains<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:55.190> wants<00:00:55.489> running<00:00:55.910> water<00:00:56.180> on<00:00:56.329> its

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
mountains it wants running water on its

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.440 
mountains it wants running water on its
roots<00:00:56.960> clean<00:00:57.500> running<00:00:57.770> water<00:00:57.920> not<00:00:58.579> over<00:00:58.969> fifty

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
roots clean running water not over fifty

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.200 
roots clean running water not over fifty
degrees<00:00:59.829> so<00:01:00.829> obviously<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:01.460> can't<00:01:01.730> be<00:01:01.820> grown

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
degrees so obviously it can't be grown

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.170 
degrees so obviously it can't be grown
in<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.600> great<00:01:02.780> part<00:01:03.020> of<00:01:03.200> this<00:01:03.320> country<00:01:04.180> strictly

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
a mountain plant so most of the wasabi

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.080 
a mountain plant so most of the wasabi
that<00:01:09.500> we<00:01:09.590> get<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.979> America<00:01:10.430> most<00:01:10.670> people<00:01:10.940> know

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090

the roots we submarket the leaves to
restaurants<00:01:36.800> people<00:01:37.640> think<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.030> wasabi<00:01:39.369> is

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
restaurants people think that wasabi is

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.859

doesn't it's actually not as strong as
horseradish<00:01:45.140> probably<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.640> has<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.819> very

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
horseradish probably but it has a very

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.139

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.339 
right circumstances for it easily grown
from<00:01:57.830> seed<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.610> right<00:01:59.390> down<00:01:59.569> here<00:01:59.959> you<00:02:00.110> can

these seedlings here we potted up a lot
of<00:02:10.789> them<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:11.150> sale

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
of them for sale

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.199 
of them for sale
the<00:02:14.120> seed<00:02:14.390> falls<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.170> ground<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
the seed falls on the ground and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.720 
the seed falls on the ground and
germinates<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.450> following<00:02:18.019> spring<00:02:18.579> needs<00:02:19.579> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
germinates the following spring needs a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.550 
germinates the following spring needs a
period<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> winter<00:02:20.569> cold<00:02:20.780> before<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.439> will

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
period of winter cold before it will

so<00:02:24.019> these<00:02:24.200> plants<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:25.629> probably<00:02:26.629> ten<00:02:26.840> years

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
so these plants are probably ten years

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.580 
so these plants are probably ten years
old

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
old

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.069 
old

it makes him gradually into a bigger and
