thing<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.050> can<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.970> well<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> best<00:01:51.360> thing

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
thing you can do well not the best thing

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.730 
thing you can do well not the best thing
the<00:01:51.720> best<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.080> do<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.440> pull<00:01:52.619> away

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the best thing to do is just pull away

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.480 
the best thing to do is just pull away
but<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> second<00:01:53.759> best<00:01:53.970> thing<00:01:55.490> he's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
but this is the second best thing he's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.199 
but this is the second best thing he's

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
does goes to complete after like

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.640 
does goes to complete after like
three<00:03:06.879> laps<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:07.959> easier<00:03:08.260> said<00:03:08.290> than

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
three laps but that's easier said than

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.399 
three laps but that's easier said than
done<00:03:08.709> cuz<00:03:09.129> apparently<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.639> get<00:03:09.790> past<00:03:10.030> like<00:03:10.239> a

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
done cuz apparently you get past like a

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.059 
done cuz apparently you get past like a
microsecond<00:03:11.409> you're<00:03:11.530> gone

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
microsecond you're gone

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.610 
microsecond you're gone
this<00:03:12.669> isn't<00:03:13.000> like<00:03:13.329> Jimmie<00:03:13.780> Johnson<00:03:14.230> got<00:03:14.379> as

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
this isn't like Jimmie Johnson got as

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.979 
this isn't like Jimmie Johnson got as
there<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.220> race<00:03:15.400> it's<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.180> he<00:03:16.419> never<00:03:16.750> got

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
there in the race it's not he never got

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.470 
there in the race it's not he never got
past<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> obviously<00:03:18.760> why<00:03:18.970> had<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.209> stay<00:03:19.389> ahead

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
past so obviously why had to stay ahead

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.449 
past so obviously why had to stay ahead
of<00:03:19.599> him<00:03:19.720> for<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.989> entire<00:03:20.109> damn<00:03:20.500> time<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.220> know

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
of him for the entire damn time you know

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.689 
of him for the entire damn time you know
I<00:03:21.699> got<00:03:22.510> four<00:03:22.840> lives<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.260> hang<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.889> think<00:03:24.609> we

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
I got four lives to hang on I think we

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.240 
I got four lives to hang on I think we
can<00:03:24.849> do<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:26.019> out<00:03:26.169> of<00:03:26.199> all<00:03:26.470> second<00:03:27.040> lead

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
can do it we out of all second lead

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.630 
can do it we out of all second lead
still

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
still

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.660 

so<00:03:30.300> we're<00:03:30.510> still<00:03:30.660> doing<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.020> right<00:03:31.670> we're

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
so we're still doing that right we're

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.420 
so we're still doing that right we're
still<00:03:32.880> doing<00:03:33.030> us<00:03:33.890> we're<00:03:34.890> actually<00:03:35.010> getting

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
still doing us we're actually getting

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.530 
still doing us we're actually getting
them<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:36.000> bit<00:03:36.120> are<00:03:36.210> we<00:03:36.330> maintaining

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
them a little bit are we maintaining

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.400 
them a little bit are we maintaining
three<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.380> go<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:39.660> don't<00:03:39.810> overshoot<00:03:40.140> any

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
three to go now just don't overshoot any

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.840 
three to go now just don't overshoot any
corners<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> think<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.280> got<00:03:41.460> this<00:03:41.670> I'll

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
corners and I think we got this I'll
