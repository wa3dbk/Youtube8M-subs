want to know if you're considering
buying<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.859> camera<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
buying the camera what it can do some of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.519 
buying the camera what it can do some of
the<00:00:25.430> potential<00:00:26.900> negatives<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the potential negatives and the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
the potential negatives and the
positives<00:00:28.560> from<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> camera<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
positives from the camera so one of the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.240 
positives from the camera so one of the
things<00:00:31.260> that's<00:00:31.500> kind<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
things that's kind of a little bit of a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
things that's kind of a little bit of a
negative<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.719> take<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> long<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
negative is it can take a long time to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
negative is it can take a long time to
wake<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.730> sleep<00:00:36.059> mode<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.079> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
wake up from sleep mode so it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
wake up from sleep mode so it's
something<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> might<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> disable

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
something that you might want to disable

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.569 
something that you might want to disable
in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.690> camera<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> sleep<00:00:40.860> function<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
in the camera is the sleep function and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
in the camera is the sleep function and
turn<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.329> quick<00:00:42.629> start<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
turn it over to quick start just so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
turn it over to quick start just so
you're<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.710> waiting<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.969> wake<00:00:45.149> up

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you're not waiting for it to wake up

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.330 
you're not waiting for it to wake up
when<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> goes<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> sleep<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:47.010> conserve

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
when it goes to sleep to conserve

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.510 
when it goes to sleep to conserve
battery<00:00:47.550> power<00:00:48.800> which<00:00:49.800> leads<00:00:50.100> us<00:00:50.250> into<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
battery power which leads us into the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
battery power which leads us into the
next<00:00:50.610> thing<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.320> least<00:00:52.350> one

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
next thing you want to have at least one

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
next thing you want to have at least one
extra<00:00:53.340> battery<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> few<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
extra battery if not a few because the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
extra battery if not a few because the
batteries<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.190> small<00:00:56.610> small<00:00:56.969> capacity<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
batteries are small small capacity and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
batteries are small small capacity and
the<00:00:58.109> camera<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.739> through<00:00:58.920> them<00:00:59.070> quite

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the camera can go through them quite

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
the camera can go through them quite
quickly<00:01:00.170> especially<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.379> using<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
quickly especially if you're using the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
so it's quick to focus but not always

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.349 
so it's quick to focus but not always
accurate<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.260> perhaps<00:03:40.709> three<00:03:41.700> or<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.150> low<00:03:42.299> to

five<00:03:42.750> shots<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.530> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.859> sharp<00:03:44.280> and

five shots are going to be sharp and

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.089 
five shots are going to be sharp and
then<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.480> other<00:03:45.630> two<00:03:45.989> might<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.650> focus

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
then the other two might be out of focus

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.460

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
or slightly out of focus maybe not just

to bear in mind there the image preview
if<00:03:56.130> if<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.819> have<00:03:56.940> an<00:03:57.030> image<00:03:57.359> up<00:03:57.569> on<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.079> LCD<00:03:58.560> on

if if you have an image up on the LCD on

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.699 
if if you have an image up on the LCD on
the<00:03:58.709> back<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.549> can<00:03:59.940> take<00:04:00.239> one<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.930> two<00:04:00.959> seconds

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
the back it can take one to two seconds

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.550 
the back it can take one to two seconds
or<00:04:01.829> so<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> delay<00:04:02.609> before<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.569> cameras<00:04:03.989> into

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
or so a delay before the cameras into

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.800 
or so a delay before the cameras into
shooting<00:04:05.340> mode<00:04:05.519> again<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.970> ready<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.329> capture

another photo so a little bit of a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
slight delay to do that you wouldn't

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.640
