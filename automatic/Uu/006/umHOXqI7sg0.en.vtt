00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
this time I'm looking up the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.930 
this time I'm looking up the
six-cylinder<00:00:13.410> Ito<00:00:14.389> 3.8<00:00:15.410> 4.2<00:00:16.640> you'll<00:00:17.640> notice

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
six-cylinder Ito 3.8 4.2 you'll notice

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.090 
six-cylinder Ito 3.8 4.2 you'll notice
off<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.680> six-cylinder<00:00:19.680> e-type

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
off of that a six-cylinder e-type

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.420 
off of that a six-cylinder e-type
mauricio<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.800> we're<00:00:22.800> making<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
mauricio so we're making it just a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.009 
mauricio so we're making it just a
little<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.730> easier<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.810> because

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
little bit easier for you to see because

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.570 
little bit easier for you to see because
as<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.859> tucked<00:00:26.340> under<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
as you know they are tucked under the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
as you know they are tucked under the
carburetors<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:28.680> start

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
carburetors so first of all I'll start

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.319 
carburetors so first of all I'll start
by<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> doing<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> we'll<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.250> there

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.540 

I'm<00:00:36.329> continuing<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> undo<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I'm continuing to undo this but the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
I'm continuing to undo this but the
point<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.910> forgot<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> mention<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.020> will

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
point I forgot to mention is there will

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
point I forgot to mention is there will
be<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.440> oil<00:00:40.590> dripping<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.550> underneath<00:00:41.879> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
be some oil dripping from underneath so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
be some oil dripping from underneath so
put<00:00:42.690> yourself<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.140> catch<00:00:43.320> tank<00:00:43.680> underneath<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
put yourself a catch tank underneath to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
put yourself a catch tank underneath to
catch<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> oil<00:00:45.620> right<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.430> your

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

a slightly squashed off

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.689 
a slightly squashed off
sometimes<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:55.250> but<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.370> nothing<00:00:56.610> to

sometimes they do but it's nothing to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
sometimes they do but it's nothing to
worry<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> spring<00:00:58.109> loaded

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
worry about because it is spring loaded

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.460 
worry about because it is spring loaded
in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> bottle<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:01.039> sure<00:01:02.149> dismantle<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
in the bottle now I sure dismantle this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.399 
in the bottle now I sure dismantle this
see<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> faults<00:01:05.360> you'll<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.260> or

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
see the faults you'll see this one or

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
see the faults you'll see this one or
two<00:01:07.530> parts<00:01:07.890> missing<00:01:08.310> which<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
two parts missing which is what you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
two parts missing which is what you
often<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:14.780> really<00:01:15.780> tight<00:01:16.049> bolt<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
often get really tight bolt there is a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.120 
often get really tight bolt there is a
rubber<00:01:17.100> seal<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> bottom<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.409> then

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
rubber seal on the bottom but also then

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
rubber seal on the bottom but also then
that<00:01:20.520> goes<00:01:20.759> inside<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.659> canister<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:23.960> then

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that goes inside the canister and then

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.070 
that goes inside the canister and then
you<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> spring<00:01:26.509> then<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.720> should<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you have a spring then there should be a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
you have a spring then there should be a
washer<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.009> felt<00:01:29.280> seal<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
washer and a felt seal to go on to the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
washer and a felt seal to go on to the
plate<00:01:32.450> which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.810> plate<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
plate which is this plate here which the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.749 
plate which is this plate here which the
filter<00:01:35.670> sits<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.560> shall<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.400> some

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
filter sits on so I shall just get some

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
filter sits on so I shall just get some
of<00:01:38.880> those<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.420> we'll<00:01:39.600> start<00:01:39.900> assembling

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of those and then we'll start assembling

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
of those and then we'll start assembling
after<00:01:41.340> dismantling<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> thoroughly

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

easy

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.090 

replace<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.940> with<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.180> brand<00:01:56.390> new<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:57.100> all

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
one is slightly thicker but it will

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.270 
one is slightly thicker but it will
squash<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:04.730> as<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.150> tightened<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:06.280> next

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
squash down as it is tightened up next

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.950 
squash down as it is tightened up next
thing<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.970> canister<00:02:08.509> on<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> top<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
thing is the canister on the top so the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.890 
thing is the canister on the top so the
next<00:02:12.140> thing<00:02:12.380> after<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.490> spring<00:02:14.120> it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
next thing after that is the spring it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.510 
next thing after that is the spring it
surprised<00:02:15.320> how<00:02:15.500> many<00:02:15.560> times<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.100> get<00:02:16.280> this

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
surprised how many times you get this

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.430 
surprised how many times you get this
these<00:02:16.910> filters<00:02:17.270> apart<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.900> find<00:02:18.020> somebody's

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
these filters apart and find somebody's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
these filters apart and find somebody's
left<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.740> spring<00:02:19.010> out<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.210> pop<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.510> in

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.670 

the<00:02:24.530> next<00:02:24.800> thing<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.670> plain<00:02:25.970> washer<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
the next thing is the plain washer it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.550 
the next thing is the plain washer it
goes<00:02:27.890> over<00:02:28.130> there<00:02:28.459> over<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> bolts<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.350> then

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
goes over there over the bolts and then

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.340 
goes over there over the bolts and then
that<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:30.920> followed<00:02:31.130> by<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:32.090> felt<00:02:32.420> seal<00:02:32.690> which

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
that is followed by the felt seal which

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.430 
that is followed by the felt seal which
is<00:02:34.209> usually<00:02:35.209> missing<00:02:35.450> totally<00:02:36.110> all<00:02:36.260> together

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
is usually missing totally all together

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.740 
is usually missing totally all together
so<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.459> slip<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.000> onto<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.390> top<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
so you slip that onto the top of the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.750 
so you slip that onto the top of the
bolt

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
bolt

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:50.500 
bolt
slip<00:02:40.760> your<00:02:40.790> plate<00:02:41.120> off<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:49.060> slice<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.180> go<00:02:50.240> find

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
slip your plate off I slice it go find

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:06.970 
slip your plate off I slice it go find

other we want the thin one so just pop

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.350 
other we want the thin one so just pop
it<00:03:31.730> straight<00:03:31.760> back<00:03:32.209> here

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.630 

just<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.470> eat<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.710> sink<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.220> into<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
just like that to eat a sink it into the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.230 
just like that to eat a sink it into the
bottom<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:42.140> refit<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.319> Pallister<00:03:44.240> push

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
bottom and then refit the Pallister push

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:54.920 
bottom and then refit the Pallister push
that<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:46.640> it'll<00:03:52.940> do<00:03:53.940> not<00:03:54.150> over<00:03:54.480> target<00:03:54.690> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
that in it'll do not over target and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.380 
that in it'll do not over target and
because<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:56.160> will<00:03:56.370> strip<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> threads<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:57.209> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
because it will strip the threads if you

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.220 
because it will strip the threads if you
get<00:03:57.630> carried<00:03:57.959> away

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
get carried away

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.670 
get carried away
it<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.400> needs<00:03:59.580> nipping<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:01.020> next<00:04:01.320> thing<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
it just needs nipping the next thing is

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.760 
it just needs nipping the next thing is
top<00:04:02.340> Kalenjin<00:04:02.640> up<00:04:02.940> with<00:04:03.150> oil<00:04:03.270> again<00:04:03.690> start<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
top Kalenjin up with oil again start the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.310 
top Kalenjin up with oil again start the
engine<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.370> check<00:04:05.550> for<00:04:05.580> leaks<00:04:06.000> and

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
engine and just check for leaks and

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.150 
engine and just check for leaks and
that's<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> job<00:04:07.680> done

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that's the job done

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.390 
that's the job done
so<00:04:08.400> simple

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.459
