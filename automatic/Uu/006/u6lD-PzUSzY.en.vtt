00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:14.459
 Here we have the LG G2 mini, it's the little brother or how I prefer to say the little 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:22.710
 sister of the flagship LG G2 that was released last year. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.460
 In contrast to the flagship, it is a middle class telephone, with just a little less 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 good specifications. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.430
 So if we compare it to the full size of the G2, it is of course a lot 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.489
 smaller. it has a 4.7 inch screen instead of a 5.2 inch screen. 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.370
 The processor is also slightly smaller, so this is a 1.2 Ghz quadcore processor instead 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 from a 2.2 Ghz quadcore processor. 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.850
 And the camera is also slightly less good, the larger version has a 13 megapixel camera and there 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.070
 now has an 8 megapixel camera. 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.429
 But there are also some advantages, the back is reduced and mini made, and the back 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.799
 is not attached so you can take it off and put more memory in it, and if 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.840
 if necessary, you can also replace the battery. 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.160
 As you probably expect from a mini version, it has shrunk in dimensions, so 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.910
 instead of a 5.2 inch screen you have a 4.7 inch screen. 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.000
 Just like his bigger brother, he has buttons on the back. so here you can handle it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.630
 and off and turn the volume up and down. 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.500
 Some people find it very useful and some people don't like it at all, I find it myself 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.850
 very handy because when I have it in my hand my fingers rest naturally there, so it 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.980
 is actually quite handy. 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.560
 And like I said, it has a 4.7 inch screen, which I actually think is pretty big for 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.290
 a mini version, if I hold it in one hand, my thumb can't go all the way across the screen 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 to move. but it doesn't seem too big. 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.620
 This actually just represents LG that follows the trend of brands such as Sony 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.920
 HTC and Samsung who have all brought mini versions of their flagship to the market. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.539
 The big advantage of this is that it is a cheaper mobile. 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.560
 The price is not yet known but the larger version costs 400 pounds and we expect that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.270
 it will be reasonably cheaper than that.
