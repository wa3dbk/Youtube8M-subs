00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:18.610
 In using the extraction instrument called Aero press, I would like to make a coffee 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:21.520
 Extract coffee using air pressure in relatively new extraction class 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.110
 Introduce a company 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.370
 Plunger 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.720
 Here is falling chamber 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.940
 I guess 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.010
 I am a pewter 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.010
 Aim to be able to cut coffee 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.829
 Easy 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.230
 And paper 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.450
 Hmm 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:49.470
 First, put the paper on the cap 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.470
 Then you set the cap in Northumberland 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.750
 Here in the coffee and weighing one 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.090

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 had 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:09.480
 This time , 17 g of sky of medium and thin animals 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.720
 This is about the same level as a paper machine. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.720
 Oh 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.920
 17 grams is 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.470
 If it is at home 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.470
 It is also possible to extract directly on a slightly firm mug like this 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 Let's try for the East 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.850
 The top is 180 then used 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.150
 Though I have a hospital of the plunger is per 1000 yen on the 4 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.690
 I will proceed to hot water slowly to the Sambar 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.600
 It is 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.600

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.319

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:03.609
 Please take about 20 seconds to 30 and push in one of them. 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.609
 At this time, it is extracted in the rear back and May home course 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.350
 Don't push too hard 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.130
 Shukureito politely 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.130

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.030
 This is completed 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.520

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.329
 Good singer day 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.329
 Masu Dakei as possible the 100 itself 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.750

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.100
 And I 'm a person on the battlefield but 1 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.910
 On budget 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 When the last to say 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.110
 It is off the water 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.130

 Coffee will close if you do so 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.240
 Let's get it 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.340
 Very short extraction time 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.190
 Firmly 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.440
 Finished with a taste of coffee 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.689
 Because I use a paper filter 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.219
 It also features a mouthfeel and a clear finish 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.219
