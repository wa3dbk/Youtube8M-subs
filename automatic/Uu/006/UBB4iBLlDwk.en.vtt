ds2<00:00:13.860> turbo<00:00:14.549> Distortion<00:00:15.470> it's<00:00:16.470> sort<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
ds2 turbo Distortion it's sort of a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.060 
ds2 turbo Distortion it's sort of a
follow-up<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.580> their<00:00:17.730> ds1<00:00:18.630> distortion<00:00:19.439> voiced

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
follow-up to their ds1 distortion voiced

follow-up to their ds1 distortion voiced
very<00:00:20.369> similarly<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.359> bit

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
very similarly but with a little bit

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.960 
very similarly but with a little bit
more<00:00:21.660> grit<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.740> bit<00:00:22.830> more<00:00:22.980> dirt<00:00:23.250> I'm

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
more grit and a little bit more dirt I'm

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.920 
more grit and a little bit more dirt I'm
gonna<00:00:24.090> start<00:00:24.240> off<00:00:24.390> letting<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> hear<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:24.900> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
gonna start off letting you hear what it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.420 
gonna start off letting you hear what it
sounds<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> knobs<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.310> at

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sounds like with all the knobs right at

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.029 
sounds like with all the knobs right at
12<00:00:26.640> o'clock<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.140> turbo<00:00:28.439> setting<00:00:28.769> on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
12 o'clock and the turbo setting on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:44.800 
12 o'clock and the turbo setting on
setting<00:00:29.699> one

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.300 

you<00:00:45.810> can<00:00:45.900> hear<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.410> pretty<00:00:47.070> similar

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
you can hear there it's pretty similar

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.400 
you can hear there it's pretty similar
to<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> ds1<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:49.170> raunch

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to a ds1 just a little little raunch

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
to a ds1 just a little little raunch
here<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.830> front<00:00:50.070> end<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:51.060> bit<00:00:51.150> more

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
here on the front end a little bit more

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.450 
here on the front end a little bit more
grit<00:00:51.540> from<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.810> diodes<00:00:52.200> as<00:00:53.040> you<00:00:53.190> push<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
grit from the diodes as you push the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.390 
grit from the diodes as you push the
tone<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> distortion<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:54.990> it<00:00:55.740> can<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.040> pretty

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
tone and distortion up it can get pretty

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.790 
tone and distortion up it can get pretty
raspy<00:00:57.270> though<00:00:57.720> show<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.470> sounds

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
raspy though show you what that sounds

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:20.560 
raspy though show you what that sounds
like<00:00:58.860> here

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.440 

now<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.810> thing<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.050> pedal<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.410> going<00:01:22.620> on<00:01:22.800> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
now one thing this pedal has going on is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
now one thing this pedal has going on is
two-level<00:01:24.450> settings<00:01:24.870> or<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> turbo<00:01:26.070> settings

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
two-level settings or the turbo settings

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.180 
two-level settings or the turbo settings
I<00:01:26.520> guess<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:27.870> much<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.410> pretty

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
I guess one is pretty much the pretty

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.300 
I guess one is pretty much the pretty
typical<00:01:29.550> ds1<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> voicing<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:32.040> two

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
typical ds1 kind of voicing the two

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.450 
typical ds1 kind of voicing the two
gives<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.300> of<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.510> peaked<00:01:33.840> mids<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
gives you kind of a peaked mids and it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.250 
gives you kind of a peaked mids and it
is<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:35.790> foot<00:01:36.240> switchable<00:01:36.690> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.930> plug

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
is actually foot switchable you can plug

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.630 
is actually foot switchable you can plug
a<00:01:37.290> remote<00:01:37.650> switch<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.220> there

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a remote switch in there

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.150 
a remote switch in there
and<00:01:38.730> it'll<00:01:39.690> kind<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> act<00:01:40.080> as<00:01:40.200> two<00:01:40.500> distortion

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
and it'll kind of act as two distortion

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.220 
and it'll kind of act as two distortion
boxes<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.730> one<00:01:41.940> I'll<00:01:42.720> let<00:01:42.870> you<00:01:42.960> hear<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
boxes in one I'll let you hear what that

00:01:43.230 --> 00:02:13.410 
boxes in one I'll let you hear what that
sounds<00:01:43.380> like

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.940 

see<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:14.659> there<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.050> quite<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.379> quite<00:02:15.920> a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
see here there you get quite a quite a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.190 
see here there you get quite a quite a
kick<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.400> mid<00:02:16.670> range<00:02:16.930> gives<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.989> sort<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
kick to the mid range gives you sort of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.710 
kick to the mid range gives you sort of
a<00:02:18.290> reverse<00:02:18.590> scoop<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.370> lot<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.209> sustained

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
a reverse scoop a lot more sustained

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.009 
a reverse scoop a lot more sustained
sort<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.670> turbo<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.599> kind<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.870> like

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
sort of the turbo to is kind of like

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.509 
sort of the turbo to is kind of like
what<00:02:24.170> you'd<00:02:24.260> use<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.620> soloing<00:02:25.010> kind<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> kick

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
what you'd use for soloing kind of kick

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.690 
what you'd use for soloing kind of kick
it<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.090> go<00:02:26.810> from<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:28.519> it'd

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
it on and go from there on the one it'd

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.309 
it on and go from there on the one it'd
be<00:02:28.940> more<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.239> kind<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.569> crunch<00:02:29.959> sort<00:02:30.260> of

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
be more of just kind of a crunch sort of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:42.890 
be more of just kind of a crunch sort of
power<00:02:30.500> chord<00:02:30.920> setting

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.850 

of<00:02:43.900> course<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.380> boost<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.770> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
of course with that boost in the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.470 
of course with that boost in the
mid-range<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.430> also<00:02:45.550> get<00:02:45.790> pretty<00:02:46.180> good<00:02:46.209> boost

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
mid-range you also get pretty good boost

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.110 
mid-range you also get pretty good boost
in<00:02:46.690> volume<00:02:47.069> or<00:02:48.069> at<00:02:48.160> least<00:02:48.280> perceived<00:02:48.700> volume

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
in volume or at least perceived volume

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.430 
in volume or at least perceived volume
and<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:51.250> pretty<00:02:51.430> much<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.030> ds2<00:02:52.540> turbo

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
and that's pretty much it the ds2 turbo

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.489 
and that's pretty much it the ds2 turbo
distortion<00:02:54.010> by<00:02:54.190> boss
