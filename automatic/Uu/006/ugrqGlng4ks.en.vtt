00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.980 

I<00:04:18.590> also<00:04:19.590> really<00:04:20.040> liked<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.430> without<00:04:20.670> the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:20.990 
I also really liked it without the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:26.900 
I also really liked it without the
sweater<00:04:21.990> -<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.890> still<00:04:26.130> pretty<00:04:26.310> warm<00:04:26.580> so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
sweater - and it is still pretty warm so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.180 
sweater - and it is still pretty warm so
she<00:04:26.970> could<00:04:27.240> probably<00:04:27.390> do<00:04:28.230> okay<00:04:28.590> with<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.950> as

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
she could probably do okay with that as

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:41.740 
she could probably do okay with that as
well

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.170 

so<00:04:42.750> her<00:04:43.139> hair<00:04:43.410> really<00:04:43.770> really<00:04:44.039> reminds<00:04:44.970> me<00:04:45.030> of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
so her hair really really reminds me of

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.559 
so her hair really really reminds me of
Ruthie's<00:04:45.780> hair<00:04:46.169> so<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:47.009> you<00:04:47.669> still<00:04:48.539> want

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
Ruthie's hair so if you still want

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.050 
Ruthie's hair so if you still want
Ruthie<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.259> you<00:04:49.590> didn't<00:04:49.889> get<00:04:50.130> her<00:04:50.340> before<00:04:50.580> she

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
Ruthie and you didn't get her before she

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.409 
Ruthie and you didn't get her before she

Girl and I think she is very very very
very<00:05:06.720> very<00:05:07.110> similar<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:08.210> Ruthie<00:05:09.210> Ruthie<00:05:10.020> did

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
very very similar to Ruthie Ruthie did

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.770 
very very similar to Ruthie Ruthie did
have<00:05:10.650> gray<00:05:10.919> eyes<00:05:11.220> but<00:05:11.729> these<00:05:12.210> green<00:05:12.599> eyes

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
have gray eyes but these green eyes

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.800 
have gray eyes but these green eyes
really<00:05:13.199> aren't<00:05:13.530> too<00:05:13.949> far<00:05:14.759> away<00:05:14.880> from<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.539> gray

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
really aren't too far away from the gray

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.680 
really aren't too far away from the gray
although<00:05:16.349> they<00:05:16.500> are<00:05:16.620> different<00:05:17.160> but<00:05:18.150> overall

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
although they are different but overall

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.600 
although they are different but overall
I<00:05:18.870> really<00:05:19.199> think<00:05:19.590> she<00:05:19.770> looks<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.130> lot<00:05:20.310> like

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
I really think she looks a lot like

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.719 
I really think she looks a lot like
Ruthie<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.419> if<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:22.259> put<00:05:22.560> her<00:05:22.770> in<00:05:25.490> if<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.699> put

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
Ruthie and if you put her in if you put

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.290 
Ruthie and if you put her in if you put
her<00:05:27.030> in<00:05:27.270> Ruthie's<00:05:28.050> maid<00:05:28.770> outfit<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.580> bet<00:05:30.120> she

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
her in Ruthie's maid outfit I bet she

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.029 
her in Ruthie's maid outfit I bet she
would<00:05:30.419> look<00:05:30.539> really<00:05:31.320> really<00:05:31.590> similar<00:05:31.860> to

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
would look really really similar to

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.290 
would look really really similar to
Ruthie<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.550> most<00:05:32.820> people<00:05:33.060> would<00:05:33.180> probably

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
Ruthie and most people would probably

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200 
Ruthie and most people would probably
think<00:05:33.509> she<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:33.990> Ruthie<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.729> is<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.060> a

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
think she is Ruthie so that is just a

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.510 
think she is Ruthie so that is just a
suggestion<00:05:36.570> if<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.199> really<00:05:38.009> wanted<00:05:38.280> earthy

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
suggestion if you really wanted earthy

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.100 
suggestion if you really wanted earthy
but<00:05:38.669> didn't<00:05:39.030> have<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.180> chance<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.659> get<00:05:39.870> her

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
but didn't have a chance to get her

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.879 
but didn't have a chance to get her
before<00:05:40.740> she<00:05:41.330> archived<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:43.259> is<00:05:43.440> definitely

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
before she archived that is definitely

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.050 
before she archived that is definitely
an<00:05:44.070> option<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.820> then<00:05:45.710> also<00:05:46.710> her<00:05:47.460> hair<00:05:47.759> is<00:05:48.030> a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
an option and then also her hair is a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.100 
an option and then also her hair is a
bit<00:05:48.360> challenging

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
bit challenging

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.499 
bit challenging
