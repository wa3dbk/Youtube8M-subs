00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
 These sun engines step by step 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 this even very common but little known 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.259
 the embryo that as discarding material to sink this technology 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.569
 It would come in handy because these stepper motorcycles that are in almost 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:19.659
 all those that are 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.009
 they are a powerful earthquake 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.879
 and it has some qualities that makes it even better that a dynamo be a 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.499
 electricity generator 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.989
 no less interesting that it occurs is that it is not necessary 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.070
 that this is continuously rotating 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 just move it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.970
 we are generating the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.250
 energy for any side 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 As you can see, there are eight goals by Arjen Robben and the first 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 all right 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.240
 and you do not need a tour with just 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.020
 move with passing the finger on the axis 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020
 and generate electricity 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.810
 has already rectified podiums and transistors 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
 and applying it to little step the light is going to take continued 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.970
 this is what I would define as a portable kobe camp stand 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.720
 when I turn here I will have light continuously 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.750
 depending on the capacitor capacity 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.420
 it will be at the time when the tiles of the population 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 in this case it can last about fifteen or twenty seconds but 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 with a very large capacitor can be achieved 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.990
 fourteen or fifteen minutes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.299
 good we'll see what happens ashes motorcito step by step 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.180
 white 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 the intention to move 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 a kinetic rotor 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.810
 in this case a symmetric rotor experiences fourth ice storms 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 and sixth 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.660
 on base as 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.320
 a motor 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.330
 Photocopier 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 what without the particularity of having the young girl 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.490
 in a plane 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.000
 very different 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.850
 alder the engine authors said gillard hours 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.270
 a draft sentence 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.709
 here we have it in such a position 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.129
 what can we literally apply in ethics 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.629
 then in this flyer 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.109
 what we have done has been to add 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.709
 to its contour 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.470
 ll a little more and unethical using a material in this case is a kind of 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.359
 very thin plastic 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.539
 How little for all this space too 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539
 we carry 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:39.579
 let's see what happens about peaks and mexico afp
