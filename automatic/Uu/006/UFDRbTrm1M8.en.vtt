00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone, svetlana good 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.649
 to my channel today i 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.750
 I will speak again the reproduction of the violet 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.799
 a lot of lovers of indoor 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.960
 flowers complain that you are very much to them 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.490
 hard to plant violets that they do not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.269
 It turns out that the leaves do not rot 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 rooted some problems I will say 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.210
 you of course this is a difficult matter difficult 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 because it all needs to learn 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 you need to do this several times and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 need to be friends with this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.469
 by plant 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.739
 to grow a Christmas tree you need to go 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.940
 after several stages of loss 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.250
 experiences no matter how much you don't 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.739
 I had to if you really want you all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 still achieve your result i 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 talked a lot about rooting 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 Fiala about the transfer of such babies 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 violets and minifee shops and want today 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.229
 a little stop rooting 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.930
 water leaves 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.450
 rooting a violet leaf in water 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.869
 the easiest way so how can you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.659
 observe the appearance of the roots immediately 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.079
 can control this process and 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.969
 but first I want to stop a little 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.700
 what a difficult way does baby 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.770
 violets like when when she appears on 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.909
 the light and how to set it right 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.850
 so that she quickly came to light 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.219
 here I have a violet in a zip package about 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.979
 this I stopped here on this 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.340
 An example of this cup here I want 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.969
 show all the same as the violet grows and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.810
 where it grows and how much it needs 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:56.479
 do babes time so she 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.280
 grown many should know that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.159
 Realistic Violet Roots 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 one and a half to two months depending on 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.640
 what sort of 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.569
 and that's when the roots appear 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.880
 we rooted after two months 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.880
 then we wait we begin to wait for the children 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 here this leaf was groove 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:28.390
 and my wife 15 11 is November 15th all 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.350
 today is February 19 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.220
 here comes the baby and see the light 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.850
 with a leaf was planted to the end of the cup 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.390
 here is a long stalk and how hard 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.660
 baby goes to the bottom of the cutting and to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.600
 she needs to get through this all 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.940
 a centimeter and this whole land she needs 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.940
 punch if there was some land here 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.930
 so much now that already would have been seen 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.810
 that our little violet 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.360
 came to light after all this earth 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.030
 a lot do not be afraid a little land then you can 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.370
 there will be a cup neatly this is all with 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.130
 cup raise to the bottom 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.640
 land this up lift and she continues 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.950
 further grow you do not break anything there 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.550
 so the most important rule is always 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.550
 petiole sediment and shallow 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.270
 on places of a violet and so a leaf a leaf 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.120
 when you put some water 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.180
 I took the cup for clarity to 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.450
 it was visible well but when you bet 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.230
 my wand in some kind of dish with me 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.840
 This leaf was in such a jar 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.080
 there is he did not get to the bottom and so 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.620
 rested a petiole to the bottom lacked and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.570
 roots so here they grew today 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.390
 it's time to plant this leaf yet 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.520
 I want to show the leaf he of course 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.200
 began to spoil here it is now rotting 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.750
 I lift the che part of the need 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:29.070
 can be cut and here I want to show 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.860
 roots that let Fialochka leaf 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.200
 fellochka without stem 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.040
 that is, she has broken off from the leaf and 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.370
 this one 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.680
 the stem is gone and here I am it just 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.140
 put in some water on the bottom of the cup and 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.780
 These are the roots here, it requested the 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.120
 there is if you have no stems here 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.050
 such leaves are accidentally broken off 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.020
 or even from the half here are the quarters 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.450
 can they be planted immediately in the ground or 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.550
 put some water even if you want and here 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.170
 such a spine they let and then 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.540
 sit down 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.350
 This confirms that the leaves without 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.870
 petiole 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.660
 fragment they are pretty good too 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.550
 takes root that is sits fragments 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.320
 sheet 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.800
 this has already been told a lot and 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:21.720
 showing me already cooked 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:26.160
 substrate substrate for violets this 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.720
 perlite peat and chopped flies nicely i 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:35.520
 I take a glass of 100 g to the bottom 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.970
 I pour a little bit of the mixture I take a leaf with 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.840
 spine here and so neat it here 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.970
 get on 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.360
 and sprinkle it a little 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.669
 about half a centimeter 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.120
 so baby quickly quickly 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:06:00.790
 was born so she did not need 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:04.710
 pass such a huge height for 2 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.710
 leaf, I'll take a cup smaller 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.310
 filling in 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.310
 full cup 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:21.060
 I make a small recess and leaf 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:27.479
 neatly 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.479
 I drift shallowly 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.050
 here and so about the sheet will be planted 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:54.220
 Now these leaves of course need a little 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:07:01.260
 again, do not pour at all 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:04.810
 slightly wetted and if you 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:08.880
 apartment humidity is warm and humid 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.920
 they leave these cups with leaves 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.400
 no greenhouses do not put if u 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.300
 you are very dry here of course put 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.660
 for a week 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.120
 these leaves are in a greenhouse or in a zip package and 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.880
 and then look for a week on 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.930
 their behavior here is if they are good themselves 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:32.940
 feel that means they will continue 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:37.500
 grow further thank you all for your attention 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.500
 all until we meet again
