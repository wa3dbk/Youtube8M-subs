00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 creation of a simple volume encounters 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.639
 let's work next with dynamic disks 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.160
 So far all the operations that we have done 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.139
 we made them with basic discs 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.260
 remember 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.850
 that dynamic disks 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.200
 are used in active environments where, for reasons of infrastructure, it is 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280
 necessary to make a variation 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.179
 a little 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.010
 p let's say 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.890
 more fluid of him 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.060
 the capabilities of the partitions entities in this case instead of partitions we're going 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.190
 to talk volumes 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.800
 the volumes as we will see next 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.910
 we are here really a simple volume later we will see what can be 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 do with these volumes and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 for volume creation 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 entel simple volume we will use the administrative tool of disks that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.500
 provides us windows 7 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.090
 increased output directly from the start 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.239
 we would go to the right button type 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.430
 manage 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.230
 I already have to alert 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.170
 and let's see what 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910
 is what we have input and in this is the disk teques the system disk 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.730
 remember this other terrestrial disc 1 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.980
 is the disc of three that we have silenced enabled for the practices this 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.390
 default disk is a basic disk 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 like everything we're going to create now based on its dynamic disks 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 what we are going to do is convert this disc that is more economical 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 be there we right click on that area 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 and we select the option to become discord 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.650
 I do not know what what discs we want to turn into dynamic in case we have 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.060
 convert more than one disc at a time we say we only want 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.490
 convert the disk 1 corporation we will stop selected 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.490
 disc 1 and we accept 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.920
 as soon as we have done that we see how he brought from disk 'a dynamic seems that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.030
 say that this disc is already being made on dynamic disk what 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.609
 let's do from now on in this area will become volumes 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.400
 to create a simple volume as simple as right clicking on 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.180
 that area and they selected to put it or simple volume them to an assistant of what 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.900
 what we are going to do is follow the steps 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.750
 here he asks us that when he assaulted volume then for example I will have 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109
 a volume that is of mining companies 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:13.969
 next stage decide we ask if the king we want is to win it as 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.879
 assigned to the president or we can expect one of those we have available 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.870
 os for example let's leave there in the next letter let's touch nothing else 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.529
 and after files that type ede this Tuesday we will use for the 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.319
 volume 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.530
 is by default we will use in etfs remember that the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.150
 in patita 38 file systems that will be available in the limitation 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 that the volumes that are low systems later are going to be real and 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.609
 to mention 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.949
 so the others by default we will choose ntfs volume label by 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.949
 example selective master we can not put the euromed label that we were 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.790
 we remember that the volume label should do something derogatory of the 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.999
 content of the act 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.239
 and percent 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.090
 to finish what we have here is a summary of everything we have 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.919
 selected we give you to finalize 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.919
 and will create us the first volume sic 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.249
 team has created the single volume volume that is a volume 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.169
 one hundred per hundred thousand megabytes in mp3 c format with tag 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.829
 one 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.109
 this volume has been created for me here 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.650
 6 appears here 1 is a volume of a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650
 point 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.799
 now we have two tours available to show and defend with rubber and that 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.569
 these patients not simple volume this we marry peru 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.379
 a volume of 5 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.619
 the same 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.019
 we could see change the letter remember that sume no problem 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.429
 we keep putting the pp is in this case let's put 2 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.539
 digital 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:13.319
 and in chachapoyas a partition of the pp shows the pp we are to create 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.270
 percent 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.569
 the parts 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.349
 chatwood synchronism the uci people that cost you 4 700 megabytes 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.569
 the same things a silver the next day kinetic eta we change it we oppose 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.680
 press 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.930
 update we can vary this with the ppt systems file i chose pp people 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.039
 it's different drive letters labels 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.379
 p before shocks 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.509
 you can experiment with this 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.909
 up to these papers 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.909
 the process takes out other points 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.809
 this fourth 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.900
 and now we have a hidden immunity with the rest of the parties 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.919
 porsche 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.289
 are the ones that appear with a simple does not share that in primary as in their 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.490
 profile otero 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.650
 by the color code here we have a golden color 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.949
 percent in the five parties are printed volumes 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.139
 trim 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.349
 per cent as it is about equine dynamic volumes and partition of 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.759
 no type 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.189
 why I'm here 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.249
 the master's party 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.680
 and you see how 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.039
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.369
 those units 1 2 3 4 and 5 do not look like communities 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.319
 dynamic vespone dynamic volume that looks like it's a dynamic disk 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.330
 this part the volumes that on this disk but no 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.740
 moment it seems a distribution of the units 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.360
 remembering that when we talked about the basic percent discs there was a 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.660
 top of the meet four primary shot from there all that 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.059
 I had motions that are practiced is logical 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:18.879
 and meats sea of â€‹â€‹records when we want 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.860
 percent they seem primary species be it by 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.740
 omission 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.819
 the day after the inmates created logical and created peace in this entity 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.820
 here the extended valuations because you remembered alcaraz of volumes 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.690
 It is a dynamic disc and they allowed us enough volumes 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.610
 theorists who were 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.210
 interns volumes 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.199
 i practice enough to not have to used here you have a 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.499
 by 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.590
 and that would be everything concerning 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.130
