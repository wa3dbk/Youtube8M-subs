and<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.170> white<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.660> new<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.930> 2010<00:00:28.560> i'll<00:00:28.680> start

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and a white and new for 2010 i'll start

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 
and a white and new for 2010 i'll start
with<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> engine<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.050> change<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> number

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
with the engine so we change the number

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
with the engine so we change the number
of<00:00:31.650> things<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.759> improve<00:00:33.120> engine

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
of things to to improve engine

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.950 
of things to to improve engine
performance<00:00:34.610> especially<00:00:35.610> low<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.540> mid<00:00:36.690> range

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
performance especially low to mid range

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
performance especially low to mid range
and<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.980> throttle<00:00:38.309> response<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and the throttle response and at the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
and the throttle response and at the
same<00:00:39.899> time<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.350> reduced<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> noise<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> let<00:00:42.570> me

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
same time we reduced the noise so let me

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.810 
same time we reduced the noise so let me
start<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> air<00:00:43.170> filter<00:00:43.610> remove<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> air

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
intake air boot into the carburetor it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
intake air boot into the carburetor it's
an<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.829> new<00:00:53.010> carburetor<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> more<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
an all new carburetor that has a more of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.110 
an all new carburetor that has a more of
a<00:00:54.360> venturi<00:00:54.780> shape<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.460> carburetor

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a venturi shape to the the carburetor

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
a venturi shape to the the carburetor
throat<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> intake

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
throat and from there into the intake

throat and from there into the intake
the<00:01:00.949> intake<00:01:01.949> camshaft<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.730> been<00:01:02.910> changed<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the intake camshaft has been changed the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
the intake camshaft has been changed the
left<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.439> slightly<00:01:04.769> increased<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> valve

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
left is slightly increased so the valve

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.950 
left is slightly increased so the valve
opens<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.510> little<00:01:07.170> bit<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.930> along<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
opens a little bit more and along with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.670 
opens a little bit more and along with
that<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.770> changed<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:12.290> valvetrain<00:01:13.290> mass

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that we have changed the valvetrain mass

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
that we have changed the valvetrain mass
by<00:01:14.010> changing<00:01:14.460> sofia<00:01:14.729> valve<00:01:15.060> retainers<00:01:15.600> from

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
by changing sofia valve retainers from

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.380 
by changing sofia valve retainers from
steel<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.350> aluminum<00:01:16.860> along<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> new

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
steel to aluminum along with the new

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
steel to aluminum along with the new
intake<00:01:19.110> camshaft<00:01:19.380> we've<00:01:19.950> changed<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> valve

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
intake camshaft we've changed the valve

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.630 
intake camshaft we've changed the valve
spring<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> both<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> inlet<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> exhaust

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
spring on both the inlet and the exhaust

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.770 
spring on both the inlet and the exhaust
valves<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.500> reduced<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.240> weight<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
valves so we reduced the weight of the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
valves so we reduced the weight of the
valve<00:01:28.020> retainers<00:01:28.920> we've<00:01:29.130> changed<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.549> from

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
valve retainers we've changed them from

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
valve retainers we've changed them from
steel<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> aluminium<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.159> by<00:01:32.159> doing<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
steel to aluminium and by doing that we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
steel to aluminium and by doing that we
could<00:01:33.060> reduce<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.650> tension<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> valve

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
could reduce the tension of the valve

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
could reduce the tension of the valve
springs<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.920> reduces<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.189> amount<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.210> load

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
springs which reduces the amount of load

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
springs which reduces the amount of load
it<00:01:39.479> takes<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.590> spin<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> camshaft<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it takes two to spin the camshaft so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
it takes two to spin the camshaft so
more<00:01:42.180> throttle<00:01:42.570> response<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.259> low<00:01:43.380> rpm<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
more throttle response at low rpm a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
more throttle response at low rpm a
little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.030> quicker<00:01:45.240> revving<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.860> from

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
little bit quicker revving and from

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
little bit quicker revving and from
there<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.759> also<00:01:47.909> change<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> shape<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
there we also change the shape of the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
there we also change the shape of the
exhaust<00:01:49.229> port<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.159> from<00:01:50.340> us<00:01:50.720> oval

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
exhaust port it's going from us oval

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
exhaust port it's going from us oval
shape<00:01:52.729> ports<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.909> addie<00:01:54.210> shape<00:01:54.680> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
shape ports to addie shape so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.149 
shape ports to addie shape so
that<00:01:57.460> into<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.060> exhaust<00:01:58.270> system<00:01:59.039> the<00:02:00.039> new

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
that into the exhaust system the new

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.240 
that into the exhaust system the new
silencer<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:00.939> mid<00:02:01.270> pipe<00:02:01.679> we've<00:02:02.679> reduced<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
silencer and mid pipe we've reduced the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.480 
silencer and mid pipe we've reduced the
sound<00:02:03.729> by<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.179> couple<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.569> DB<00:02:04.899> as<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:06.100> smaller

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
sound by a couple of DB as a smaller

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.699 
sound by a couple of DB as a smaller
outlet<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:08.849> overall<00:02:10.110> improved<00:02:11.110> engine<00:02:11.349> power

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
outlet and overall improved engine power

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.369 
outlet and overall improved engine power
and<00:02:11.980> less<00:02:12.160> noise<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.810> they're<00:02:13.930> moving<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> the

bi-lateral beam frame and this new frame

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.059 
bi-lateral beam frame and this new frame
has<00:02:27.459> very<00:02:27.790> similar<00:02:28.030> vertical<00:02:28.870> rigidity<00:02:29.349> but

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
has very similar vertical rigidity but

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.610 
has very similar vertical rigidity but

slightly higher the foot pegs slightly

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.580 
slightly higher the foot pegs slightly
higher<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:09.340> forward<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.900> again<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.139> trying

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
higher and forward so again just trying

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.410 
higher and forward so again just trying
to<00:03:11.680> put<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.859> writer<00:03:12.160> closer<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.180> front<00:03:13.299> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
to put the writer closer to the front of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.670 
to put the writer closer to the front of
the<00:03:13.480> machine<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:13.959> he's<00:03:14.109> over<00:03:14.349> top<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the machine so he's over top of the

of<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.510> machine<00:03:16.599> is<00:03:16.989> shorter<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.130> we've

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
of the machine is shorter so we've

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.910 
of the machine is shorter so we've
changed<00:03:18.870> we've<00:03:19.870> given<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.139> more<00:03:20.290> trail<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
changed we've given it more trail and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.240 
changed we've given it more trail and
slightly<00:03:21.549> more<00:03:21.819> Custer<00:03:22.269> angle<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.620> maintain
