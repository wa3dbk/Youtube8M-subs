BMWs<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.849> think<00:00:12.599> it's<00:00:12.780> probably<00:00:12.960> enough<00:00:13.440> unfair

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
BMWs I think it's probably enough unfair

comment really because the end of the

comment really because the end of the
day<00:00:17.850> these<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.810> very<00:00:19.109> good<00:00:19.439> vehicles<00:00:20.070> should

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
day these are very good vehicles should

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.420 
day these are very good vehicles should
not<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.910> underestimated<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.170> if<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
not be underestimated at all if it was a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.689 
not be underestimated at all if it was a
choice<00:00:23.730> between<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.240> x5<00:00:24.689> will<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> x3

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
choice between the x5 will the x3

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
choice between the x5 will the x3
obviously<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> x5<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.420> come<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.869> top<00:00:28.109> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
obviously the x5 will come up on top but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.080 
obviously the x5 will come up on top but
these<00:00:29.039> vehicles<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> drive<00:00:29.760> different

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
these vehicles of the drive different

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.650 
these vehicles of the drive different
purposes<00:00:30.710> differences<00:00:31.710> may<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:31.890> subtle<00:00:32.660> but

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
purposes differences may be subtle but

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.020 
purposes differences may be subtle but
there<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> valid<00:00:34.230> point<00:00:34.559> though<00:00:35.030> first

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there was a valid point though first

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
there was a valid point though first

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
thing I'd like to pick up on is the side

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.240 
thing I'd like to pick up on is the side
mirrors<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> vehicle<00:00:39.649> they<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.680> very

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
large very wide and do a damn good job a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.650 
large very wide and do a damn good job a
lot<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.920> cars<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.969> adequate<00:00:48.300> wing

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
lot of cars don't have adequate wing

mirrors<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.440> great<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> rearview

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
mirrors these are great the rearview

vision<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.230> narrow<00:00:52.620> window<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
vision it's a very narrow window and I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
vision it's a very narrow window and I
personally<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:55.980> some

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
personally think that if you had some

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.709 
personally think that if you had some
very<00:00:56.309> tall<00:00:56.579> people<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> back<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> car

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
very tall people in the back of the car

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
very tall people in the back of the car
you<00:00:58.320> wouldn't<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.649> able<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you wouldn't be able to see out of the

the<00:01:10.909> instrument<00:01:11.909> cluster<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:13.460> pretty<00:01:14.460> easy<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the instrument cluster is pretty easy to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
the instrument cluster is pretty easy to
read<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.840> obstructed<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.560> any<00:01:16.680> way

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
read and it's not obstructed in any way

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.539 
read and it's not obstructed in any way
by<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> steering<00:01:17.909> wheel<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> speedo<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
by the steering wheel the speedo you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
by the steering wheel the speedo you
know<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:20.909> pretty<00:01:21.060> small<00:01:21.420> dials<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
know they're pretty small dials but I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
know they're pretty small dials but I
think<00:01:22.530> they've<00:01:22.650> kept<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.040> small<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
think they've kept them small so they

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
think they've kept them small so they
don't<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.119> lots<00:01:24.420> per<00:01:24.689> top<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> steering

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
