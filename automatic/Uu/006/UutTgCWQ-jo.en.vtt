present the fan theory search okay I
want<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> talk<00:00:22.230> about<00:00:22.380> why<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.490> so

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
obsessed with doing all these theories

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
obsessed with doing all these theories
that<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> especially<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.810> Pixar

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that have to do especially with Pixar

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609

and for me it all comes down to coming

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.950 
and for me it all comes down to coming
up<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.610> backstory<00:00:33.390> and

potential<00:00:34.590> connections<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.430> changes<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> way

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
potential connections it changes the way

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
potential connections it changes the way
that<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.780> watched<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> movies<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:38.610> how

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that I watched the movies I mean how

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
that I watched the movies I mean how
many<00:00:38.850> movies<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.600> watch<00:00:39.690> where<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> are

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
many movies do you watch where you are

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369 
many movies do you watch where you are
so<00:00:40.770> actively<00:00:41.370> engaged<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.350> everything<00:00:43.350> like

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so actively engaged with everything like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
so actively engaged with everything like
any<00:00:43.860> tiny<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.760> toy<00:00:45.090> sitting<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> shelf

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
any tiny little toy sitting on a shelf

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
any tiny little toy sitting on a shelf
could<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> connection<00:00:47.160> between<00:00:47.610> two

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
could be the connection between two

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
could be the connection between two
movies<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.379> excited

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
movies that would get to get all excited

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.479 
movies that would get to get all excited
about<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.610> entire<00:00:50.910> theory<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.480> over

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
about make an entire theory just over

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.590 
about make an entire theory just over
exaggerating<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.670> important<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> little

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
exaggerating how important that little

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
exaggerating how important that little
thing<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.170> been<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.949> love<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
thing could have been and just love that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.389 
thing could have been and just love that
Pixar<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.530> done<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.899> can

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
Pixar is just so well done that we can

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
Pixar is just so well done that we can
construct<00:01:02.399> these<00:01:03.000> theories<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.539> find

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
construct these theories and find

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.080 
construct these theories and find
something<00:01:04.409> fun<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.129> tie<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.670> point<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> point

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
something fun to tie from point to point

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
something fun to tie from point to point
like<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.229> trying<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like right now we're all trying to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.670 
like right now we're all trying to
figure<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.040> who<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.909> Emma<00:01:09.240> Jean<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
figure out who is Emma Jean can you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
figure out who is Emma Jean can you
imagine<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.110> see

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
imagine all of us going out to see

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
imagine all of us going out to see
inside<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> first<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
inside out for the first time in that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.649 
inside out for the first time in that
moment<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.740> screen<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.970> say<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
moment if on screen they say that the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.140 
moment if on screen they say that the
mothers<00:01:18.990> name<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.619> Emma<00:01:21.140> like<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.740> know

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
mothers name is Emma like you know

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
mothers name is Emma like you know
everybody<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.420> watches<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.229> channel

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
everybody that watches on this channel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640 
everybody that watches on this channel
would<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.580> absolutely<00:01:27.140> ballistic<00:01:28.140> like

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
would just go absolutely ballistic like

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
would just go absolutely ballistic like
their<00:01:28.860> bee<00:01:29.070> gasps<00:01:29.909> through<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> theater<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
their bee gasps through the theater and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.010 
their bee gasps through the theater and
probably<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.579> Gasper<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.689> every

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
probably more like a Gasper like every

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.800 
probably more like a Gasper like every
30<00:01:34.439> years<00:01:34.560> based<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.180> number<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> people

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
30 years based on the number of people

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
30 years based on the number of people
that<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.650> current<00:01:37.890> hunt<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.369> Emma

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that are in the current hunt for Emma

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.810 
that are in the current hunt for Emma
Jean<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.720> cool<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.400> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
Jean but how cool would it be like you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
Jean but how cool would it be like you
would<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.270> something<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.229> movie

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
would see something about that movie

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
would see something about that movie
that<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.070> everybody<00:01:44.640> else<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.090> audience

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that to everybody else in the audience

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.630 
that to everybody else in the audience
it<00:01:45.780> means<00:01:46.020> absolutely<00:01:46.259> nothing<00:01:46.829> sure<00:01:47.430> her

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it means absolutely nothing sure her

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
it means absolutely nothing sure her
name's<00:01:47.880> Emma<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> us<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.810> know

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
name's Emma but to us we're like we know

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
name's Emma but to us we're like we know
what<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.500> means<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.399> let's<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:53.909> ahead

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
what that means so let's just go ahead

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
what that means so let's just go ahead
and<00:01:54.119> dive<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> most

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and dive right on into one of the most

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
and dive right on into one of the most
suggested<00:01:57.030> fan<00:01:57.299> theories<00:01:57.719> from<00:01:57.899> last<00:01:58.140> week

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
suggested fan theories from last week

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.249 
suggested fan theories from last week
and<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.310> Emma<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.540> short<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and that is that Emma is just short for

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130 
and that is that Emma is just short for
Emily<00:02:02.250> who<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> channel<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.540> assume<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
Emily who on this channel we assume to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
Emily who on this channel we assume to
be<00:02:04.350> Andy's<00:02:05.009> mother<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> original<00:02:06.329> owner

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
be Andy's mother in the original owner

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.169 
be Andy's mother in the original owner
of<00:02:06.930> Jessie<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:07.890> try<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> build<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.789> theory

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of Jessie so let's try to build a theory

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.120 
of Jessie so let's try to build a theory
around<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
around that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.390 
around that
we<00:02:10.490> know<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.450> both<00:02:11.630> Emily<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.500> Andy<00:02:13.190> are

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
we know that both Emily and Andy are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000 
we know that both Emily and Andy are
very<00:02:13.840> interested<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.870> kind<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.680> cowboy

very interested in kind of that cowboy

very interested in kind of that cowboy
life<00:02:16.670> now<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.930> probably

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
life now we can see that that probably

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
life now we can see that that probably
was<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.770> passion<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> his<00:02:19.610> mother<00:02:19.880> had<00:02:20.150> that

in<00:03:23.390> Andy's<00:03:23.840> room<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.350> why<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.590> could<00:03:24.950> be<00:03:25.010> there

booze mother the theory ignites from the
fact<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.220> we<00:03:37.400> believe<00:03:37.580> there<00:03:38.060> could<00:03:38.360> in<00:03:38.600> fact

be<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.230> third<00:03:39.740> sister<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.610> we<00:03:41.030> never<00:03:41.240> actually

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
be a third sister and we never actually

be a third sister and we never actually
meet<00:03:42.200> booze<00:03:42.650> mother

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
meet booze mother

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.370 
meet booze mother
although<00:03:43.580> boo<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.060> not<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.480> redhead<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.110> think

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
although boo is not a redhead I think

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.080 
although boo is not a redhead I think
that<00:03:45.500> can<00:03:45.620> easily<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.160> explained<00:03:46.610> from<00:03:46.850> her

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
that can easily be explained from her

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390 
that can easily be explained from her
father's<00:03:47.600> genetics<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.440> there<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.680> one<00:03:49.010> hint

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
of Toy Story 3 there are some theories

of Toy Story 3 there are some theories
that<00:04:17.780> suggest<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.290> we<00:04:18.440> actually<00:04:18.590> see<00:04:19.100> Boo

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
that suggest that we actually see Boo

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.530 
that suggest that we actually see Boo
herself<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.960> day

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
herself in the day

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.720 
herself in the day
in<00:04:21.780> Toy<00:04:22.170> Story<00:04:22.560> 3<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.220> very<00:04:23.310> difficult

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
in Toy Story 3 but it's very difficult

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.180 
in Toy Story 3 but it's very difficult
to<00:04:23.910> say<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.660> definitively<00:04:25.290> boo<00:04:25.770> now

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
to say that that is definitively boo now

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.960 
to say that that is definitively boo now
what<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.850> say<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:28.110> boo<00:04:28.680> does<00:04:29.340> look<00:04:29.760> a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
what we can say is that boo does look a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.180 
what we can say is that boo does look a
lot<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.780> Bonnie<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.770> could<00:04:32.010> be<00:04:32.040> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
lot like Bonnie so it could be that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.480 
lot like Bonnie so it could be that
bonnie<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.240> mother<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.780> boo<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.950> those

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
bonnie is the mother of boo and those

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.670 
bonnie is the mother of boo and those
toys<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.820> amy<00:04:36.390> passed<00:04:36.810> down<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.230> her<00:04:37.410> were

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
toys that amy passed down to her were

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.110 
toys that amy passed down to her were
then<00:04:37.830> passed<00:04:38.100> down<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.670> boo

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
then passed down to boo

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000 
then passed down to boo
meaning<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.390> Jessie<00:04:40.050> was<00:04:40.320> actually<00:04:40.740> owned

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
meaning that Jessie was actually owned

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.270 
meaning that Jessie was actually owned
by<00:04:41.130> Andy's<00:04:41.760> mother<00:04:41.970> Emily<00:04:42.810> Andy<00:04:43.620> himself
