know<00:02:14.640> what<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.909> bit<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.510> neatly

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
know what this bit is here neatly

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.720 
know what this bit is here neatly
wrapped<00:02:16.290> away<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.769> little<00:02:17.069> quilt<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.610> we'll

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
wrapped away this little quilt so we'll

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
wrapped away this little quilt so we'll
just<00:02:17.760> put<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.330> side<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
just put up to one side for now and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.380 
just put up to one side for now and
underneath<00:02:20.280> we've<00:02:20.610> got<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.879> our<00:02:20.909> bits<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
bobs here we have a little power cube

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.920 
bobs here we have a little power cube
here<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.849> as<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.150> see<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:27.599> where<00:02:27.810> we

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
here with as you can see that's where we

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.679 
here with as you can see that's where we
attach<00:02:28.560> our<00:02:28.799> single<00:02:29.189> free<00:02:29.400> pin<00:02:29.609> UK<00:02:29.909> plug<00:02:30.269> on<00:02:30.480> to

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
attach our single free pin UK plug on to

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.410 
attach our single free pin UK plug on to
so<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.109> we<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.319> use<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:33.359> mag<00:02:33.599> say

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
so that we can use the mag say

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.120 
so that we can use the mag say
and<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.660> also<00:02:35.780> extend<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.770> well<00:02:36.920> using

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
and we can also extend it as well using

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.010 
and we can also extend it as well using
that<00:02:37.340> power<00:02:37.700> extension<00:02:38.150> cord<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.900> we've

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
that power extension cord so that we've

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.600 
that power extension cord so that we've
got<00:02:39.050> an<00:02:39.260> even<00:02:39.470> longer<00:02:39.740> lead<00:02:40.100> if<00:02:40.310> we<00:02:40.400> want<00:02:40.550> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
got an even longer lead if we want to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.420 
got an even longer lead if we want to
use<00:02:40.670> our<00:02:40.940> macbook<00:02:41.390> across<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.080> room<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.010> put

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
use our macbook across the room and put

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.990 
use our macbook across the room and put
far<00:02:43.640> away<00:02:43.820> from<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.270> power<00:02:44.480> sources

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
far away from one of the power sources

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.540 
far away from one of the power sources
so<00:02:47.000> i'll<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.120> show<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:47.810> how<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.550> actual

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
so i'll just show you now how the actual

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.170 
so i'll just show you now how the actual
free<00:02:49.790> pin<00:02:50.590> power<00:02:51.590> plug<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.070> adapts<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.880> that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
free pin power plug it adapts to that

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.330 
free pin power plug it adapts to that
cube<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.930> as<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.710> we<00:02:54.860> had<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> separate

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
cube so as you can see we had a separate

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.070 
cube so as you can see we had a separate
one<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.850> box<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:56.840> just

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
one that was in the box and this just

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.010 
one that was in the box and this just
clips<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.560> nicely<00:02:58.120> really<00:02:59.120> nice<00:02:59.270> apple<00:02:59.690> design

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that just allows us to use our magsafe

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.740 
that just allows us to use our magsafe
power<00:03:04.310> adapter<00:03:05.060> we've<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.810> short<00:03:06.080> lead

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
power adapter we've just a short lead

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.090 
power adapter we've just a short lead
there's<00:03:08.750> magsafe<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.590> connected<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
there's magsafe so just connected to the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.600 
there's magsafe so just connected to the
side<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.490> macbook<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:13.280> what's<00:03:13.460> in

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
