five spot we have Tristan Aero now his
missile<00:00:17.130> was<00:00:17.250> probably<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> most

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
missile was probably one of the most

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
missile was probably one of the most
simplest<00:00:18.779> missiles<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:19.619> been

why<00:00:22.230> he<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.010> position<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:24.000> his

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
why he is in this position now his

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.970 
why he is in this position now his
missile<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.660> mostly<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.380> color<00:00:25.650> and

sticker<00:01:49.490> on<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.060> over<00:01:50.390> fender<00:01:50.720> there<00:01:50.899> and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
sticker on the over fender there and

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.499 
sticker on the over fender there and
everything<00:01:52.369> just<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.000> know<00:01:53.090> came<00:01:53.360> together

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
everything just you know came together

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.389 
everything just you know came together
for<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:53.959> car<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.319> I<00:01:54.380> thought<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.740> was<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.220> was

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
for this car and I thought it was it was

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.309 
for this car and I thought it was it was
really<00:01:55.759> different<00:01:56.270> than<00:01:56.659> most<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.200> other

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
really different than most of the other

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.199 
really different than most of the other
ones<00:01:57.500> also<00:01:58.220> as<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.459> can<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> rocker

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
ones also as you can see on the rocker

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.389 
ones also as you can see on the rocker
cover<00:01:59.539> there<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.080> has<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.380> sticker<00:02:00.890> bomb<00:02:01.130> which

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
cover there it has a sticker bomb which

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.059 
cover there it has a sticker bomb which
is<00:02:01.580> pretty<00:02:01.789> cool<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.600> hasn't<00:02:02.990> been<00:02:03.110> seen<00:02:03.350> with

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
is pretty cool it hasn't been seen with

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.830 
is pretty cool it hasn't been seen with
the<00:02:04.189> rest<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.520> cars<00:02:04.729> yet<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.209> we're<00:02:05.720> gonna

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
the rest of the cars yet and we're gonna

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.820 
the rest of the cars yet and we're gonna
move<00:02:06.049> on

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190 

so<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.850> first<00:02:13.030> place<00:02:13.330> spot<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:13.810> Jake

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so in the first place spot we have Jake

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520 
so in the first place spot we have Jake
cellars<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:15.040> another<00:02:15.460> s<00:02:15.840> 14.3<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.050> thought

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
cellars with another s 14.3 I thought

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.950 
cellars with another s 14.3 I thought
this<00:02:17.710> was<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> best<00:02:18.310> car<00:02:18.880> I've<00:02:19.150> received<00:02:19.660> yet

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
this was the best car I've received yet

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.480 
this was the best car I've received yet
even<00:02:20.350> though<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> colors<00:02:20.890> aren't<00:02:21.070> all<00:02:21.220> messed

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
even though the colors aren't all messed

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.390 
even though the colors aren't all messed
up<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:22.360> does<00:02:22.660> look<00:02:22.990> very<00:02:23.200> very<00:02:23.590> miss<00:02:23.980> Lee<00:02:24.220> I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
up it does look very very miss Lee I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.010 
up it does look very very miss Lee I
really<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.030> how<00:02:25.240> he<00:02:25.270> repositioned<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
really like how he repositioned the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.110 
really like how he repositioned the
front<00:02:26.260> headlights<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.250> front<00:02:27.520> bash<00:02:27.790> bar

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
front headlights and the front bash bar

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.940 
front headlights and the front bash bar
and<00:02:28.420> splitter<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.650> felt<00:02:29.890> that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and splitter I just really felt that

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.440 
and splitter I just really felt that
there<00:02:30.130> was<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> lot<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.460> creativity<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:31.270> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
there was a lot of creativity with this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.760 
there was a lot of creativity with this
one<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.050> why<00:02:32.230> he<00:02:32.380> gets<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.650> number

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
one and that's why he gets the number
