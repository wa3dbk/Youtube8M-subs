00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
than maybe I should have it's been weird
and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.129> question<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> should

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.910 
and the question of how much you should
charge<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:08.600> basically<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.320> difference

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
charge is is basically it's a difference

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
charge is is basically it's a difference
it<00:01:11.240> varies<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.720> different<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.320> each

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it varies and it's different for each

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
it varies and it's different for each
individual<00:01:14.280> each<00:01:14.520> designer<00:01:15.060> everyone's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
individual each designer everyone's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.280 
individual each designer everyone's
different<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.939> your<00:01:17.939> target<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:19.080> your

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
different because your target more your

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
different because your target more your
target<00:01:19.590> audience<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> different<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.939> an

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
target audience is different so an

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.590 
target audience is different so an
example<00:01:21.720> would<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:23.119> target<00:01:24.119> mom-and-pop

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
