this is a there's three new gameplay
modes<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.470> game<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.520> first<00:02:33.790> will<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.270> go

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
modes in the game the first will just go

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.880 
modes in the game the first will just go
over<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.630> one<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.080> big<00:02:35.319> cities<00:02:35.739> and

over this one this is big cities and
essentially<00:02:36.220> you're<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.730> have

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
essentially you're just going to have

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
essentially you're just going to have
all<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.989> there<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.739> just

makes<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.370> lot<00:02:39.489> tighter<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.239> game<00:02:40.420> because

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
makes it a lot tighter of a game because

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.570

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
understand I played them just to try

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.170 
understand I played them just to try
them<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.440> don't<00:05:13.860> understand<00:05:14.190> why<00:05:14.310> anyone<00:05:14.669> on

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
them I don't understand why anyone on

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.450 
them I don't understand why anyone on
the<00:05:15.479> regular<00:05:15.990> would<00:05:16.350> play<00:05:16.650> those<00:05:16.889> game<00:05:17.160> modes

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
the regular would play those game modes

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.490 
the regular would play those game modes
um<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.539> just<00:05:18.630> seems<00:05:18.960> like<00:05:19.080> you're<00:05:19.229> kind<00:05:19.289> of

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
um it just seems like you're kind of

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.409 
um it just seems like you're kind of
limiting<00:05:19.800> your<00:05:19.919> game<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.430> understand<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.240> big

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
limiting your game I understand the big

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.659 
limiting your game I understand the big
cities<00:05:21.780> kind<00:05:22.169> of<00:05:22.350> because<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.889> stresses

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
cities kind of because you know stresses

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.980 
cities kind of because you know stresses
you<00:05:23.789> know<00:05:23.910> it's<00:05:24.060> gonna<00:05:24.180> get<00:05:24.330> clustered<00:05:24.870> up

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
you know it's gonna get clustered up

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.960 
you know it's gonna get clustered up
here<00:05:25.289> there<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.220> be<00:05:26.310> honest<00:05:26.490> with<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.940> I

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
here there but to be honest with you I I

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.060 
here there but to be honest with you I I
really<00:05:27.960> don't<00:05:28.200> understand<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:29.010> don't

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
really don't understand and I don't

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.560 
really don't understand and I don't
think<00:05:29.460> too<00:05:29.610> many<00:05:29.729> people<00:05:29.850> play<00:05:30.240> with<00:05:30.419> those

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
think too many people play with those

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.930 
think too many people play with those
game<00:05:30.930> modes<00:05:31.229> also<00:05:31.620> another<00:05:32.430> con<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.789> might

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
game modes also another con you might

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.460 
game modes also another con you might
have<00:05:33.060> about<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.479> is<00:05:33.660> if<00:05:33.960> you<00:05:34.050> didn't<00:05:34.229> like<00:05:34.320> to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
have about it is if you didn't like to

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.469 
have about it is if you didn't like to
derive<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:35.280> probably<00:05:35.849> not<00:05:36.120> going<00:05:36.360> to

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
derive this is probably not going to

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.210 
derive this is probably not going to
change<00:05:36.599> your<00:05:36.960> mind<00:05:37.110> because<00:05:37.320> not<00:05:37.590> too<00:05:37.919> much

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
change your mind because not too much

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.430 
change your mind because not too much
