basically how I taught her this trick is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
basically how I taught her this trick is
the<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.560> thing<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.770> did<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.130> every<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the first thing I did was every time I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
the first thing I did was every time I
jumped<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> command<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.020> seems<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.530> be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
jumped a lot of a command it seems to be

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.219 
jumped a lot of a command it seems to be
easier<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.880> she<00:01:33.060> stands<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.840> her<00:01:33.990> hind

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
easier when she stands up on her hind

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
easier when she stands up on her hind
leg<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.250> easier<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
leg like this it's easier to be like

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
leg like this it's easier to be like
July<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> listen<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> me<00:01:37.200> she<00:01:37.380> seems<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> listen

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
July to listen to me she seems to listen

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
July to listen to me she seems to listen
better<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.810> why<00:01:40.079> even

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
better that way I don't know why even

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
better that way I don't know why even
when<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> taught<00:01:40.890> her<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> round<00:01:41.280> round<00:01:41.460> trick

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
when I taught her the round round trick

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
when I taught her the round round trick
goes<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.140> first<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.590> did

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
goes the same way the first thing I did

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
goes the same way the first thing I did
was<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.430> single<00:01:44.850> London<00:01:45.299> Bridge<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
was I would single London Bridge but I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
was I would single London Bridge but I
will<00:01:46.020> hold<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> treat<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:47.009> underneath

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
will hold the treat down underneath

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
will hold the treat down underneath
right<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.509> she<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> tree

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
right here and she would see the tree

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.060 
right here and she would see the tree
and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.060> she'll<00:01:51.240> follow<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.009> then<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and then she'll follow it and then I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.389 
and then she'll follow it and then I
just<00:01:53.250> give<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> her<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.979> they<00:01:55.979> progressed

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
just give it to her then they progressed

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
just give it to her then they progressed
to<00:01:56.579> her<00:01:56.759> running<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.479> side<00:01:57.719> Ollie<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to her running from one side Ollie to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
to her running from one side Ollie to
the<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.439> side<00:01:58.799> before<00:01:59.040> she<00:01:59.399> gets<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.909> tree

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the other side before she gets the tree

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569
