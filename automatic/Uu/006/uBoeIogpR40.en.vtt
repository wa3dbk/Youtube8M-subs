and auto orient features in After

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.570 
and auto orient features in After
Effects<00:00:13.990> so<00:00:14.650> to<00:00:14.709> get<00:00:14.950> serving<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.369> go<00:00:15.430> down<00:00:15.520> to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
Effects so to get serving and go down to

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.029 
Effects so to get serving and go down to
After<00:00:16.030> Effects<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:17.650> going<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:17.920> be

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
After Effects and we're going to be

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.460 
After Effects and we're going to be
going<00:00:18.190> to<00:00:18.640> our<00:00:19.060> composition<00:00:19.990> window<00:00:20.110> and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
going to our composition window and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.160 
going to our composition window and
clicking<00:00:20.860> on<00:00:21.010> layer<00:00:21.250> new<00:00:21.880> salad<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:22.929> we're

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
clicking on layer new salad and we're

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.019 
clicking on layer new salad and we're
just<00:00:23.230> going<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.500> make<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:23.740> new<00:00:24.009> salad<00:00:24.429> any<00:00:24.640> color

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
just going to make a new salad any color

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.839 
just going to make a new salad any color
comp<00:00:25.570> size<00:00:25.810> click<00:00:26.650> OK<00:00:27.009> and<00:00:27.250> basically<00:00:27.699> we're

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
comp size click OK and basically we're

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.429 
comp size click OK and basically we're
basically<00:00:28.539> we're<00:00:28.810> going<00:00:28.929> to<00:00:28.990> be<00:00:29.080> using<00:00:29.259> this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
basically we're going to be using this

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.839 
basically we're going to be using this
as<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.769> shape<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:30.220> I'm<00:00:30.310> just<00:00:30.400> going<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.580> make<00:00:30.730> it

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
as a shape so I'm just going to make it

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.420 
as a shape so I'm just going to make it
into<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.089> kind<00:00:31.599> of<00:00:31.830> vertical<00:00:32.830> rectangle<00:00:33.370> and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
into a kind of vertical rectangle and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.300 
into a kind of vertical rectangle and
just<00:00:33.580> put<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.790> down<00:00:33.820> into<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.330> bottom<00:00:34.420> corner

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
just put it down into the bottom corner

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.100 
just put it down into the bottom corner
so<00:00:36.310> what<00:00:36.520> motion<00:00:36.880> sketch<00:00:37.120> which<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.930> first

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
so what motion sketch which is the first

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.210 
so what motion sketch which is the first
thing<00:00:38.230> we'll<00:00:38.350> be<00:00:38.470> talking<00:00:38.650> about<00:00:38.860> what<00:00:39.070> that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
thing we'll be talking about what that

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.010 
thing we'll be talking about what that
does<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.490> it<00:00:39.730> basically<00:00:39.940> allows<00:00:40.330> you<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.840> take

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
does is it basically allows you to take

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.320 
does is it basically allows you to take
and<00:00:41.320> draw<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:42.070> path<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.610> After<00:00:42.940> Effects<00:00:43.180> and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
and draw a path in After Effects and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.260 
and draw a path in After Effects and
animate<00:00:43.930> your<00:00:44.050> shape<00:00:44.350> along<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.950> so<00:00:45.490> in

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
animate your shape along it so in

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.000 
animate your shape along it so in
traditional<00:00:47.020> animation<00:00:47.290> with<00:00:47.650> in<00:00:47.740> After

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
traditional animation with in After

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.170 
traditional animation with in After
Effects<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.310> would<00:00:48.430> actually<00:00:48.550> have<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.880> set

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
Effects you would actually have to set

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.660 
Effects you would actually have to set
keyframes<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.900> rotation<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.800> position<00:00:51.490> and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
keyframes and rotation and position and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.760 
keyframes and rotation and position and
things<00:00:51.820> like<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.140> automatically<00:00:53.140> like

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
things like that automatically like

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.560 
things like that automatically like
you'd<00:00:54.280> basically<00:00:54.460> set<00:00:54.940> those<00:00:55.120> where<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.420> want

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
you'd basically set those where you want

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.540 
you'd basically set those where you want
it<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.690> move<00:00:55.960> but<00:00:56.830> this<00:00:56.920> will<00:00:57.100> automatically

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
it to move but this will automatically

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.220 
it to move but this will automatically
generate<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:58.210> for<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.600> as<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.990> kind<00:00:59.170> of

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
generate this for you as you kind of

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.870 
generate this for you as you kind of
move<00:00:59.380> your<00:00:59.530> mouse<00:00:59.680> around<00:00:59.710> in<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.640> path<00:01:00.850> that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
move your mouse around in the path that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.780 
move your mouse around in the path that
you<00:01:01.120> want<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.450> follow<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:03.370> order<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.640> get

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
you want it to follow so in order to get

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.369 
you want it to follow so in order to get
to<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.150> motion<00:01:04.360> sketch<00:01:04.720> window<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.049> go<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.259> to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
to the motion sketch window you go up to

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.960 
to the motion sketch window you go up to
window<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.890> then<00:01:05.979> down<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.310> motion<00:01:06.700> sketch

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
window and then down to motion sketch

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.149 
window and then down to motion sketch
and<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.360> already<00:01:07.450> have<00:01:07.659> mine<00:01:07.869> open<00:01:08.259> down<00:01:08.890> here

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
and I already have mine open down here

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.980 
and I already have mine open down here
so<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.610> is<00:01:09.760> what<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.060> panel<00:01:10.480> will<00:01:10.570> look<00:01:10.780> like

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
so this is what the panel will look like

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.320 
so this is what the panel will look like
you<00:01:11.140> have<00:01:11.260> capture<00:01:11.650> speed<00:01:12.180> smoothing<00:01:13.180> you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
you have capture speed smoothing you

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
you have capture speed smoothing you
have<00:01:13.510> show<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:14.320> have<00:01:14.500> start<00:01:14.980> duration

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
have show and you have start duration

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.310 
have show and you have start duration
and<00:01:15.610> start<00:01:16.060> capture<00:01:16.510> so<00:01:16.930> I'm<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:17.110> going<00:01:17.260> to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
and start capture so I'm just going to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.600 
and start capture so I'm just going to
set<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.590> back<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.950> 1<00:01:18.190> because<00:01:18.340> that's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
set this back to 1 because that's

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.890 
set this back to 1 because that's
probably<00:01:18.910> how<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.060> will<00:01:19.210> look<00:01:19.240> for<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
probably how it will look for you on the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.200 
probably how it will look for you on the
smoothing<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:21.730> going<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.909> show<00:01:22.150> you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
smoothing and I'm just going to show you

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.180 
smoothing and I'm just going to show you
straight<00:01:23.200> out<00:01:23.230> how<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.650> works<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.100> we're

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
straight out how this works so we're

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.590 
straight out how this works so we're
just<00:01:24.220> going<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.520> click<00:01:24.700> start<00:01:25.030> capture<00:01:25.420> and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
just going to click start capture and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.390 
just going to click start capture and
then<00:01:26.320> we're<00:01:26.590> just<00:01:26.620> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.040> make<00:01:27.250> sure<00:01:27.370> our

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
then we're just going to make sure our

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.950 
then we're just going to make sure our
cursors<00:01:27.909> at<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.120> beginning<00:01:28.450> there<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.840> then

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
cursors at the beginning there and then

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.890 
cursors at the beginning there and then
just<00:01:29.200> take<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.820> drag<00:01:30.820> along<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.120> path<00:01:31.330> wherever

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
just take and drag along a path wherever

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.410 
just take and drag along a path wherever
you<00:01:32.020> want<00:01:32.200> your<00:01:32.470> object<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> go<00:01:33.300> so<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.330> can

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
you want your object to go so you can

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.149 
you want your object to go so you can
see<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:34.750> made<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.930> bunch<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.440> keyframes<00:01:35.800> if<00:01:36.070> we

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
see it's made a bunch of keyframes if we

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.740 
see it's made a bunch of keyframes if we
take<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.520> toggle<00:01:36.850> down<00:01:36.940> our<00:01:37.150> little<00:01:37.360> arrow<00:01:37.540> on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
take and toggle down our little arrow on

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.110 
take and toggle down our little arrow on
our<00:01:37.840> blue<00:01:38.110> salad<00:01:38.470> there<00:01:38.620> an<00:01:39.000> toggle<00:01:40.000> down

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
our blue salad there an toggle down

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.580 
our blue salad there an toggle down
transform<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.840> can<00:01:40.960> see<00:01:41.140> all<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.500> different

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
transform you can see all the different

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.620 
transform you can see all the different
points<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.310> made<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.330> if<00:01:43.479> we<00:01:43.600> take

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
points that it made and so if we take

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.960 
points that it made and so if we take
and<00:01:44.080> move<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.380> along<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:45.460> click<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:45.880> you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
and move this along we click on it you

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.520 
and move this along we click on it you
can<00:01:46.090> see<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.450> following<00:01:46.780> all<00:01:46.930> those<00:01:47.110> points

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
can see it's following all those points

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.830 
can see it's following all those points
and<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:48.190> moves<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.700> same<00:01:49.000> path<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:49.540> we

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
and it moves in that same path that we

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.990 
and it moves in that same path that we
just<00:01:50.020> moved<00:01:50.200> our<00:01:50.320> mouse<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.340> can<00:01:51.460> be<00:01:51.580> very

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
just moved our mouse so this can be very

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.570 
just moved our mouse so this can be very
good<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.570> doing<00:01:52.900> quick<00:01:53.110> animation<00:01:53.380> or<00:01:54.190> if<00:01:54.490> you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
good for doing quick animation or if you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.800 
good for doing quick animation or if you
want<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.790> take<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> time<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.360> refine<00:01:55.630> these

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
want to take the time to refine these

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.969 
want to take the time to refine these
keyframes<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.380> can<00:01:56.500> take<00:01:56.620> any<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.920> these

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
keyframes you can take any of these

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.410 
keyframes you can take any of these
keyframes<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.520> pretty<00:01:57.760> much<00:01:57.820> just<00:01:58.030> move<00:01:58.270> them

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
keyframes and pretty much just move them

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870 
keyframes and pretty much just move them
around<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.770> can<00:01:59.920> actually<00:02:00.100> refine<00:02:00.670> them

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
around and you can actually refine them

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.440 
around and you can actually refine them
how<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.120> would<00:02:01.330> like<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.549> if<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.060> want<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.299> a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
how you would like so if you want it a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.070 
how you would like so if you want it a
little<00:02:04.750> bit<00:02:04.990> more<00:02:05.110> fine-tuned<00:02:06.869> animation<00:02:07.869> on

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
little bit more fine-tuned animation on

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.660 
little bit more fine-tuned animation on
there<00:02:08.319> what<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.709> can<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.250> I'm<00:02:09.459> just<00:02:09.519> going

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
there what you can do is I'm just going

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
there what you can do is I'm just going
to<00:02:09.909> take<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.980> delete<00:02:11.980> these<00:02:12.099> keyframes<00:02:12.340> out

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to take and delete these keyframes out

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.899 
to take and delete these keyframes out
and<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.280> start<00:02:14.580> over<00:02:14.909> here<00:02:16.580> put<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.640> down

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
and we can start over here put that down

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.670 
and we can start over here put that down
layer<00:02:18.150> move<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> beginning<00:02:19.140> now

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
layer move this to the beginning now

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
layer move this to the beginning now
what<00:02:20.159> these<00:02:20.340> other<00:02:20.549> settings<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.209> are

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
what these other settings do are

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.509 
what these other settings do are
basically<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.409> have<00:02:22.590> captured<00:02:22.920> speed<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.430> one

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
basically you have captured speed at one

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.309 
basically you have captured speed at one
hundred<00:02:23.580> percent<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.360> we're<00:02:24.540> capturing<00:02:24.780> at

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
hundred percent so we're capturing at

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.470 
hundred percent so we're capturing at
real<00:02:25.799> time<00:02:26.040> basically<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
real time basically so if you have a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
real time basically so if you have a
really<00:02:27.780> precise<00:02:28.260> say<00:02:29.250> you're<00:02:29.400> doing<00:02:29.610> like

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
really precise say you're doing like

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.699 
really precise say you're doing like
some<00:02:29.970> kind<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.150> spiral<00:02:30.720> effect<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.379> your<00:02:31.440> shape

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
some kind of spiral effect to your shape

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.770 
some kind of spiral effect to your shape
you're<00:02:32.610> probably<00:02:32.849> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.120> want<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.659> take

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
you're probably going to want to take

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.030 
you're probably going to want to take
your<00:02:33.959> time<00:02:34.200> when<00:02:34.409> you're<00:02:34.500> moving<00:02:34.620> your<00:02:34.890> mouse

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
your time when you're moving your mouse

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.319 
your time when you're moving your mouse
around<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.579> you're<00:02:35.700> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.849> want<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.180> move

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
around so you're going to want to move

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.059 
around so you're going to want to move
slower<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.379> capturing<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.890> real

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
slower so you're not capturing it real

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
slower so you're not capturing it real
time<00:02:38.280> you'd<00:02:38.459> put<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.819> something<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.329> half

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
time you'd put it on something like half

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.180 
time you'd put it on something like half
time<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.519> I'm<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.849> you'd<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.150> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
time or a for that I'm so you'd up this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.099 
time or a for that I'm so you'd up this
number<00:02:44.190> depending<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.790> how<00:02:45.060> slow<00:02:45.540> you're

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
number depending on how slow you're

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.020 
number depending on how slow you're
actually<00:02:46.290> moving<00:02:46.560> your<00:02:46.799> mouse<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.849> can

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
actually moving your mouse or you can

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.940 
actually moving your mouse or you can
just<00:02:48.120> adjust<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.079> keyframes<00:02:49.500> later<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:49.920> this

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
just adjust the keyframes later but this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.589 
just adjust the keyframes later but this
kind<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.280> gives<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.700> chance<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.299> do<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
kind of gives you the chance to do that

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.229 
kind of gives you the chance to do that
right<00:02:51.660> away<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.799> with<00:02:52.859> in<00:02:53.099> smoothing<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:54.120> is

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
right away now with in smoothing this is

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.460 
right away now with in smoothing this is
definitely<00:02:54.359> something<00:02:54.599> i'd<00:02:54.900> recommend<00:02:55.290> using

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
definitely something i'd recommend using

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.599 
definitely something i'd recommend using
you<00:02:55.680> saw<00:02:55.890> how<00:02:56.099> there<00:02:56.250> were<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> ton<00:02:56.549> of

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
you saw how there were a ton of

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.759 
you saw how there were a ton of
different<00:02:56.790> key<00:02:57.120> frames<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.349> want<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.590> cut

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
different key frames if you want to cut

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.660 
different key frames if you want to cut
the<00:02:58.980> keyframes<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.879> having<00:03:00.200> like<00:03:01.670> more

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the keyframes down to having like more

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.089 
the keyframes down to having like more
distinct<00:03:03.450> keyframes<00:03:04.409> rather<00:03:04.650> than<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
distinct keyframes rather than just a

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.250 
distinct keyframes rather than just a
bunch<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.519> them<00:03:05.670> basically<00:03:06.599> having<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:07.019> one

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
bunch of them basically having at one

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.509 
bunch of them basically having at one
smoothing<00:03:07.680> will<00:03:07.769> give<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.250> most

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
smoothing will give you the most

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.750 
smoothing will give you the most
accurate<00:03:09.230> representation<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.549> how<00:03:11.549> your

accurate representation of how your

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.849 
accurate representation of how your
mouse<00:03:11.940> moved<00:03:12.269> but<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.290> take<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.650> put<00:03:13.769> it

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
mouse moved but if you take and put it

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.080 
mouse moved but if you take and put it
up<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.069> something<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.430> 10<00:03:14.700> which<00:03:14.909> i<00:03:15.030> would

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
up at something like 10 which i would

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.050 
up at something like 10 which i would
recommend<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:15.989> do<00:03:16.140> start<00:03:16.409> capture

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
recommend and then you do start capture

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.000 
recommend and then you do start capture
it<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.329> take<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.900> it'll<00:03:19.410> kind<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.739> make<00:03:19.829> some

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it will take and it'll kind of make some

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.330 
it will take and it'll kind of make some
key<00:03:20.370> key<00:03:21.000> frames<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.889> see<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.190> now

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
key key frames and you can see that now

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.569 
key key frames and you can see that now
we<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.700> instead<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.859> 30<00:03:25.859> keyframes<00:03:26.430> or

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
we have instead of like 30 keyframes or

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.250 
we have instead of like 30 keyframes or
something<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:26.910> have<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.269> whether<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.169> was

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
something we have like whether it was

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.110 
something we have like whether it was
probably<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.680> than<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.669> have<00:03:29.819> some

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
probably more than that we have some

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.240 
probably more than that we have some
distinct<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.319> few<00:03:31.590> key<00:03:31.769> frames<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
distinct just a few key frames and so

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.979 
distinct just a few key frames and so
it's<00:03:32.370> much<00:03:32.549> easier<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.940> tweak<00:03:33.299> your<00:03:33.510> animation

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
it's much easier to tweak your animation

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.710 
it's much easier to tweak your animation
later<00:03:34.169> on<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> that's<00:03:35.819> basically<00:03:36.030> how<00:03:36.299> motion

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
later on so that's basically how motion

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.940 
later on so that's basically how motion
sketch<00:03:36.900> works<00:03:37.139> it's<00:03:37.319> really<00:03:37.530> good<00:03:37.709> for

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
sketch works it's really good for

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400 
sketch works it's really good for
mocking<00:03:38.400> up<00:03:38.579> animation<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.419> you<00:03:40.290> can

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
mocking up animation and you can

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
mocking up animation and you can
actually<00:03:40.560> use<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:40.919> for<00:03:41.220> some<00:03:41.400> pretty<00:03:41.609> nice

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
actually use it for some pretty nice

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.330 
actually use it for some pretty nice
stuff<00:03:42.660> as<00:03:42.900> well<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.620> for<00:03:43.889> animating

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
stuff as well so just for animating

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.250 
stuff as well so just for animating
position<00:03:44.879> around<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.690> now<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.049> have<00:03:46.079> our

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
position around so now that we have our

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.259 
position around so now that we have our
paths<00:03:46.739> going<00:03:47.310> right<00:03:47.489> now<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.790> kind<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.060> looks

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
paths going right now it kind of looks

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.479 
paths going right now it kind of looks
like<00:03:48.359> we've<00:03:48.750> made<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> windy<00:03:49.620> road<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
like we've made a windy road so the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.500 
like we've made a windy road so the
second<00:03:50.760> thing<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:50.940> want<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.180> showing<00:03:51.359> you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
second thing I want to be showing you

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.659 
second thing I want to be showing you
how<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.629> do<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.019> auto<00:03:52.290> orient<00:03:52.799> your<00:03:52.919> shape<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
how to do is auto orient your shape and

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.250 
how to do is auto orient your shape and
what<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.819> mean<00:03:53.879> by<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.359> say<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.079> we

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
what I mean by this is say that we

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
what I mean by this is say that we
imagine<00:03:55.829> our<00:03:55.980> blue<00:03:56.220> shape<00:03:56.459> as<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.730> car<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.510> we

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
imagine our blue shape as a car and we

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.689 
imagine our blue shape as a car and we
want<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.199> be<00:03:58.410> going<00:03:58.949> along<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.310> windy

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
want it to be going along this windy

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.599 
want it to be going along this windy
road<00:04:00.319> from<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> top<00:04:01.799> down<00:04:02.069> like<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> bird's

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
road from like a top down like a bird's

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.819 
road from like a top down like a bird's
eye<00:04:02.760> view<00:04:02.790> perspective<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:04.109> when<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.560> gets<00:04:04.739> to

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
eye view perspective now when it gets to

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.460 
eye view perspective now when it gets to
this<00:04:04.919> curve<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.519> would<00:04:05.639> be<00:04:05.790> probably<00:04:06.470> rotated

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this curve it would be probably rotated

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.349 
this curve it would be probably rotated
and<00:04:07.620> be<00:04:07.769> going<00:04:08.040> around<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.400> rotate<00:04:08.910> as<00:04:09.120> its

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
and be going around and rotate as its

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.479 
and be going around and rotate as its
following<00:04:09.690> around<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.340> this

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
following around here now to do this

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.150 
following around here now to do this
without<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.599> after<00:04:13.560> effects<00:04:13.829> feature<00:04:14.040> i'm

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
without the after effects feature i'm

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.110 
without the after effects feature i'm
going<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.340> show<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.459> you'd<00:04:14.699> basically<00:04:14.849> have

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
going to show you you'd basically have

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.479 
going to show you you'd basically have
to<00:04:15.359> be<00:04:15.810> rotating<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.500> periodically<00:04:16.979> along

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
to be rotating it periodically along

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.279 
to be rotating it periodically along
here<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.729> setting<00:04:18.060> keyframes<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:19.169> would

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
here and setting keyframes and it would

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.229 
here and setting keyframes and it would
take<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> while<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.669> what<00:04:20.940> I'm<00:04:21.030> going<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> show

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
take a while so what I'm going to show

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.120 
take a while so what I'm going to show
you<00:04:21.419> here<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.780> if<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.229> just<00:04:22.260> I'm<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:22.890> going

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
you here is if you just I'm just going

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
you here is if you just I'm just going
to<00:04:23.190> close<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:23.840> simplicity<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:25.320> if<00:04:25.440> you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
to close that for simplicity is if you

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.860 
to close that for simplicity is if you
click<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.800> your<00:04:25.950> layer<00:04:26.130> then

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
click on your layer then

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.350 
click on your layer then
two-layer<00:04:27.229> now<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.830> transform<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:29.150> go<00:04:29.270> down

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
two-layer now to transform then go down

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.200 
two-layer now to transform then go down
to<00:04:29.419> auto<00:04:29.840> orient<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.560> then<00:04:31.220> click<00:04:31.729> orient

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
to auto orient and then click orient

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.460 
to auto orient and then click orient
along<00:04:32.449> a<00:04:32.479> path<00:04:32.750> which<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.199> what<00:04:33.350> we<00:04:33.440> have

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
along a path which is what we have

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.140 
along a path which is what we have
already<00:04:33.800> created<00:04:34.100> with<00:04:34.370> our<00:04:34.550> motion<00:04:34.910> sketch

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
already created with our motion sketch

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.600 
already created with our motion sketch
just<00:04:35.570> click<00:04:35.720> ok<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.260> basically<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.310> will<00:04:37.370> take

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
just click ok and basically it will take

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.350 
just click ok and basically it will take
and<00:04:37.850> move<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:38.900> shape<00:04:39.699> along<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.940> path<00:04:41.150> and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
and move your shape along the path and

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.060 
and move your shape along the path and
it'll<00:04:41.540> oriented<00:04:42.080> depending<00:04:42.500> on<00:04:42.620> how<00:04:42.889> your

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
it'll oriented depending on how your

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.310 
it'll oriented depending on how your
path<00:04:43.760> moves<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:44.660> now<00:04:44.780> if<00:04:44.840> we<00:04:44.930> want<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.139> to<00:04:45.199> look

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
path moves so now if we want it to look

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.379 
path moves so now if we want it to look
like<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.530> car<00:04:45.860> we'll<00:04:46.130> just<00:04:46.310> kind<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.580> fix<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.300> on

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
like a car we'll just kind of fix it on

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.629 
like a car we'll just kind of fix it on
the<00:04:47.540> very<00:04:47.690> beginning<00:04:47.900> position<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.430> it's

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
the very beginning position so that it's

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.100 
the very beginning position so that it's
kind<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.820> pointing<00:04:50.180> towards<00:04:50.540> where<00:04:50.930> it's

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
kind of pointing towards where it's

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.280 
kind of pointing towards where it's
going<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.290> be<00:04:51.380> driving<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.930> can<00:04:54.110> see

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
going to be driving and I you can see

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.740 
going to be driving and I you can see
that<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.560> auto<00:04:54.830> Orient's<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.000> path<00:04:56.210> so

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
that it auto Orient's to that path so

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.090 
that it auto Orient's to that path so
this<00:04:56.870> can<00:04:56.990> be<00:04:57.020> really<00:04:57.260> helpful<00:04:57.470> um<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.070> just

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
this can be really helpful um I just

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.020 
this can be really helpful um I just
thought<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.400> should<00:04:58.460> bring<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:58.790> up<00:04:58.910> because

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
thought I should bring that up because

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.670 
thought I should bring that up because
we<00:04:59.330> already<00:04:59.479> had<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.720> curving<00:05:00.199> path<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.620> we

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
we already had a curving path that we

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.650 
we already had a curving path that we
made<00:05:00.860> with<00:05:00.889> our<00:05:01.160> motion<00:05:01.490> sketch<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:02.539> it's

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
made with our motion sketch so it's

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.969 
made with our motion sketch so it's
definitely<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.050> nice<00:05:03.199> tip<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.680> don't<00:05:03.860> have

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
definitely a nice tip so you don't have

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.760 
definitely a nice tip so you don't have
to<00:05:04.510> manually<00:05:05.510> add<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.990> those<00:05:06.110> rotation

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
to manually add in those rotation

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.860 
to manually add in those rotation
keyframes<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:08.270> hope<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:08.479> guys<00:05:08.570> learned

keyframes so hope you guys learned

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.689 
keyframes so hope you guys learned
