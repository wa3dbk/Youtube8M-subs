trying to get out of the incident as

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
trying to get out of the incident as
well<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.320> Mariah's<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:25.890> by<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> looked

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
well as Mariah's go by and it looked

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
well as Mariah's go by and it looked
like<00:00:27.210> Heather's<00:00:28.039> spectacular<00:00:29.039> footage

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like Heather's spectacular footage

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.490 
like Heather's spectacular footage
that's<00:00:29.939> over<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.240> estas<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> brakes

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that's over I estas is on the brakes

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
that's over I estas is on the brakes
going<00:00:31.920> in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
going in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.300 
going in
and<00:00:34.080> I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.650> same<00:00:34.860> thing<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
and I think that's the same thing that

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.070 
and I think that's the same thing that
set<00:00:35.550> off<00:00:35.580> subject<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.330> you<00:00:36.450> pointed<00:00:36.930> outside

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
set off subject when you pointed outside

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.080 
set off subject when you pointed outside
to<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.190> hard<00:00:38.430> over<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> bridge<00:00:38.910> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to there he was hard over the bridge in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
to there he was hard over the bridge in
the<00:00:39.180> rear<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.750> came<00:00:39.930> around<00:00:40.050> watch<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the rear just came around watch that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
the rear just came around watch that
there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.130> with<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> large<00:00:41.700> nose<00:00:42.000> under

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
there is with the large nose under

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
there is with the large nose under
braking<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.440> he<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.580> little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
braking so he just has a little bit of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
braking so he just has a little bit of
rear<00:00:45.210> prize<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> come<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:46.860> car<00:00:47.070> up

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.430 

well<00:01:02.400> some<00:01:02.760> fun<00:01:02.940> audio<00:01:03.300> problems<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.110> will

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
well some fun audio problems here will

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.460 
well some fun audio problems here will
prevent<00:01:05.160> us<00:01:05.370> from<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.870> Jack<00:01:07.110> right

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
prevent us from going down to Jack right

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
prevent us from going down to Jack right
now<00:01:07.770> hopefully<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> correction

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
now hopefully we can get the correction

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.630 
now hopefully we can get the correction
solver<00:01:10.170> correction<00:01:10.800> up<00:01:11.730> to<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.150> chin

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640
