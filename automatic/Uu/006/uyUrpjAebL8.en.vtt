flat-screen TVs ok in terms of the range

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.120 
flat-screen TVs ok in terms of the range
that<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.719> handle<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.410> any<00:00:13.980> way

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
with obviously just hooking and holds

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.420 
with obviously just hooking and holds
like<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.070> okay<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.680> final<00:00:47.039> part<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like this okay and the final part of the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
like this okay and the final part of the
jigsaw<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> terms<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.680> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
jigsaw here in terms of the the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.670 
jigsaw here in terms of the the
bracketry<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:51.090> bar<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
bracketry is this bar here and this is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
bracketry is this bar here and this is
the<00:00:52.800> safety<00:00:53.039> bar<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.550> should<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.730> locks<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the safety bar but should be locks it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.119 
the safety bar but should be locks it
into<00:00:54.420> position<00:00:54.539> okay<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.920> move<00:00:56.070> back

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
into position okay so if I move back

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.410 
into position okay so if I move back
then<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> punch<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.000> come<00:01:00.210> down

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
then from that punch and we come down

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
then from that punch and we come down
here<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:03.019> let's<00:01:04.019> call<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.860> these

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
here and let's call it we have these

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
here and let's call it we have these
plugs<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> bolts<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
plugs and bolts here and we have the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
plugs and bolts here and we have the
washers<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> floating<00:01:09.150> balls<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.570> are

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
washers so the floating balls here are

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
washers so the floating balls here are
used<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.470> mounting<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.790> bracket<00:01:12.180> onto

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
used for mounting and the bracket onto

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
used for mounting and the bracket onto
the<00:01:12.780> wall<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.500> I'll<00:01:13.680> demonstrate<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the wall okay I'll demonstrate that in a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
the wall okay I'll demonstrate that in a
moment<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.689> washers<00:01:16.200> here

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
moment then we have these washers here

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
moment then we have these washers here
which<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.250> already<00:01:17.729> practical<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
which are not already practical but you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
which are not already practical but you
could<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:18.900> possibly<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> want<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
could use possibly if you want it and we

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.990 
could use possibly if you want it and we
have<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.479> come<00:01:21.630> along<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
have here we come along then and we have

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
have here we come along then and we have
these<00:01:24.140> offsets<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.040> actually

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
these offsets here so these are actually

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
these offsets here so these are actually
can<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.700> used<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.630> types<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> space

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
can be used with two types of space

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
can be used with two types of space
which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> small<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.250> longer<00:01:29.670> spacers<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
which is small and longer spacers and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
which is small and longer spacers and
the<00:01:30.630> idea<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.159> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the idea what this is that we can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
the idea what this is that we can
actually<00:01:32.700> push<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> whole<00:01:33.479> television<00:01:34.079> out

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
actually push the whole television out

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually push the whole television out
from<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> wall<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> little<00:01:34.890> before<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.299> can

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
from the wall a little before or we can

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
from the wall a little before or we can
make<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> decision<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> space

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
make a decision or we can use the space

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
make a decision or we can use the space
was<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.930> allow

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
was just on the top and actually allow

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
was just on the top and actually allow
us<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.320> truth<00:01:40.560> television<00:01:41.189> forward<00:01:41.579> okay

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
us the truth television forward okay

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.840 
us the truth television forward okay
this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> quite<00:01:43.439> clever<00:01:43.680> design<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> then

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this is quite clever design out and then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
this is quite clever design out and then
when<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.149> come<00:01:45.329> along<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:46.259> don't<00:01:46.290> know<00:01:46.799> we'll

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
when we come along we don't know we'll

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
when we come along we don't know we'll
say<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.520> buying<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.060> kit<00:01:48.329> whatever

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
say we're buying this kit whatever

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
say we're buying this kit whatever
they're<00:01:49.320> holes<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they're holes in the back of the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
they're holes in the back of the
television<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.270> four<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.630> five<00:01:51.899> six<00:01:52.500> or

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
television will be four or five six or

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
television will be four or five six or
eight<00:01:52.979> millimeter<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> provides<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.540> full

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
eight millimeter so it provides a full

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
eight millimeter so it provides a full
range<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.740> each<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> those<00:01:56.250> types<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
range and in each of those types it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
range and in each of those types it
comes<00:01:57.060> along<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.840> uses<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> provides<00:01:58.860> us

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
comes along and it uses it provides us

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.270 
comes along and it uses it provides us
with<00:01:59.040> both<00:01:59.369> short<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> lung<00:02:01.710> air

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
with both short and also the lung air

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.130 
with both short and also the lung air
both<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.090> depending<00:02:03.719> how<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> use<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
both so if depending how to use a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.249 
both so if depending how to use a
spacers<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:04.829> not<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.689> finally<00:02:07.079> have

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
spacers or not and and then finally have

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
spacers or not and and then finally have
it<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.560> start<00:02:07.799> locking<00:02:07.979> washers<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:08.640> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it to start locking washers here in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.680 
it to start locking washers here in

they're not here okay so I'm gonna do
here<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.270> look<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.930> television

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
here is we just look at this television

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.270 
here is we just look at this television
here<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> 32<00:02:14.730> inch<00:02:15.120> Toshiba<00:02:15.930> TV<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
here this is the 32 inch Toshiba TV and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.910 
here this is the 32 inch Toshiba TV and
what<00:02:17.430> we've<00:02:17.550> done<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> TV<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.920> we've

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
what we've done with this TV is we've

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.080 
what we've done with this TV is we've
taken<00:02:20.190> out<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.520> short<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.640> 6<00:02:23.640> millimeter

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
taken out the short and 6 millimeter

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
taken out the short and 6 millimeter
bolts<00:02:24.480> I've<00:02:25.020> actually<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.320> bolted<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
bolts I've actually just bolted the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
bolts I've actually just bolted the
bracket<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.400> we've<00:02:27.030> had<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> such<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> manner

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
bracket in we've had it in such a manner

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870 
bracket in we've had it in such a manner
in<00:02:28.380> which<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.770> hooks<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.280> pointing

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
in which the hooks are pointing

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.360 
in which the hooks are pointing
downwards<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.660> okay<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.220> this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
downwards like this okay so we have this

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.390 
downwards like this okay so we have this
anywhere<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.260> reason<00:02:34.470> adapter<00:02:35.250> M

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
anywhere so and now the reason adapter M

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.570 
anywhere so and now the reason adapter M
with<00:02:36.300> televisions<00:02:36.930> there's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> standard<00:02:38.040> visa

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
with televisions there's a standard visa

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.570 
with televisions there's a standard visa
the<00:02:38.880> SEM<00:02:39.560> specifications<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> specifies

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the SEM specifications so it specifies

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.750 
the SEM specifications so it specifies
how<00:02:41.820> far<00:02:42.090> apart<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> distances<00:02:43.320> between

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
how far apart and the distances between

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.030 
how far apart and the distances between
holes<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:45.900> basically<00:02:46.590> anyway<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.570> 75

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
holes so I'm basically anyway it's 75

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.480 
holes so I'm basically anyway it's 75
millimeters<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.260> 110<00:02:52.260> millimeters<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.010> 200

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
millimeters and 110 millimeters or 200

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.130 
millimeters and 110 millimeters or 200
millimeters<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.840> line<00:02:55.020> of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
millimeters but you can see this line of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
millimeters but you can see this line of
our<00:02:55.260> certainly<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:55.950> terms<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.370> series<00:02:56.730> of

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
our certainly here in terms of series of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.100 
our certainly here in terms of series of
holes<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.960> actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
holes here you know if that actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.660 
holes here you know if that actually
have<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> many<00:02:58.650> different<00:02:58.950> things<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.340> a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
have the many different things and a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.400 
have the many different things and a
slot<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.330> well<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:00.990> very<00:03:01.050> very

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
slot here as well so it's very very

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.050 
slot here as well so it's very very
versatile<00:03:01.860> even<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.580> wasn't<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> non

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
versatile even if it wasn't a non

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.790 
versatile even if it wasn't a non
standard<00:03:03.360> television<00:03:03.870> which<00:03:03.990> most<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
standard television which most out and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.990 
standard television which most out and
it<00:03:04.950> still<00:03:05.160> work<00:03:05.340> with<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.670> one

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it still work with this one

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.790 
it still work with this one
okay<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.110> put<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.500> for

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
okay so just going to put this down for

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.350 
okay so just going to put this down for
another<00:03:07.860> moment<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.850> then<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.300> to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
another moment and then it's going to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.340 
another moment and then it's going to
pop<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.780> bracket<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.260> wall

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
pop up with the bracket on the wall

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.280 
pop up with the bracket on the wall
mountain<00:03:11.250> already<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.210> tools<00:03:12.600> are<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.050> need

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
mountain already so tools are one need

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.729 
up to the wall we use the spirit level
like<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:27.120> check<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
like this we check that there the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.140 
like this we check that there the
bracket<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.220> entirely<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:31.400> square<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.700> flat

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
bracket is entirely a square and flat

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.360 
bracket is entirely a square and flat
and<00:03:33.480> what<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.290> down<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.620> marked<00:03:35.100> four

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
and what we do down is just marked four

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.790 
and what we do down is just marked four
holes<00:03:35.670> here<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:36.870> don't<00:03:37.230> know<00:03:37.350> one<00:03:37.530> man<00:03:37.680> but

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
holes here so we don't know one man but

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.350 
holes here so we don't know one man but
two<00:03:37.860> people<00:03:38.220> even<00:03:38.310> better<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.880> just<00:03:39.030> American

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
two people even better I'm just American

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.910 
two people even better I'm just American
here<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.110> see<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:40.500> if<00:03:40.590> we<00:03:40.650> wanted

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
here and you can see here if we wanted

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.140 
here and you can see here if we wanted
that<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.070> could<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.340> used<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> washers<00:03:42.000> here

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
that we could have used the washers here

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.600 
that we could have used the washers here
and<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.680> know<00:03:43.800> in<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.130> thing<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.430> didn't

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
and you know in this thing we didn't

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.610 
and you know in this thing we didn't
really<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.300> needed<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.140> we<00:03:46.440> just

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
really think that we needed so we just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.770 
really think that we needed so we just
would<00:03:46.980> mark<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.430> wall<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.970> four<00:03:48.150> holes<00:03:48.450> there

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
would mark the wall the four holes there

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.420 
would mark the wall the four holes there
and<00:03:49.080> then<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.350> come<00:03:49.530> along<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.980> then<00:03:50.130> we<00:03:50.220> just

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
and then we come along and then we just

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.410 
and then we come along and then we just
drill<00:03:50.610> those<00:03:50.790> four<00:03:51.060> holes

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
drill those four holes

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.870 
drill those four holes
pushing<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.260> plastic<00:03:52.830> cloves<00:03:53.130> which<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
pushing the for plastic cloves which is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.900 
pushing the for plastic cloves which is
a<00:03:53.910> show<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.330> here<00:03:54.630> again<00:03:55.280> for<00:03:56.280> plastic<00:03:56.700> hooks

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
a show you here again for plastic hooks

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.729 
a show you here again for plastic hooks
and<00:03:57.300> then<00:03:57.510> use<00:03:57.780> these<00:03:58.019> four<00:03:58.290> bullets<00:03:58.590> here

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
and then use these four bullets here

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
and then use these four bullets here
that's<00:03:59.489> H<00:03:59.760> what<00:03:59.940> we<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.269> we'll<00:04:00.390> actually

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that's H what we do is we'll actually

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.440 
that's H what we do is we'll actually
cover<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.230> would<00:04:01.680> use<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:04.340> stalker

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
cover down I would use this stalker

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.070 
cover down I would use this stalker
and<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:08.850> ratchet<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.240> we<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.600> type<00:04:10.750> them<00:04:10.960> into

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
and a ratchet and we just type them into

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.630 
and a ratchet and we just type them into
position<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.830> now<00:04:11.860> we<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.310> bracket

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
position so now we have the bracket

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.250 
position so now we have the bracket
mounted<00:04:12.970> on<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.120> wall<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:13.540> this<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.780> most<00:04:14.020> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
mounted on the wall so this is most of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.770 
mounted on the wall so this is most of
their<00:04:14.470> walk<00:04:14.860> them<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.820> next<00:04:16.299> step<00:04:16.480> is<00:04:16.660> to

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
their walk them so next step is to

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.050 
their walk them so next step is to
actually<00:04:16.900> come<00:04:17.200> along<00:04:17.440> for<00:04:18.310> safe<00:04:18.489> use<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.880> put

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
actually come along for safe use you put

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.509 
actually come along for safe use you put
this<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.359> here<00:04:19.560> well<00:04:20.560> do<00:04:20.739> at<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.040> point<00:04:21.250> is

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
this in here well do at this point is

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.890 
this in here well do at this point is
we'll<00:04:21.730> come<00:04:21.760> on<00:04:22.090> we'll<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.390> lift<00:04:22.540> up<00:04:22.690> this

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
we'll come on we'll just lift up this

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.920 
we'll come on we'll just lift up this
television<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:25.390> is<00:04:25.450> probably<00:04:25.810> the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
television this is probably the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.510 
television this is probably the
trickiest<00:04:26.110> parent<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.770> entire<00:04:27.040> assembly

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
trickiest parent of the entire assembly

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.610 
trickiest parent of the entire assembly
operation<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.780> try<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.960> position<00:04:32.380> my

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
operation so I just try to position my

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.520 
operation so I just try to position my
head<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.040> side<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.780> what<00:04:38.020> we<00:04:38.140> have<00:04:38.290> here

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
head to the side and what we have here

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.710 
head to the side and what we have here
is<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.890> have<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.040> blocking<00:04:39.430> position<00:04:39.580> okay<00:04:40.300> so

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
is we have a blocking position okay so

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.150 
is we have a blocking position okay so
we<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:40.930> slide<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.320> television<00:04:41.770> up<00:04:41.890> and<00:04:42.070> down

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
we can slide the television up and down

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.490 
we can slide the television up and down
along<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.640> rails<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.270> okay<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:46.350> we<00:04:47.350> can

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
along the rails like that okay so we can

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.900 
along the rails like that okay so we can
see<00:04:47.650> here<00:04:47.830> there's<00:04:48.010> only<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.250> far<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.490> can<00:04:48.700> go<00:04:48.850> on

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
see here there's only so far I can go on

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.420 
see here there's only so far I can go on
to<00:04:49.090> think<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:50.860> obviously<00:04:51.010> don't<00:04:51.220> to

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
to think and but we obviously don't to

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.100 
to think and but we obviously don't to
leave<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.669> like<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.850> because<00:04:52.150> there<00:04:52.510> carries

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
leave it like that because there carries

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.500 
leave it like that because there carries
so<00:04:53.770> what<00:04:53.919> we<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.850> we<00:04:55.060> have<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.240> bulb

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
so what we have here is we have a bulb

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.110 
so what we have here is we have a bulb
here<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.930> Florida<00:04:56.350> have<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.310> long<00:04:57.520> bar<00:04:57.760> here

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
here in Florida have this long bar here

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.000 
here in Florida have this long bar here
and<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.270> slide<00:04:58.480> it<00:04:58.690> true<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.500> we<00:04:59.650> actually

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
and we slide it true and we actually

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.610 
and we slide it true and we actually
look<00:05:00.220> Lucy<00:05:00.900> there<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:03.900> hole<00:05:04.900> on<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.230> back<00:05:05.440> of

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
look Lucy there is a hole on the back of

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.560 
look Lucy there is a hole on the back of
the<00:05:05.680> television<00:05:06.100> there<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.330> slight

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
the television there so this is a slight

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.290 
the television there so this is a slight
room<00:05:07.810> at<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> end<00:05:08.410> of<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:09.040> tube<00:05:09.610> here<00:05:09.880> has

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
room at the end of this tube here has

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.030 
room at the end of this tube here has
been<00:05:10.510> flattened<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.080> widened<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:11.979> it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
been flattened and widened so it

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.680 
been flattened and widened so it
actually<00:05:12.340> can't<00:05:12.550> push<00:05:12.880> through<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.330> hole<00:05:13.479> it

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
actually can't push through the hole it

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.360 
actually can't push through the hole it
can't<00:05:13.840> go<00:05:13.930> any<00:05:14.050> further<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:14.800> I've<00:05:14.919> come<00:05:15.220> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
can't go any further and I've come to

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
hole in the buyer here so we could just

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.960 
hole in the buyer here so we could just

would stop the bar moving forward okay
and<00:05:25.750> now<00:05:25.960> what<00:05:26.229> happens<00:05:26.380> is<00:05:26.680> if<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:26.919> should

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
it'll be fine but I mean it's a little

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.710 
it'll be fine but I mean it's a little
bit<00:05:54.640> limiting<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.150> terms<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.510> your<00:05:55.840> ability<00:05:55.960> to

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
bit limiting in terms of your ability to
