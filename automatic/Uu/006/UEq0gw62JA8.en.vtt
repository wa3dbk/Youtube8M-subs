00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
i'm at 24 ATK XP so I'm a little bit

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750 
i'm at 24 ATK XP so I'm a little bit
past<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.989> level<00:00:54.989> um<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.430> missed

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
past the level um and I actually missed

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
past the level um and I actually missed
the<00:00:56.879> screenshot<00:00:57.329> unfortunately<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> tend<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the screenshot unfortunately I tend to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
the screenshot unfortunately I tend to
just<00:00:59.100> zone<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.210> crafting<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
just zone out over in crafting and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.880 
just zone out over in crafting and
usually<00:01:00.809> watch<00:01:00.930> shows<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.410> whatever<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
usually watch shows or whatever and it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
usually watch shows or whatever and it
just<00:01:02.070> makes<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> same<00:01:03.120> thing<00:01:03.300> over<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> over

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
just makes the same thing over and over

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
just makes the same thing over and over
again<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> forget<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.760> don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
again so I kind of forget and I don't

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.450 
again so I kind of forget and I don't
always<00:01:06.060> pay<00:01:06.210> attention<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.750> XP<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
always pay attention to my XP and so I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.800 
always pay attention to my XP and so I
didn't<00:01:08.820> realize<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> and

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.600 
should have brought energy potion
because<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.460> terrible<00:04:53.400> alright<00:04:54.400> so

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
because this is terrible alright so

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.760 
because this is terrible alright so
nothing<00:04:54.910> special<00:04:55.210> from<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.660> one<00:04:55.840> God<00:04:56.560> sword

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
nothing special from that one God sword

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.240 
nothing special from that one God sword
is<00:04:56.950> actually<00:04:57.610> really<00:04:57.880> good<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.830> far<00:05:00.010> i<00:05:00.070> hit<00:05:00.220> a

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
is actually really good so far i hit a

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.580 
is actually really good so far i hit a
43<00:05:00.820> with<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.450> think<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:01.750> can<00:05:01.900> hit<00:05:01.990> over<00:05:02.260> 50

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
43 with it and I think I can hit over 50

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.830 
43 with it and I think I can hit over 50
on<00:05:02.770> likes<00:05:03.040> their<00:05:03.220> tests<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.700> stuff<00:05:03.910> and

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
on likes their tests and stuff and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.140 
on likes their tests and stuff and
probably<00:05:05.080> even<00:05:05.350> non<00:05:05.950> slayer<00:05:06.280> task<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.880> have<00:05:07.120> a

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
probably even non slayer task I have a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.440 
probably even non slayer task I have a
plus<00:05:07.620> 177<00:05:08.620> strength<00:05:09.100> bonus<00:05:09.460> right<00:05:09.580> now<00:05:09.790> which

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
plus 177 strength bonus right now which

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.730 
plus 177 strength bonus right now which
is<00:05:10.480> maximum<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.440> think<00:05:11.730> so<00:05:12.730> it's<00:05:12.940> pretty<00:05:13.210> insane

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
is maximum I think so it's pretty insane

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.950 
is maximum I think so it's pretty insane
I<00:05:14.740> mean<00:05:15.280> it's<00:05:15.430> not<00:05:15.490> as<00:05:15.730> good<00:05:15.880> as<00:05:16.030> whip<00:05:16.180> for<00:05:16.420> dps

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
I mean it's not as good as whip for dps

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960 
I mean it's not as good as whip for dps
against<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:17.380> low<00:05:17.500> defense<00:05:17.830> monsters<00:05:18.280> but<00:05:18.610> for

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
against the low defense monsters but for

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.370 
against the low defense monsters but for
the<00:05:19.360> bearers<00:05:19.660> whether<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.080> really<00:05:20.260> good

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
the bearers whether it's really good

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.510 
the bearers whether it's really good
because<00:05:20.530> they<00:05:20.740> have<00:05:20.830> high<00:05:20.950> may<00:05:21.130> lead<00:05:21.280> offense

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
because they have high may lead offense

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.800 
because they have high may lead offense
but<00:05:21.790> this<00:05:21.910> pretty<00:05:22.150> much<00:05:22.270> hits<00:05:22.450> right<00:05:22.600> through

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
but this pretty much hits right through

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.730 
but this pretty much hits right through
it<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.640> think<00:05:24.760> I<00:05:25.060> might<00:05:25.240> all<00:05:25.810> that<00:05:26.080> after<00:05:26.710> a

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
it so I think I might all that after a

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.990 
it so I think I might all that after a
run<00:05:26.950> or<00:05:27.070> two<00:05:27.100> i<00:05:27.220> think<00:05:27.520> i'm<00:05:27.610> just<00:05:27.640> going<00:05:27.940> to

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
run or two i think i'm just going to

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.210 
run or two i think i'm just going to
bank<00:05:28.360> for<00:05:28.810> an<00:05:29.290> energy<00:05:29.650> potion<00:05:29.800> because<00:05:30.130> this

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
bank for an energy potion because this

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.100 
bank for an energy potion because this
is<00:05:30.340> really<00:05:30.490> bad<00:05:30.700> i<00:05:30.970> usually<00:05:31.600> actually<00:05:31.870> do

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
is really bad i usually actually do

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.450 
is really bad i usually actually do
bring<00:05:32.320> them<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:32.650> i<00:05:32.680> just<00:05:32.860> forgot<00:05:33.010> this<00:05:33.220> time

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
bring them but i just forgot this time

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.370 
bring them but i just forgot this time
and<00:05:33.730> of<00:05:33.880> course<00:05:34.090> this<00:05:34.240> tunnel<00:05:34.570> is<00:05:34.690> all<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.260> way

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
and of course this tunnel is all the way

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.220 
and of course this tunnel is all the way
around<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.700> opposite<00:05:37.060> side<00:05:40.050> alright<00:05:41.050> here

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
around to the opposite side alright here

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.510 
around to the opposite side alright here
goes<00:05:41.260> chest<00:05:41.650> number<00:05:41.860> two<00:05:42.040> let's<00:05:42.220> see<00:05:42.370> what<00:05:42.460> I

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
goes chest number two let's see what I

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.660 
goes chest number two let's see what I
get<00:05:44.040> but<00:05:45.040> where<00:05:45.190> X<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:47.500> s<00:05:47.890> jess<00:05:48.130> is<00:05:48.340> working

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
get but where X so s jess is working

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.770 
get but where X so s jess is working
quite<00:05:48.820> well<00:05:48.940> here<00:05:49.530> I<00:05:50.530> think<00:05:51.460> thick<00:05:51.970> oh<00:05:52.660> if

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
quite well here I think thick oh if

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.230 
quite well here I think thick oh if
roach<00:05:52.990> on<00:05:53.230> land<00:05:53.590> right<00:05:53.710> there<00:05:53.920> I<00:05:54.100> think<00:05:55.060> in<00:05:55.150> the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
roach on land right there I think in the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.550 
roach on land right there I think in the
future<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.570> probably<00:05:55.900> will<00:05:56.110> bring<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.350> whip<00:05:56.530> to

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
future I probably will bring a whip to

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.820 
future I probably will bring a whip to
for<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.210> tunnels<00:05:58.210> just<00:05:58.390> because<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.650> have<00:05:59.740> to

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
for the tunnels just because you have to

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
for the tunnels just because you have to
get<00:05:59.950> Casey<00:06:00.190> obviously<00:06:00.790> and<00:06:02.400> whip<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.550> better

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
get Casey obviously and whip is better

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.600 
get Casey obviously and whip is better
for<00:06:04.060> dps<00:06:04.420> but<00:06:05.350> it<00:06:05.470> hits<00:06:05.650> really<00:06:06.010> well<00:06:06.250> against

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
for dps but it hits really well against

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.660 
for dps but it hits really well against
the<00:06:06.670> bosses<00:06:07.120> and<00:06:07.360> I'm<00:06:07.510> sure<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.720> like<00:06:08.560> 99<00:06:09.490> my

pretty happy about that and it is a
beast<00:06:34.390> I<00:06:34.750> haven't<00:06:35.380> tried<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.710> spec<00:06:35.920> out<00:06:36.070> at

beast I haven't tried the spec out at
all<00:06:36.370> yet<00:06:36.550> but<00:06:36.700> it's<00:06:36.820> really<00:06:37.060> better<00:06:37.450> for<00:06:37.750> like

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
all yet but it's really better for like

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.839 
all yet but it's really better for like
Slayer<00:06:38.170> and<00:06:38.320> stuff<00:06:38.530> because<00:06:38.680> it<00:06:38.920> kills<00:06:39.070> you

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
Slayer and stuff because it kills you

strength<00:06:52.959> I'm<00:06:53.139> not<00:06:53.259> actually<00:06:53.409> sure<00:06:53.589> if<00:06:53.800> the

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:54.279 
strength I'm not actually sure if the

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.070 
strength I'm not actually sure if the
barrel<00:06:55.179> chest<00:06:55.419> anchor<00:06:55.719> has<00:06:55.869> a<00:06:55.899> higher

barrel chest anchor has a higher
strength<00:06:56.349> bonus<00:06:56.679> but<00:06:57.610> I<00:06:57.639> think<00:06:57.909> God<00:06:58.059> swords

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
strength bonus but I think God swords

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.839 
strength bonus but I think God swords
might<00:06:58.539> have<00:06:58.659> the<00:06:58.749> highest<00:06:58.899> strength<00:06:59.229> bonus<00:06:59.849> in
