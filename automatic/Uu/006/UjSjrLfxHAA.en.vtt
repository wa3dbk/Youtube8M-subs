00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
lastly teams were previously playing

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499 
lastly teams were previously playing
each<00:01:49.740> other<00:01:49.890> four<00:01:50.310> times<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> split<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
each other four times in the split so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.179 
each other four times in the split so
when<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.049> towards<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
when you got to that towards the end you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
when you got to that towards the end you
you've<00:01:53.430> seen<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.000> three<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.689> three<00:01:54.930> times

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you've seen this three to three times

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
you've seen this three to three times
and<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:55.950> exciting<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and it's not as exciting as it can be so

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
and it's not as exciting as it can be so
we<00:01:57.030> wanted<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> reduce<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> exposure<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
we wanted to reduce the exposure of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
we wanted to reduce the exposure of
those<00:01:58.950> matchups<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.520> teams<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.299> gonna<00:02:00.390> be

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
those matchups so teams are gonna be

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
those matchups so teams are gonna be
playing<00:02:00.630> each<00:02:00.810> other<00:02:00.899> twice<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.590> we're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
playing each other twice now and we're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.260 
playing each other twice now and we're
we're<00:02:02.280> thinking<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.549> gonna<00:02:02.640> make<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we're thinking it's gonna make for a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
we're thinking it's gonna make for a
little<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.899> mystery<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.890> those

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
little bit more mystery around those

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
little bit more mystery around those

we<00:04:13.450> didn't<00:04:13.720> want<00:04:13.870> them<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.170> sort<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:15.400> here's

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
we didn't want them to sort of be here's

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.840 
we didn't want them to sort of be here's
the<00:04:15.700> rule<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.979> we<00:04:18.070> wanted<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.340> make<00:04:18.789> sure

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
the rule right so we wanted to make sure

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.240 
the rule right so we wanted to make sure
that<00:04:19.090> there<00:04:19.269> had<00:04:19.720> local<00:04:20.169> options<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:21.190> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
that there had local options and the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.350 
that there had local options and the
last<00:04:21.430> thing<00:04:21.609> or<00:04:21.700> non-residents<00:04:22.300> or

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
last thing or non-residents or

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.670 
last thing or non-residents or
international<00:04:22.840> players<00:04:23.020> that<00:04:23.169> come<00:04:23.320> over<00:04:23.409> and

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
international players that come over and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.010 
international players that come over and
they<00:04:23.950> haven't<00:04:24.250> been<00:04:24.340> here<00:04:24.520> for<00:04:24.550> 24<00:04:25.060> months<00:04:25.360> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
they haven't been here for 24 months and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.300 
they haven't been here for 24 months and
so<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.320> rule<00:04:26.470> as<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.620> states

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
so the rule as it states

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.280 
so the rule as it states
and<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.490> was<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> little<00:04:27.910> bit<00:04:28.150> wordy<00:04:28.900> here<00:04:29.080> but

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
and it was a little bit wordy here but

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.110 
and it was a little bit wordy here but
you<00:04:29.860> can<00:04:29.980> have<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> two<00:04:30.760> exempt

many exempt non-residents on your team

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.760 
many exempt non-residents on your team
as<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.150> want<00:04:34.419> but<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.200> have<00:04:35.320> two<00:04:35.590> or<00:04:35.740> more

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
you can't add any additional

you can't add any additional
non-resident<00:04:37.930> players<00:04:38.139> because<00:04:38.650> we<00:04:38.740> want

non-resident players because we want

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
that regional identity to remain intact

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.659 
that regional identity to remain intact
on<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.139> team<00:04:41.410> but<00:04:42.100> where<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.250> breaks<00:04:42.400> down<00:04:42.550> a

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
on the team but where it breaks down a

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.340 
on the team but where it breaks down a
little<00:04:42.820> bit<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.090> what<00:04:43.210> happens<00:04:43.419> yes<00:04:44.110> exactly

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
little bit is what happens yes exactly

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.990 
little bit is what happens yes exactly
which<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:44.980> what<00:04:45.130> happened<00:04:45.400> with<00:04:45.490> team<00:04:45.669> impulse

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
which is what happened with team impulse

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.060 
which is what happened with team impulse
exactly<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:46.630> if<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.990> one<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.590> not<00:04:47.800> two

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
exactly so if you have one and not two

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.320 
exactly so if you have one and not two
you<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.370> actually<00:04:48.639> still<00:04:48.850> add<00:04:49.000> two

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
you can actually still add two

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.850 
you can actually still add two
non-residents<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:50.050> your<00:04:50.169> team<00:04:50.320> which<00:04:50.710> is<00:04:50.830> what

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
non-residents on your team which is what

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.470 
non-residents on your team which is what
team<00:04:51.190> impulse<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.700> done<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.180> in<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.330> case<00:04:52.450> of

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
team impulse is done but in the case of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.720 
team impulse is done but in the case of
TSM<00:04:53.050> they<00:04:53.260> have<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.710> three<00:04:54.310> exempt

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
TSM they have a three exempt

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.890 
TSM they have a three exempt
non-residents<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:55.389> they're<00:04:55.510> not<00:04:55.660> allowed<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
non-residents so they're not allowed to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.650 
non-residents so they're not allowed to
add<00:04:56.080> any<00:04:56.730> alright<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:57.910> it's<00:04:58.180> all<00:04:58.360> well<00:04:58.540> and

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
in eSports kind of a broader question

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.920 
in eSports kind of a broader question
yeah<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.300> pretty<00:05:55.419> high<00:05:55.570> level<00:05:55.840> I

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
yeah that is it's pretty high level I

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.409 
yeah that is it's pretty high level I
think<00:05:56.160> discipline<00:05:57.160> is<00:05:57.280> really<00:05:57.490> important<00:05:57.940> at

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
think discipline is really important at

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.279 
think discipline is really important at
the<00:05:58.479> end<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.690> day<00:05:58.810> we<00:05:58.930> want<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.139> make<00:05:59.200> sure

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
the end of the day we want to make sure

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.890 
the end of the day we want to make sure
that<00:05:59.590> everyone's<00:06:00.130> playing<00:06:00.430> fair<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:01.780> give

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
that everyone's playing fair to give

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.230 
that everyone's playing fair to give
everyone<00:06:02.110> an<00:06:02.380> equal<00:06:02.710> chance<00:06:02.889> at<00:06:03.340> winning<00:06:03.460> and

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
everyone an equal chance at winning and

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.850 
everyone an equal chance at winning and
discipline<00:06:04.720> is<00:06:04.840> there<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.200> ensure<00:06:05.530> that<00:06:05.560> those

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
discipline is there to ensure that those

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.740 
discipline is there to ensure that those
things<00:06:06.070> are<00:06:06.310> happening<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.150> so<00:06:07.419> that's<00:06:07.600> why
