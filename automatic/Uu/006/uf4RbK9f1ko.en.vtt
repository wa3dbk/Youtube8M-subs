working<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.699> now

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:10.530 

I'm<00:01:01.180> going<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.420> get<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.570> bit<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:02.110> block<00:01:02.770> here<00:01:09.540> oat

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
I'm going to get a bit a block here oat

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.800 
I'm going to get a bit a block here oat
on<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.900> tire<00:01:11.500> just<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:11.950> stop<00:01:12.220> it<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:13.720> going

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
on that tire just to stop it we're going

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.070 
on that tire just to stop it we're going
to<00:01:13.930> do<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> same<00:01:14.350> thing<00:01:15.720> key<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> on

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
to do the same thing key to the on

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.960 
to do the same thing key to the on
position<00:01:17.110> you're<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.220> actually<00:01:18.400> trying<00:01:18.759> the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
position you're not actually trying the

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.240 
position you're not actually trying the
truck<00:01:19.210> turning<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.659> truck<00:01:19.840> on<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.159> in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
truck turning the truck on put it in

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.280 
truck turning the truck on put it in
reverse

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.570 

now<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.500> ain't<00:01:25.650> working<00:01:26.040> obviously<00:01:26.190> it's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
now if it ain't working obviously it's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.020 
now if it ain't working obviously it's
not<00:01:26.670> beeping<00:01:27.060> inside<00:01:28.370> so<00:01:29.370> you'll<00:01:29.550> come

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
not beeping inside so you'll come

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.110 
not beeping inside so you'll come
put<00:01:31.570> your<00:01:31.750> ear<00:01:32.050> right<00:01:32.980> next<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.400> each<00:01:33.580> sensor

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
put your ear right next to each sensor

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.930 
put your ear right next to each sensor
if<00:01:34.600> it's<00:01:35.530> working<00:01:35.890> your<00:01:36.070> hero<00:01:36.280> you're<00:01:36.700> hit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
if it's working your hero you're hit

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.760 
if it's working your hero you're hit
you'll<00:01:37.150> hear<00:01:37.480> a<00:01:37.510> ticking<00:01:38.020> sound<00:01:38.050> on<00:01:38.500> each

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
you'll hear a ticking sound on each

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.310 
you'll hear a ticking sound on each
sensor<00:01:39.280> for<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.180> one<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.540> ain't<00:01:40.630> ticking<00:01:41.170> is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
sensor for the one that ain't ticking is

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.740 
sensor for the one that ain't ticking is
the<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:41.890> that's<00:01:42.070> not<00:01:42.220> working<00:01:45.300> if<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.570> ain't

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
the one that's not working if it ain't

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.140 
the one that's not working if it ain't
working

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.830 

so<00:01:53.660> there's<00:01:53.900> your<00:01:54.050> sensor<00:01:54.500> pull<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.070> switch

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
so there's your sensor pull the switch

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.740 
so there's your sensor pull the switch
your<00:01:56.840> wiring<00:01:57.080> turn<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.040> 180<00:01:58.220> pop<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:58.910> out<00:01:59.000> this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
your wiring turn it 180 pop it out this

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.010 
your wiring turn it 180 pop it out this
is<00:01:59.900> on<00:01:59.990> my<00:02:00.140> expedition<00:02:00.650> of<00:02:00.740> course<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.870> can
