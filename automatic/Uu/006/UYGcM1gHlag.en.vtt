00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
about it make sure you back up all the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
about it make sure you back up all the
time<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> chance<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.340> could

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
time because there is a chance you could

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.280 
time because there is a chance you could
corrupt<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.509> game<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.990> you'd<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
corrupt the game and you'd have to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050 
corrupt the game and you'd have to
reinstall<00:02:01.860> our<00:02:01.920> repair

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
reinstall our repair

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
reinstall our repair
I<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.080> preparing<00:02:04.740> works<00:02:05.010> because

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
I don't think preparing works because

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.450 
I don't think preparing works because
it'll<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:06.120> that<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.380> game<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.250> game<00:02:08.429> will

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it'll think that the game the game will

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.100 
it'll think that the game the game will
think<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> files<00:02:09.240> are<00:02:09.509> correct

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
think the files are correct

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
think the files are correct
