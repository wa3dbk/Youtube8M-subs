00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.760
 roy's dream was always about pilots 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.019
 to become 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.730
 he studied hard and eventually became 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.500
 pilot with the air force 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.849
 until it he increasingly vague complaints 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.010
 got it and not even on his legs anymore 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.870
 could stand and progressive disease 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.670
 causes his heart magnification 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.310
 He is now on the waiting list for one 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.260
 new heart I can no longer go up in the air 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.280
 but roy is a go- ahead in one 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.960
 dream made way for another 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.760
 hi this now mathematical research and give 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.830
 full energy lesson at the defense academy 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.770
 in Breda 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 how you look can be remedied 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 not be corrected is in there 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.140
 last resort is a morning edge 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 fantasy 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 just a new heart and a you wait 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.309
 and then I hit my head and wait for 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 well i can't have two years in the beginning 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 they said guard doing this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 on average one and a half years or so 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 yes and apparently or active much longer 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 is 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.860
 yes it's just pretty heavy so it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 is how i feel like you every day 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.940
 OK the general energy gets up 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.199
 I still have to keep working and things 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.789
 keep doing I still have to wear a little 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 my career work well i have friends 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.750
 what things you want to do with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.070
 well that is just very tricky and sometimes 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.990
 something happens and then you come back into it 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 hospital then the pace is in the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 question of her in the hi though not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 How do you stand now alive 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 very positive or the right I pick you up 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 everything on 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.280
 when i got sick features before after may 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.080
 flown naturally and was beautiful 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 career I actually want for 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 go and make as had worked as i like 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 the quite a moment I lost it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 but I have my energy in something else 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.979
 I have completed two studies 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 picked up 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.330
 continued to work in defense defense 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 made it possible for me me 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.940
 got a PhD in tilburg on one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 subjects 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.649
 what defense is interested in yes 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.530
 in the end that is my one anyway 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.479
 little my dream is to be when i have one again 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.520
 heart and I get healthy again to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.649
 then do real things again 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.849
 so now i can't do one of those things 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.900
 exercise well then I want triathlons 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.970
 is going to do yes i wouter duinisveld 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.100
 of course my big example is the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.990
 just like the focal point asia had those holes 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.490
 he will do triathlons for next year 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.230
 whole triathlon 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.660
 he must be a super cool tab 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.660
 so that you like 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.810
 dead sick can also go back to 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.400
 live well get everything out I want it 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.320
 love to show people that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
 capable people who in 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.180
 hopeless situation down or anything but 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.860
 you can make something of it too 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.050
 naturally enough examples we 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.090
 yes bends degree bnn that this 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.980
 an example of which was very sick what 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.270
 he has not done and 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.730
 although it is difficult and sometimes sit 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.709
 a bit counter markets for us 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.270
 yes if I can why a contribution to 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.860
 help people to see that and 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.250
 let people positively than do 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.250
 going
