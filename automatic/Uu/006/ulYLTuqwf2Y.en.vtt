in<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.570> box<00:01:04.870> I<00:01:05.340> noticed<00:01:06.340> there<00:01:06.550> was<00:01:06.730> a<00:01:06.760> it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
in the box I noticed there was a it

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.080 
in the box I noticed there was a it
hadn't<00:01:07.810> been<00:01:07.930> set<00:01:08.229> up<00:01:08.260> yet

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
hadn't been set up yet

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.110 
hadn't been set up yet
it<00:01:10.479> needed<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.960> truss<00:01:11.229> rod<00:01:11.530> adjustment<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:13.000> of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120
