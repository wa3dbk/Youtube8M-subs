00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
that that works out good hopefully we'll

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.250 
that that works out good hopefully we'll
double<00:04:31.800> cross<00:04:32.040> our<00:04:32.250> fingers<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.570> ends

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
double cross our fingers that this ends
