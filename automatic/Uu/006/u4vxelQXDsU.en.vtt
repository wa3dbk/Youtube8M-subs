00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.039 

47<00:01:03.000> brand<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.769> seen<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:07.070> round<00:01:08.070> brims<00:01:09.049> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
47 brand all I've seen is round brims so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.920 
47 brand all I've seen is round brims so
it's<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> bad<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.720> don't

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's not a bad thing but if you don't

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.469 
it's not a bad thing but if you don't
like<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.189> prefer<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> square<00:01:15.150> brims

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
like that if you prefer the square brims

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
like that if you prefer the square brims
like<00:01:15.900> Mitchell<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.100> S<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.610> something<00:01:18.000> like

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
like Mitchell and S or something like

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:18.969 
like Mitchell and S or something like
that

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.480 
that
then<00:01:21.229> this<00:01:22.229> wouldn't<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> half<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
then this wouldn't be the half for you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.120 
then this wouldn't be the half for you
but<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.380> care<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
but me I don't really care about the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
but me I don't really care about the
brims<00:01:26.600> if<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.259> looks<00:01:28.470> good<00:01:28.740> I'll<00:01:28.950> wear<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:31.189> but

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
brims if it looks good I'll wear it but

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
brims if it looks good I'll wear it but
then<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> green<00:01:33.030> under<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.659> that's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then they have the green under so that's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.140 
then they have the green under so that's
really<00:01:34.079> good

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.500
