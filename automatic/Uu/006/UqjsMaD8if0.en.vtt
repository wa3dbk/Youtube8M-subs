00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
find out how those sounds or how those

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.220 
find out how those sounds or how those
work<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:39.120> far<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.630> weight<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.110> this

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
work so as far as the weight of this

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.580 
work so as far as the weight of this
unit<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:41.130> 8.5<00:03:41.880> ounces<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
unit is just 8.5 ounces and the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.410 
unit is just 8.5 ounces and the
thickness<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.640> third<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.060> an<00:03:45.180> inch

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
thickness is just one third of an inch

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.050 
thickness is just one third of an inch
so<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> really<00:03:46.080> thin<00:03:46.470> device<00:03:47.060> really

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
so it's a really thin device really

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.300 
so it's a really thin device really
really<00:03:48.209> thin<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.110> really<00:03:49.440> light<00:03:49.799> device<00:03:50.130> so

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
really thin and really light device so

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.890 
really thin and really light device so
it's<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.180> great<00:03:51.540> for
