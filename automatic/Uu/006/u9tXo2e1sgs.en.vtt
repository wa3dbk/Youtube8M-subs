00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
at this trying to match it up and then

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.280 
at this trying to match it up and then
realize<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.180> put<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.419> together<00:03:42.510> wrong<00:03:42.840> from<00:03:43.079> one

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
realize I put it together wrong from one

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:56.390 
realize I put it together wrong from one
and<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.129> look<00:03:46.099> wrong<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.280> there

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
and then look wrong that's it so there

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.550 
and then look wrong that's it so there
you<00:03:56.489> go<00:03:56.699> it<00:03:57.689> could<00:03:57.840> go<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.079> other<00:03:58.109> way<00:03:58.260> too<00:03:58.349> I

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
you go it could go the other way too I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.349 
you go it could go the other way too I
guess<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.919> can<00:03:59.099> flip<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.819> all<00:03:59.969> around<00:04:00.180> and
