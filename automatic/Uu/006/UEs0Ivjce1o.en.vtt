rollouts<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.880> basically<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.240> using

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
rollouts so this is basically like using

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.759 
rollouts so this is basically like using
the<00:00:21.660> wheel<00:00:21.840> at<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> gym<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> little

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the wheel at the gym but it's a little

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.890 
the wheel at the gym but it's a little
safer<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.279> started<00:00:23.640> hits<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.300> abs<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
safer to get started hits your abs and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.029 
safer to get started hits your abs and
obliques<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.650> resisting

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
obliques because you're resisting

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
obliques because you're resisting
rotation<00:00:26.519> even<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.210> lower<00:00:27.390> back

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
rotation even a little bit in lower back

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.000 
rotation even a little bit in lower back

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
and then after that we're gonna follow

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
and then after that we're gonna follow
it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> gluts<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
little easier you bring the ball close

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
little easier you bring the ball close
with<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.869> difficult<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
with you to make it more difficult you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.580 
with you to make it more difficult you
push<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> ball<00:01:52.950> further<00:01:53.369> away<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> start<00:01:54.590> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
push the ball further away to start and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170 
push the ball further away to start and
that<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.829> they're<00:01:55.979> less<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> your<00:01:56.520> forearm<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that way they're less of your forearm is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.550 
that way they're less of your forearm is
on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> ball<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> end<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.259> obviously

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
on the ball at the end and obviously

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.389 
on the ball at the end and obviously
that's<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.369> harder

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that's gonna make it a lot harder

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
that's gonna make it a lot harder
because<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> support<00:02:00.960> yourself

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
because all you have to support yourself

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
because all you have to support yourself
are<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.860> abs<00:02:02.040> core<00:02:02.490> muscles<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.060> hands

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
are your abs core muscles in your hands

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.490 
are your abs core muscles in your hands

hamstrings those muscles basically a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.970 
hamstrings those muscles basically a
secondary<00:02:45.450> muscle<00:02:45.780> groups<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.709> glutes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
secondary muscle groups to the glutes

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.170 
secondary muscle groups to the glutes
which<00:02:47.189> are<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.400> main<00:02:47.459> extensors<00:02:48.060> that

hips down towards the floor slowly and

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.490 
hips down towards the floor slowly and
then<00:02:53.970> come<00:02:54.120> back<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.299> straight<00:02:54.750> that's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
then come back up straight that's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.550 
then come back up straight that's
perfect<00:02:55.980> good<00:02:56.159> come<00:02:56.579> down<00:02:56.760> slow<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.389> back<00:02:58.349> up

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
basically don't want the ball to move if

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.259 
basically don't want the ball to move if
you're<00:03:01.650> doing<00:03:01.829> this<00:03:01.980> exercise<00:03:02.340> correctly<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
you're doing this exercise correctly the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.789 
you're doing this exercise correctly the
ball<00:03:03.450> stays<00:03:03.780> positioned<00:03:04.379> under<00:03:04.680> your

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
ball stays positioned under your

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.709 
ball stays positioned under your
shoulders<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.159> head<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.579> back<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.389> you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
shoulders and head and back up if you

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.539 
shoulders and head and back up if you
feel<00:03:07.019> your<00:03:07.230> back<00:03:07.349> touching<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.829> ball<00:03:08.040> your

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
feel your back touching the ball your

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.679 
feel your back touching the ball your
mid-back<00:03:08.849> what<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.060> want<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.239> do<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:09.389> roll<00:03:09.540> up

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
mid-back what you want to do is roll up

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.409 
mid-back what you want to do is roll up
further<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.169> ball<00:03:10.760> good<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.909> then<00:03:12.209> that

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
further on the ball good and then that

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.240 
further on the ball good and then that
way<00:03:12.540> then<00:03:12.689> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> sink<00:03:13.169> down<00:03:13.439> and<00:03:13.739> press<00:03:14.069> up

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
way then you can sink down and press up

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.039 
way then you can sink down and press up
so<00:03:14.700> every<00:03:14.939> time<00:03:15.060> she<00:03:15.150> sinks<00:03:15.569> down<00:03:15.719> she's

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
so every time she sinks down she's

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.149 
so every time she sinks down she's
letting<00:03:16.260> things<00:03:16.379> relax<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.919> then<00:03:17.010> she's

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
letting things relax and then she's

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.069 
letting things relax and then she's
squeezing<00:03:17.459> her<00:03:17.609> glutes<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:18.090> push<00:03:18.269> back<00:03:18.479> up<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
squeezing her glutes to push back up so

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
squeezing her glutes to push back up so
down<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.799> then<00:03:20.280> push<00:03:20.489> back<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.729> opens<00:03:21.269> up<00:03:21.389> your

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510

muscles here in the front that you can

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.330 
muscles here in the front that you can
see<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> mirror<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.650> neglects<00:03:38.159> all

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
see in the mirror and that neglects all

see in the mirror and that neglects all
these<00:03:38.519> strong<00:03:38.849> muscles<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.359> back<00:03:39.540> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
these strong muscles in the back that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.599

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
push them a little further out good and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.319 
push them a little further out good and
that's<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.519> roll<00:03:47.729> back<00:03:48.090> up

that's it and then you just roll back up
and<00:03:48.479> reverse<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.709> what<00:03:49.889> we<00:03:50.040> basically<00:03:50.069> did<00:03:50.639> was

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
and reverse so what we basically did was

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.509 
and reverse so what we basically did was
AB<00:03:51.269> rollouts<00:03:52.139> for<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.470> core<00:03:52.709> oblique<00:03:53.099> muscles

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
AB rollouts for the core oblique muscles

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.039 
AB rollouts for the core oblique muscles
a<00:03:53.579> little<00:03:53.849> bit<00:03:53.939> in<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.060> lower<00:03:54.209> back<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:54.780> then

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
a little bit in the lower back and then

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.839 
a little bit in the lower back and then
we<00:03:55.109> did<00:03:55.259> this<00:03:55.349> great<00:03:55.680> secondary<00:03:56.250> muscle<00:03:56.669> on

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
we did this great secondary muscle on

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.300 
we did this great secondary muscle on
the<00:03:56.909> secondary<00:03:57.290> exercise<00:03:58.290> which<00:03:58.889> works<00:03:59.129> your

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
the secondary exercise which works your

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.770 
the secondary exercise which works your
glutes<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.759> lower<00:03:59.939> back<00:04:00.120> called<00:04:00.509> dynamic

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
glutes and lower back called dynamic

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.960 
glutes and lower back called dynamic
ball<00:04:01.199> bridging<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.069> those<00:04:02.250> two<00:04:02.400> exercises<00:04:02.639> a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
ball bridging so those two exercises a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.610 
ball bridging so those two exercises a
complete<00:04:03.359> core<00:04:03.569> workout<00:04:03.959> can<00:04:04.199> add<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
complete core workout can add it to the
