it so question of the day last time was

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
it so question of the day last time was
what's<00:01:20.880> new<00:01:21.240> machines<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
what's new machines would you like to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.670 
what's new machines would you like to
see<00:01:23.250> added<00:01:23.520> into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.240> game<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:25.020> most<00:01:25.229> popular

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

answer<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.280> over<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> moat<00:01:26.790> redstone<00:01:27.420> device

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
answer was over a moat redstone device

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
answer was over a moat redstone device
so<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.680> could<00:01:28.920> transmit<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.400> signal<00:01:29.700> from

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
so that you could transmit a signal from

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
so that you could transmit a signal from
one<00:01:30.210> redstone<00:01:30.720> circuit<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.650> another<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
one redstone circuit to another that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
one redstone circuit to another that
would<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.060> cool<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:33.990> also<00:01:34.200> liked<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would be very cool and I also liked the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.370 
would be very cool and I also liked the
idea<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.190> having<00:01:35.510> windmills<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.140> game

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
idea of having windmills in the game

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740 
idea of having windmills in the game
partly<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.280> ties<00:01:38.490> into<00:01:38.760> my<00:01:39.090> idea<00:01:39.510> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
partly because it ties into my idea that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.750 
partly because it ties into my idea that
bread<00:01:40.020> should<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.439> made<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.890> Darwin<00:01:41.520> baked

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
bread should be made from Darwin baked

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.399 
bread should be made from Darwin baked
in<00:01:41.970> an<00:01:42.090> oven<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.570> everything<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> need

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
in an oven and everything and you need

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.920 
in an oven and everything and you need
flour<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> plus<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.299> windmills

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
flour for that plus I think windmills

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
flour for that plus I think windmills
would<00:01:46.170> fit<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.590> Minecraft<00:01:47.280> well<00:01:47.520> nicely<00:01:48.119> as

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
would fit into Minecraft well nicely as

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.330 
would fit into Minecraft well nicely as
well<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.350> today's<00:01:49.680> question<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> day

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
well and so today's question of the day

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
well and so today's question of the day
was<00:01:50.670> suggested<00:01:51.150> by<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.330> lowes<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.409> want

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
was suggested by the lowes and they want

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
was suggested by the lowes and they want
to<00:01:52.650> know<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.880> add<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> new<00:01:54.540> piece<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
to know if you could add a new piece of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.140 
to know if you could add a new piece of
armor<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.830> game<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.670> would<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:56.970> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
armor into the game what would it be and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.270 
armor into the game what would it be and
what<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.810> let<00:01:58.020> us<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
what would it do let us know what it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
what would it do let us know what it
