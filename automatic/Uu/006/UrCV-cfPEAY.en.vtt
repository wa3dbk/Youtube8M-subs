00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
to try to imply right here uh so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:45.280 
to try to imply right here uh so
thinking<00:00:35.630> time<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> work<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.829> this

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:01:05.890 

you

these<00:01:06.900> fingers<00:01:07.500> no<00:01:08.400> music<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:08.970> fingers

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
these fingers no music with my fingers

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.410 
these fingers no music with my fingers
this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.570> point

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
this is that so right now at this point

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.540 
this is that so right now at this point
so<00:01:18.740> headphone<00:01:19.740> EVA<00:01:19.950> foam<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> work<00:01:22.110> with

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.350 

so<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.830> Grangers<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.520> start<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.149> take

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
so see the Grangers on start to take

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.039 

so<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:53.079> gives<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.130> an<00:01:54.159> idea<00:01:54.960> where<00:01:55.960> I'm

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
so this gives you an idea where I'm

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
so this gives you an idea where I'm
going<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:58.210> stuff<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.569> really<00:01:58.780> easy<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.759> shape

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
going that stuff is really easy to shape

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.199 
going that stuff is really easy to shape
now<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.679> problem<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.459> only<00:02:03.579> downside<00:02:04.119> of

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
now the problem is the only downside of

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.029 
now the problem is the only downside of
this<00:02:04.240> well<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.630> makes<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.929> little<00:02:04.990> big<00:02:05.350> mess<00:02:05.709> and

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
this well it makes a little big mess and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.619 
this well it makes a little big mess and
the<00:02:06.069> secondly<00:02:06.609> it's<00:02:07.539> very<00:02:07.869> fragile<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.629> till

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
the secondly it's very fragile so till

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.570 
the secondly it's very fragile so till
you<00:02:10.720> get<00:02:10.869> your<00:02:12.030> top<00:02:13.030> coat<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.420> paint<00:02:13.629> on<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.959> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
you get your top coat of paint on it and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.559 
you get your top coat of paint on it and
end<00:02:15.580> or<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:16.420> other<00:02:16.510> kind<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.780> ground<00:02:17.349> goop<00:02:17.739> to

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
end or some other kind of ground goop to

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.460 
end or some other kind of ground goop to
firm<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.599> up<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.900> little<00:02:20.019> bit<00:02:20.230> you're<00:02:20.349> gonna

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
firm it up a little bit you're gonna

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.030 
firm it up a little bit you're gonna
want<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.739> be<00:02:20.829> careful<00:02:21.040> about<00:02:22.829> dropping<00:02:23.829> things

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
want to be careful about dropping things

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.210 
want to be careful about dropping things
on<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.090> want<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.450> watch<00:02:25.810> me<00:02:26.099> go<00:02:27.099> ahead

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
on it and I want to watch me go ahead

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.729 
on it and I want to watch me go ahead
and<00:02:27.400> put<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.569> poke<00:02:29.019> my<00:02:29.170> finger<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and put this just poke my finger in it

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.300 
and put this just poke my finger in it
like<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.620> downside<00:02:32.829> to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
like that so that's the downside to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.650 
like that so that's the downside to
using<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.730> florist<00:02:34.450> foam<00:02:34.829> whoa<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:37.540> you

using the florist foam whoa make you
seasick<00:02:38.079> there<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:42.269> let<00:02:43.269> me<00:02:43.299> Mull<00:02:43.569> this<00:02:43.599> over

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
seasick there so let me Mull this over

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.710 
seasick there so let me Mull this over
some<00:02:44.319> more<00:02:45.060> think<00:02:46.060> about<00:02:46.269> what<00:02:46.420> I've<00:02:46.540> done<00:02:46.720> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
some more think about what I've done and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.729 
some more think about what I've done and
decide<00:02:49.720> what<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:49.959> going<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.140> start<00:02:50.349> painting

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
decide what I'm going to start painting

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:00.080 
decide what I'm going to start painting
yet<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:56.200> right<00:02:56.849> broke<00:02:57.849> up<00:02:58.000> my<00:02:58.150> old<00:02:59.040> can<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
yet so all right broke up my old can of

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.960 
yet so all right broke up my old can of
latex<00:03:01.090> paint<00:03:02.220> same<00:03:03.220> stuff<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.549> use<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
latex paint same stuff I use for the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.409 
latex paint same stuff I use for the
mountains<00:03:04.389> and<00:03:05.970> looks<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.090> it's<00:03:07.239> still

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
mountains and looks like it's still

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.460 
mountains and looks like it's still
usable<00:03:07.919> I'm<00:03:08.919> just<00:03:09.130> gonna<00:03:10.290> paint

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
usable I'm just gonna paint

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.770 
usable I'm just gonna paint
the<00:03:12.830> phone<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.700> strongly<00:03:14.120> suspect<00:03:14.450> that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the phone and I strongly suspect that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.850 
the phone and I strongly suspect that
this<00:03:14.990> stuff<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.410> gonna<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:16.570> absorb<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:18.260> lot

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
this stuff is gonna really absorb a lot

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.500 
this stuff is gonna really absorb a lot
of<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> paint<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.820> paint<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.390> do

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
of the paint so you paint that you do

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.690 
of the paint so you paint that you do
put<00:03:23.780> down<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:26.060> top<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.370> I'm<00:03:28.370> using<00:03:28.550> a

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
put down on top of this and I'm using a

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:39.550 
put down on top of this and I'm using a
lot<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:32.410> we<00:03:33.410> need<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.560> be<00:03:33.620> true<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:38.560> if

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
lot of it we need to be true and if

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.820 
lot of it we need to be true and if
you're<00:03:40.190> using<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:40.940> kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.270> foam<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.930> you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
you're using this kind of foam and you

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.740 
you're using this kind of foam and you
paint<00:03:43.040> over<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.910> always<00:03:44.060> add<00:03:44.390> you

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
paint over it and you can always add you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.720 
paint over it and you can always add you
want<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.020> add<00:03:45.110> rock<00:03:45.459> outcroppings<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.610> can

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
want to add rock outcroppings you can

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.370 
want to add rock outcroppings you can
make<00:03:46.850> some<00:03:47.030> castings<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.690> just<00:03:47.870> glue<00:03:48.050> them<00:03:48.230> on

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
make some castings and just glue them on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.720 
make some castings and just glue them on
to<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.370> foam<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:52.160> fairly

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
to the foam and that's fairly

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:21.910 
to the foam and that's fairly
straightforward<00:03:53.390> really<00:03:53.930> easy<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.230> do

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.350 

I'm<00:04:22.920> going<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:25.190> refrain<00:04:26.190> from<00:04:26.240> painting<00:04:27.240> this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
I'm going to refrain from painting this

paint something I'm going to take off
anyway<00:05:13.140> but<00:05:13.410> it'll<00:05:13.620> be<00:05:13.650> scenic<00:05:14.250> more<00:05:14.490> or<00:05:14.580> less

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
anyway but it'll be scenic more or less

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.110 
anyway but it'll be scenic more or less
up<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.090> up<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.390> there<00:05:15.690> so<00:05:19.130> yeah<00:05:20.130> that's<00:05:20.940> the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
up to up to there so yeah that's the

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.860 
up to up to there so yeah that's the
plan<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:29.460> need<00:05:29.640> to<00:05:29.730> give<00:05:29.880> this<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.090> second

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
plan so you need to give this a second

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.120 
plan so you need to give this a second
coat<00:05:31.050> or<00:05:31.260> not<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.870> really<00:05:34.080> seal<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:34.920> all

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
to make sure this is all sealed off

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:59.300 
to make sure this is all sealed off
completely<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:52.740> but<00:05:56.249> anyway<00:05:57.300> that's<00:05:58.300> what's

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
completely so but anyway that's what's

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.219 
completely so but anyway that's what's
going<00:06:00.310> on<00:06:00.460> when<00:06:00.729> you<00:06:00.789> take<00:06:00.939> you<00:06:01.060> over<00:06:01.150> here<00:06:01.689> to

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.600 
going on when you take you over here to
the<00:06:02.349> road<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:02.800> think<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:03.009> showed<00:06:03.189> you<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.430> road

the road I think I showed you the road

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.350 
the road I think I showed you the road
the<00:06:03.729> last<00:06:03.939> time<00:06:06.539> and<00:06:08.550> where<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:09.669> was<00:06:09.789> still<00:06:10.060> a

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
the last time and where it was still a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.989 
the last time and where it was still a
little<00:06:14.219> wear<00:06:15.219> this<00:06:15.340> stuff<00:06:15.580> still<00:06:15.819> was<00:06:15.969> a

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:15.999 
little wear this stuff still was a

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.899 
little wear this stuff still was a
little<00:06:16.210> bit<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:17.740> thicker<00:06:17.919> part<00:06:18.069> here<00:06:18.550> was<00:06:18.879> a

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
little bit the thicker part here was a

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.689 
little bit the thicker part here was a
different<00:06:19.240> color<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:19.949> it's<00:06:20.949> dried<00:06:21.189> nicely

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
different color and it's dried nicely

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.390 
different color and it's dried nicely
and<00:06:21.939> this<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.319> it's<00:06:23.319> got<00:06:23.439> some<00:06:23.680> variation

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
and this is a it's got some variation

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.339 
and this is a it's got some variation
but<00:06:24.580> not<00:06:24.759> as<00:06:24.909> radical<00:06:25.120> as<00:06:25.389> it<00:06:25.539> did<00:06:25.689> before<00:06:25.779> and

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
but not as radical as it did before and

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.010 
but not as radical as it did before and
of<00:06:26.860> course<00:06:26.919> we<00:06:27.279> want<00:06:27.460> some<00:06:27.759> natural<00:06:28.120> variation

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
of course we want some natural variation

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.290 
of course we want some natural variation
in<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.139> color<00:06:29.229> of<00:06:29.499> the<00:06:29.650> road<00:06:29.909> they<00:06:30.909> also<00:06:31.089> got

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.659 
in the color of the road they also got
my<00:06:31.449> first<00:06:32.279> crack<00:06:33.279> in<00:06:33.520> here<00:06:34.560> you<00:06:35.560> can<00:06:35.740> see<00:06:35.979> and

my first crack in here you can see and

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.570 
my first crack in here you can see and
that's<00:06:36.819> uh<00:06:37.120> that's<00:06:37.830> because<00:06:38.830> Oh<00:06:39.629> get<00:06:40.629> this

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580

that's uh that's because Oh get this
focused<00:06:42.580> right<00:06:43.110> that's<00:06:44.110> because<00:06:44.439> this<00:06:44.620> is<00:06:44.740> on

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
focused right that's because this is on

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.070 
focused right that's because this is on
a<00:06:44.889> seam<00:06:45.219> here<00:06:45.249> that's<00:06:45.639> why<00:06:45.789> this<00:06:45.849> cracked<00:06:46.330> but

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
a seam here that's why this cracked but

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.290 
a seam here that's why this cracked but
that's<00:06:47.259> fine<00:06:47.499> you<00:06:48.039> know<00:06:48.250> I<00:06:48.460> want<00:06:48.879> some<00:06:49.120> wear

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
that's fine you know I want some wear

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.700 
that's fine you know I want some wear
and<00:06:49.330> tear<00:06:49.509> in<00:06:50.520> my<00:06:52.289> pavements<00:06:53.289> so<00:06:53.439> this<00:06:53.620> is

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
and tear in my pavements so this is

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.559 
and tear in my pavements so this is
going<00:06:53.830> to<00:06:53.889> look<00:06:54.009> perfectly<00:06:54.729> natural<00:06:54.969> having

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
going to look perfectly natural having

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.179 
going to look perfectly natural having
this<00:06:55.659> crack<00:06:55.990> in<00:06:56.229> here<00:06:56.409> with<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.649> scenery<00:06:56.889> all

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 
this crack in here with the scenery all

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.579 
this crack in here with the scenery all
around<00:06:57.580> it<00:06:57.789> so<00:06:58.050> that's<00:06:59.050> going<00:06:59.169> to<00:06:59.229> work<00:06:59.379> out

00:06:59.579 --> 00:06:59.589 
around it so that's going to work out

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:05.369 
around it so that's going to work out
pretty<00:07:00.520> cool<00:07:00.899> so<00:07:01.899> I<00:07:01.930> think<00:07:02.259> I<00:07:04.020> think<00:07:05.020> that's<00:07:05.169> it

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379 
pretty cool so I think I think that's it

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.369 
pretty cool so I think I think that's it
for<00:07:05.409> now<00:07:05.710> or<00:07:06.479> shaping<00:07:07.479> the<00:07:07.689> foam<00:07:07.930> I<00:07:08.110> gotta<00:07:08.289> let

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
for now or shaping the foam I gotta let

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.369 
for now or shaping the foam I gotta let
this<00:07:08.529> dry<00:07:08.830> so<00:07:09.310> I'm<00:07:09.669> gonna<00:07:09.789> have<00:07:09.939> to<00:07:10.379> somehow

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:11.379 
this dry so I'm gonna have to somehow
