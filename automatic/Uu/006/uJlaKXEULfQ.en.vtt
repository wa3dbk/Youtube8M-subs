 Amoumu, The sad mummy 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 Perhaps one of the strangest champions in the Legends League is the Jordan named Amumu. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 His life before joining the League remains a mystery ... especially for Amu. All he remembers is that he woke himself alone in the pyramid in the Shurima desert 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 He was wrapped in mummification bandages and could not feel the blows of his heart. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 Moreover, he felt a deep sadness he could not fully explain, feeling the lack of his parents, but unable to remember who they were. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Amoum fell to his knees and wept in his bandages. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 No matter what he was doing, it seemed he could never stop his tears. After a while he stood up, determined to go around the world and discover his past. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Amoum has traveled throughout southern Valoran, an achievement that is not very small. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 While Amuhu still does not know much about his past, he has learned a lot about what he has become. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 It is absolutely certain he is not dead, yet he does not grasp the evil characteristics inherent in these beings. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Also, it seems that it can stand on the side of the misery; Amumu managed to cross the entire Southern Valoran without any harm to him. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 He was just sad, and the people and beings he met soon shared this sadness. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Finally, he made his way through the Great Barrier to the Institute of War, the home of the League. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Amuhu's story intrigued the invitees who met there, and they invited him to join the League. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 His success inside him as a champion, he gave Amoum something that he wanted a cat: home. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 By securing his present (not) life, he now hopes that his new friends will be able to help him in revealing his past. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 "Things are bad when Amuhu is crying, but they are far more terrible when angry." - Azriel
