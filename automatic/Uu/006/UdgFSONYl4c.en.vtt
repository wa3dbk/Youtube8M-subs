scientist dr. Jay Knights Kramer was one
of<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> key<00:02:24.500> players<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.190> development<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of the key players in the development of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.880 
of the key players in the development of
the<00:02:26.060> original<00:02:26.150> octave<00:02:26.900> fade<00:02:27.080> open<00:02:27.470> country

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the original octave fade open country

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.070 
the original octave fade open country
patterns<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.330> difference<00:02:29.569> between<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
patterns so the difference between the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.870 
patterns so the difference between the
the<00:02:30.110> open<00:02:30.500> country<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.980> forest<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.700> mean

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
the open country in the forest I mean

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.100 
the open country in the forest I mean
there's<00:02:32.060> quite<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.300> difference<00:02:32.690> between<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
there's quite a difference between the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.980 
there's quite a difference between the
two<00:02:33.290> what<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.310> yeah<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.730> octave<00:02:35.090> fade<00:02:35.270> open

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
two what is it yeah the octave fade open

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.510 
two what is it yeah the octave fade open
country<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.470> designed<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.190> horizontal

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
country is designed for a horizontal

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.120 
country is designed for a horizontal
environment<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.140> deer's<00:02:39.470> perspective

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
environment so from a deer's perspective

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.500 
environment so from a deer's perspective
and<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.340> colors<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.850> we've<00:02:40.970> done<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.330> there

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and the colors that we've done in there

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.480 
and the colors that we've done in there
they<00:02:42.020> actually<00:02:42.410> pick<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.190> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
they actually pick up on the the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.520 
they actually pick up on the the
horizontal<00:02:44.150> disruption<00:02:44.900> where<00:02:45.410> you're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
horizontal disruption where you're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.590 
horizontal disruption where you're
trying<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.800> chop<00:02:46.069> up<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> human<00:02:46.670> shape<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
trying to chop up the human shape the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.050 
trying to chop up the human shape the
octave<00:02:48.260> fade<00:02:48.410> forest<00:02:48.800> pattern<00:02:49.250> was<00:02:49.640> designed

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
octave fade forest pattern was designed

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.120 
octave fade forest pattern was designed
for<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.330> vertical<00:02:50.630> disruption<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:52.010> you're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
for a vertical disruption because you're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.410 
for a vertical disruption because you're
up<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.430> tree<00:02:52.459> you've<00:02:52.819> got<00:02:52.850> tree<00:02:53.209> bark

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
up in a tree you've got tree bark

trunks running a certain way the deer

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.470 
trunks running a certain way the deer
can<00:02:57.170> see<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.740> this<00:02:57.860> pattern<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:59.330> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
can see that in this pattern and you and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.150 
can see that in this pattern and you and
I<00:02:59.540> may<00:02:59.750> not<00:02:59.780> see<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.319> but<00:03:00.530> they<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.830> sure<00:03:01.010> see

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
I may not see that but they can sure see

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.860 
I may not see that but they can sure see
that<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.640> put<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.030> one<00:03:02.209> out<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.660> an<00:03:02.750> open

that if you put this one out in an open
field<00:03:03.260> they're<00:03:03.950> gonna<00:03:04.100> notice<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.520> difference

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880

counterintuitive happen
one<00:03:16.610> would<00:03:16.790> think<00:03:16.820> looking<00:03:17.750> skyward<00:03:18.110> that

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
one would think looking skyward that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.410 
one would think looking skyward that
everything<00:03:18.890> becomes<00:03:19.160> brighter<00:03:19.520> however

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
everything becomes brighter however

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.080 
everything becomes brighter however
that's<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> case<00:03:21.190> well<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.520> light<00:03:22.880> is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
that's not the case well the light is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.700 
that's not the case well the light is
coming<00:03:23.390> down<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.570> an<00:03:23.840> angle<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:24.380> it's<00:03:24.530> also

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
coming down on an angle but it's also

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.890 
coming down on an angle but it's also
coming<00:03:25.070> through<00:03:25.250> branches<00:03:25.550> past<00:03:26.180> tree<00:03:26.480> trunks

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
coming through branches past tree trunks

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.860 
coming through branches past tree trunks
past<00:03:27.320> leaves<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:29.270> we've<00:03:29.420> done<00:03:29.630> here

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
past leaves and so what we've done here

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.690 
past leaves and so what we've done here
is<00:03:29.990> we've<00:03:30.170> optimized<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:31.010> colors<00:03:31.340> to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
is we've optimized the colors to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.450 
is we've optimized the colors to
simulate<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.480> same<00:03:32.720> effect<00:03:33.050> okay<00:03:33.860> now<00:03:34.370> I

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
simulate that same effect okay now I

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.920 
simulate that same effect okay now I
noticed<00:03:34.820> looking<00:03:34.910> at<00:03:35.090> these<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.570> these<00:03:35.720> are

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
noticed looking at these that these are

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
noticed looking at these that these are
made<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.500> know<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.830> pixels<00:03:37.250> how<00:03:37.820> is

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
made you know with the pixels how is

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.510 
made you know with the pixels how is
that<00:03:38.210> better<00:03:38.450> than<00:03:38.630> say<00:03:38.960> smooth<00:03:39.890> lines<00:03:40.220> and

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
that better than say smooth lines and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.490 
that better than say smooth lines and
curves<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.880> things<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.930> squares

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
curves and things like that the squares

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.380 
curves and things like that the squares
the<00:03:42.620> sharp<00:03:42.980> edges<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.580> squares<00:03:43.880> actually

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
the sharp edges of the squares actually

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.630 
the sharp edges of the squares actually
add<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.960> background<00:03:45.530> noise<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:46.280> if<00:03:46.430> you're

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
add to a background noise that if you're

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.690 
add to a background noise that if you're
focusing<00:03:47.570> on<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.050> object<00:03:48.590> your<00:03:49.280> brain<00:03:49.520> will

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
focusing on the object your brain will

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.490 
focusing on the object your brain will
actually<00:03:50.030> interpret<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.290> sharp

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
actually interpret it the the sharp

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.380 
actually interpret it the the sharp
corners<00:03:51.890> as<00:03:52.100> background<00:03:52.640> noise<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.060> ignore

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
corners as background noise and ignore

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.070

what's<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.200> first<00:04:27.410> thing<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.650> do<00:04:27.770> how<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.040> you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
what's the first thing you do how do you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.130 
what's the first thing you do how do you

the end with you know something like

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.620 
the end with you know something like
this

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
this

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.380 
this
well<00:04:32.870> most<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.860> what<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.610> do<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:35.030> proprietary

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
well most of what we do is proprietary

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.730 
well most of what we do is proprietary
or<00:04:35.990> even<00:04:36.230> classified<00:04:36.860> but<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:38.600> typical<00:04:38.840> runs

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
or even classified but the typical runs

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.800 
or even classified but the typical runs
through<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.310> we<00:04:40.550> look<00:04:40.760> at<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.210> target<00:04:41.720> that

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
through is we look at the target that

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.350 
through is we look at the target that
we're<00:04:41.990> trying<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.290> conceal<00:04:42.850> we<00:04:43.850> look<00:04:44.060> at<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
we're trying to conceal we look at the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.270 
we're trying to conceal we look at the
environment<00:04:44.870> they're<00:04:45.380> gonna<00:04:45.500> operate<00:04:45.920> and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
environment they're gonna operate and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.610 
environment they're gonna operate and
then<00:04:46.430> then<00:04:46.700> we<00:04:46.820> start<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.210> work<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.620> colors

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
then then we start to work on colors

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.080 
then then we start to work on colors
that<00:04:48.830> are<00:04:48.920> going<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.100> work<00:04:49.250> best<00:04:49.520> within<00:04:49.940> that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
that are going to work best within that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.150 
that are going to work best within that
environment<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:51.170> so<00:04:51.440> we<00:04:51.650> have<00:04:51.830> algorithms

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
environment and so we have algorithms

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.580 
environment and so we have algorithms
that<00:04:52.610> will<00:04:52.760> actually<00:04:52.970> take<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.930> colors<00:04:54.290> of

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
that will actually take the colors of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.650 
that will actually take the colors of
the<00:04:54.710> backgrounds<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.370> we<00:04:55.550> use<00:04:55.820> something

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
the backgrounds and we use something

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.050 
the backgrounds and we use something
called<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:57.080> spectrometer<00:04:57.500> which<00:04:58.430> will<00:04:58.670> tell<00:04:58.910> us

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
called a spectrometer which will tell us

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.930 
called a spectrometer which will tell us
the<00:04:59.180> exact<00:04:59.510> colors<00:04:59.810> that<00:05:00.020> we're<00:05:00.140> looking<00:05:00.290> at

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
the exact colors that we're looking at

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.180 
the exact colors that we're looking at
with<00:05:01.940> fine<00:05:02.210> detail<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.810> then<00:05:03.440> we<00:05:03.590> pump<00:05:03.950> that

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
with fine detail and then we pump that

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.780 
with fine detail and then we pump that
into<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.640> series<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.890> photos<00:05:06.890> images<00:05:07.580> or
