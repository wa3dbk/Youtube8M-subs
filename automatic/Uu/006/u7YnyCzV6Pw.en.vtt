00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.480
 hi friends how are we in some 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.010
 Sometimes I bring a boxing and revised 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.190
 some products that have sent us in the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.980
 company pro port spain and good 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.670
 we have here some cases for iphone 55 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.670
 We have here another one for iphone 55 s 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.280
 I like being a parent is that style as 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.930
 old as worn I do not like 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.050
 much in the covers it is made that they look 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 enough parents and we have is for ipad 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.520
 mini and ipad mini retina I would like 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.549
 start with this one time 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.039
 let's start the revised and good this 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.579
 in what we open it let me here 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.179
 we would also like to thank you 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.549
 to proporta espaÃ±a since this was the 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.610
 first company that trusted me to 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.459
 Do your revisions already quite 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.759
 the pro porter company sent me 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.740
 some covers to start making some 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.049
 reviewed and well then from there 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 thankfully and thanks to you 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.909
 we have also followed the colors 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.679
 collaborations without stopping with them and 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.439
 Well, this time it's time to do the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.229
 revised to these covers and see my 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.750
 entrance this case looks amazing at 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.049
 touch is very soft is like a style like that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.519
 like from a quilt like that very soft thing 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.700
 these little bubbles of air are 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.739
 incredible is not that this is a case 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.049
 of truly premium if you want that 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 protect your ipad and make it look elegant 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:26.390
 this is for you see let's open it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.060
 but as it is magnetized see 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 so you 're not going to need the typical 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 correct that it sticks because this is 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.670
 magnetized and you can also stop 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 here we have the two positions nothing more 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.740
 you can stop in two positions here 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.560
 crashes but well let's try it now 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.480
 what is the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 the ipad mini with the case 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.870
 I guess there should not be any problems 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.680
 to put it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.010
 nothing else we put we see that it is closed 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.239
 well and this we put it behind the ipad and 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.510
 ready see the volume entry here 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.590
 we have a unique super wide cut no 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.780
 We will have no volume problem 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.540
 without any problem on the part of 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.970
 down we found in our speakers 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.379
 He also connected online a unique cut of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.829
 this side, we do not find anything is 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.620
 a kind of book and over here 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.720
 we found our 3.5 connector our 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.819
 microphone the space by the microphone and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.500
 we found the power button I guess 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.430
 as it is magnetized it has to be a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.599
 kind of smart if they see we close it 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.950
 turns off 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.950
 we open it turns on 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 quite father now let's try the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.489
 positions in which you can put 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.769
 this is la 1 let's say it like that to see 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.120
 a movie very comfortably or two this 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.610
 I believe that there is a little more to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.700
 to write 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.810
 but it works the right way and 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.270
 adequate 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.350
 I tell you guys inside is super 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.060
 soft we see this finish in pictures 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.180
 quite elegant and quite beautiful and 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.370
 We are found outside cover 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.710
 pada good as quilted as with 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.650
 little bubbles of air here we find bar 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.230
 bowl and really ready friends to see and 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.510
 for the camera a super wide hole 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.510
 for the camera so you do not have any 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.169
 problem when taking photos this 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.290
 is simply amazing friends is very 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.880
 elegant the cover pretty father in 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.530
 I truly believe that it is one of the most 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 elegant and prettier than I could 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.180
 see why because we make a sincere 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.490
 thing is that it is elegant another thing is 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 that gives you protection and something else 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.660
 it look as youthful but 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.760
 if we speak in elegant cases I think 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.060
 this is the nicest I have 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.470
 could see is if it is definitely 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.350
 of the most beautiful covers I could 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.690
 see if you drop the ipad we can have 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.000
 the certainty that he will not touch the 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.750
 shores since as we can see here 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.080
 always leave a space so that when 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.330
 fall touch the case first and do not touch 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.850
 the ipad on the top we can 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.070
 see exactly the same thing we have this 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.169
 relief that will not allow you to touch 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.940
 directly our floor ipad but 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.760
 let the case fall first and 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.919
 then it can and fall these 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.410
 small air bubbles and good friends 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.510
 as always this case can be 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.490
 you all we need is that we 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.400
 we get to 350 likes what do you think 350 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.780
