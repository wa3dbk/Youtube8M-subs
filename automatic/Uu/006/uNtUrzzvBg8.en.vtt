00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
last map but certainly disappointment is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.009 
last map but certainly disappointment is
all<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.519> let's<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:27.019> we

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
all they can think of but let's see we

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.669 
all they can think of but let's see we
are<00:00:28.490> right<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:30.119> their<00:00:30.300> faces<00:00:30.750> sk<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
are right from their faces sk have a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
are right from their faces sk have a
wealth<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> experience<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.899> final

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
wealth of experience so in this final

wealth of experience so in this final
round<00:00:34.559> they<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> edge<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
round they just might have the edge you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.180 
round they just might have the edge you
know<00:00:37.350> whereas<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.910> might<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:40.190> massive

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

relies<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> sit<00:00:58.500> defensive<00:00:59.070> now

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
relies is going to sit defensive now

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580 
relies is going to sit defensive now
same<00:01:00.059> position<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:00.629> sk<00:01:01.109> won<00:01:01.350> their<00:01:01.559> last

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
same position where sk won their last

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.609

match but zom isn't going to go get

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
match but zom isn't going to go get
involved<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.820> chances<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.420> we're<00:01:06.600> going

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
involved so the chances are we're going

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
involved so the chances are we're going
to<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.960> both<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> mages<00:01:08.070> open<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.520> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to have both of the mages open up this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.690 
to have both of the mages open up this
fight<00:01:08.960> another<00:01:09.960> seems<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.220> lot<00:01:11.670> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
fight another seems a lot more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.090 
fight another seems a lot more
aggressive<00:01:12.390> than<00:01:13.170> red<00:01:13.770> hot<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.250> mousesports

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
aggressive than red hot from mousesports

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
aggressive than red hot from mousesports

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
realizer actually just had to blow his

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.070 
realizer actually just had to blow his
sprint<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.950> avoid<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> blizzard<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.600> two

sprint there to avoid a blizzard so two

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.230

minutes<00:01:22.409> remaining<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> sprint<00:01:23.670> will

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
minutes remaining on that sprint will

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
minutes remaining on that sprint will
they<00:01:24.420> choose<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.869> wait<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> out<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.130> know

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
they choose to wait it out or you know

we'll say it I think it will all come
down<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> stealth<00:01:29.520> buffs<00:01:29.790> yeah

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
down to the stealth buffs yeah

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
down to the stealth buffs yeah
personally<00:01:30.720> Sprint's<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.680> useful<00:01:32.070> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
personally Sprint's very useful for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.850 
personally Sprint's very useful for
rogues<00:01:32.460> especially<00:01:32.970> defensively<00:01:33.619> in<00:01:34.619> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
rogues especially defensively in this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
rogues especially defensively in this
lineup<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.670> actually<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.150> away<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.630> actually

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
lineup to actually get away and actually

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.569 
lineup to actually get away and actually
that's<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> break<00:01:37.619> relies<00:01:38.009> around<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that's going to break relies around it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.380 
that's going to break relies around it
