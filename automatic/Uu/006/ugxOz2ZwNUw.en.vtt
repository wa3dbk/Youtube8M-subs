00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello to all that yellow guy and i'm 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.349
 finally another with this new one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.910
 video I am a very ugly person 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.590
 because they are so many days that not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 I load a standard comment we say 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 given that among the insane nuclear in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 live which is practically not a comment 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 of series as usual they really are 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.580
 so many days that I make myself feel in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 so decent so boh I ask you 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.090
 how it was and hope all is well here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 all right, what if there is something here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.869
 front we are not on black ops two we are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.399
 on the minus three for the simple fact that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 many where they asked if 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.110
 I could bring an old moab anyway 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 can make some new ones and leave out 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 the sincere people are back on mv 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
 three weeks ago he did some 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.430
 game came somehow nice 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 this the fastest one I was 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 capitata so nothing collected 1 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 scarella I started with 1 m plus 9 mp 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.699
 I made the world of it so I didn't 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 seems to have to explain to you to give you some 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.300
 junk advice varies because so much of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 fashions you've seen in packages from me 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.190
 so i think you're used to it and a little bit 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 of things to talk about today I have little 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.890
 time so I'll try to hurry up and then 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.900
 first seen that many of you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 they keep asking me why Mormon 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 black ops two maybe tired after a while 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 because however we say only for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.320
 build a game a little slower 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 compared to menu 3 in the sense to see a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 bmw 3 gameplay in my opinion is a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 a little bit more adrenaline can be said 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 so I don't know anyway, in my opinion it is a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.159
 little bit more fun while in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 this time I'm not playing every 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.990
 so 3 square meters when it happens to me and I go there 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.329
 sometimes there is always the usual shit of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
 human type of the dead last hope e 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
 all things broke out if that gives a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 annoyance but I enjoy it anyway 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
 let's say the difference a lot 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.049
 compared to black ops 2 where mine 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 connection makes it much much less 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.380
 I respect that this game I don't know for 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.659
 what reason anyway to play on this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.399
 I like playing a bit more though 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 may seem strange because we were 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.600
 left last year obviously saying 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.430
 that is, whenever the new cod comes out, yes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.380
 criticizes the new one and says it is 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.820
 nice old one though i think that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
 just got used to it 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 however for me it is not a regret 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.159
 return to making videos every so often smau between 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.079
 and so I thought and let me know in you 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.720
 comments if you care because if you do n't 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.220
 know you and do nothing 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 if you can please them every so often go to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.240
 verona of an episode of maybe this 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520
 polo which is not episode 1 random is indeed 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.040
 episode 0 random a new episode 0 e 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.440
 if you like it maybe every now and then I bring you 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 a mob that I maybe go into a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.220
 started from any weapon whatsoever 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.660
 random and can make it mob maybe 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.130
 much but I see if I can do it 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.870
 I don't even know one live 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 however let me know if the thing there 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.650
 interested maybe load a video like 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.340
 a bike every now and then may not be for 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 it's nice 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.620
 how many times have I said maybe I am 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.200
 maybe video maybe just say maybe 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.610
 anyway, I have to thank you too 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.790
 very much because we arrived at 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.530
 touch almost a thousand likes on the south and mind 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.510
 ig that is something shocking because 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 I had never come so close to myself 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 a thousand so thanks to everyone really 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 this makes me understand that the series is there 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.830
 series the episode liked so there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.709
 I'm working I'm working on 2 and levi 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.120
 on two precisely it is one of the reasons why 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.970
 I'm taking so long to bring videos 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.630
 because we say that mount a video of the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.920
 it's not easy at all because 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.720
 only one type of frame change 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.970
 because I have to put the writing below 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.860
 every time like all things 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.410
 you have to make yourself a structured ladder 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.269
 then an episode based on the pieces 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.920
 I have I have to register type all the time 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.720
 and a half game in which game then go 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.250
 to listen to cut the pieces so it is 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.430
 a really long thing in my opinion 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.100
 however since you like it I will continue to 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.620
 do it and we hope you can still enjoy it 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.880
 so I don't know I think it's a little bit 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.830
 that's all 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.360
 I have no others with I have no other things to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.209
 tell you I have no advice to give for the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.890
 fashions so nothing I think is almost everything 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.330
 actually all here so guys that 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.860
 still thank you if you feel like it 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.450
 be a comment I like you not 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.390
 I ask for a number of like because 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.640
 I never did it, I don't know if it's beautiful 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.140
 do it though if you want to leave me a 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.390
 like a comment see you next 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.390
