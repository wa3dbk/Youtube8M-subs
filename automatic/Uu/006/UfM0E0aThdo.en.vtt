lines for your life well we're going to
take<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:09.989> strong<00:02:10.259> tie<00:02:10.979> wraps<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
take some really strong tie wraps and

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.370 
take some really strong tie wraps and
we're<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> tie<00:02:12.000> wrap<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:13.110> four

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
we're going to tie wrap it on all four

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890 
we're going to tie wrap it on all four
points<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.880> actually<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
points and it's actually going to be a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
points and it's actually going to be a
really<00:02:16.200> nice<00:02:16.470> installation<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:17.459> what's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really nice installation because what's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.240 
really nice installation because what's
going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> happen<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.959> because<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.040> tie

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
going to happen is because it's on tie

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.100 
going to happen is because it's on tie
wraps<00:02:20.579> it's<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.810> better

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
wraps it's actually going to be better

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
wraps it's actually going to be better
on<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.470> unit<00:02:22.769> because<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.579> be

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
on the unit because it's not going to be

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.069 
on the unit because it's not going to be
slam<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.299> it's<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.750> more<00:02:24.959> of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
slam it up it's going to have more of

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.759 
slam it up it's going to have more of
like<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:26.420> shock<00:02:27.420> absorber<00:02:27.450> effect<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.650> it's

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
like a shock absorber effect and it's

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.170 
like a shock absorber effect and it's
actually<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> be<00:02:29.310> better<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.910> unit

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
actually going to be better for the unit

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.370 
actually going to be better for the unit
so<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.079> be<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.290> more

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so it's going to be a little more

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020 
so it's going to be a little more
trouble<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.860> solve<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.370> way<00:02:32.549> but<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.910> going

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
trouble to solve this way but it's going

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.670 
trouble to solve this way but it's going
to<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.360> good<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.049> operate<00:02:34.440> good

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to look good it's going to operate good

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880 
to look good it's going to operate good
and<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:36.180> owner<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.349> boats<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.799> be

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and the owner of the boats going to be

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.619 
and the owner of the boats going to be
able<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> see<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.459> product<00:02:38.819> really<00:02:39.060> well<00:02:39.299> and

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
able to see the product really well and

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.509 
able to see the product really well and
see<00:02:39.810> how<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.079> working<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.500> all<00:02:40.650> times<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
see how it's working at all times so

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.280 
see how it's working at all times so
we're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> find<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.690> right<00:02:42.810> down<00:02:42.989> down

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
we're going to find it right down down

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.059 
we're going to find it right down down
here

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
here

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
battery that goes to the negative then

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.319 
battery that goes to the negative then
direct<00:03:16.079> enthralling<00:03:16.530> motor<00:03:16.799> battery<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.670> you

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
direct enthralling motor battery if you

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.059 
direct enthralling motor battery if you
have<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> 36-hole<00:03:19.140> system<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> works<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.040> same

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
have a 36-hole system it works the same

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.309 
have a 36-hole system it works the same
way<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:21.209> you're<00:03:21.359> doing<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.750> putting<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.079> third

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
way all you're doing is putting a third

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.199 
way all you're doing is putting a third
battery<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.829> middle<00:03:23.129> so<00:03:23.519> let's<00:03:23.730> find<00:03:23.970> out

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
battery in the middle so let's find out

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.470 
battery in the middle so let's find out
which<00:03:24.780> batteries<00:03:25.230> hook<00:03:25.980> up<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.340> which<00:03:27.239> wire

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
which batteries hook up to which wire

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420 
which batteries hook up to which wire
and<00:03:28.049> we're<00:03:28.200> going<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.349> go<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.590> okay<00:03:29.280> we've

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
and we're going to go in okay we've

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
and we're going to go in okay we've
we've<00:03:29.879> located<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.450> batteries<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:30.959> now<00:03:31.079> what

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
we've located the batteries so now what

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.539 
we've located the batteries so now what
we're<00:03:31.349> going<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.590> do<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.829> we're<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.220> take

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.179 
we're going to do is we're going to take
the<00:03:32.840> cables<00:03:33.840> off<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.200> battery<00:03:34.500> number<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.889> and

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
the cables off of battery number one and

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.440 
the cables off of battery number one and
we're<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.430> hook<00:03:35.549> up<00:03:35.730> our<00:03:35.939> stay<00:03:36.389> in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
we're going to hook up our stay in

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.240 
we're going to hook up our stay in
charge<00:03:36.629> all<00:03:36.870> charge<00:03:37.170> cable<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.859> number<00:03:38.069> one

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
charge all charge cable to number one

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.220 
charge all charge cable to number one
and<00:03:38.519> then<00:03:38.730> we'll<00:03:38.879> go<00:03:39.030> over<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.659> we'll<00:03:40.049> do

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and then we'll go over and we'll do

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.259
