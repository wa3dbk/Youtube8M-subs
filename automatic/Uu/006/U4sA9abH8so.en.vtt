by 2 rotating plate place it along the
edge<00:00:45.710> here<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:47.120> we're<00:00:47.930> going<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.080> film<00:00:48.350> this

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
edge here and we're going to film this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.750 
edge here and we're going to film this
little<00:00:48.680> void<00:00:48.920> here<00:00:49.370> by<00:00:49.820> using<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.270> 1<00:00:50.450> by<00:00:50.600> 2<00:00:50.660> plate

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.200 

next<00:00:56.110> just<00:00:57.110> going<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.379> use<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:58.150> 2<00:00:59.150> by<00:00:59.180> 2<00:00:59.390> tile

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
next just going to use a 2 by 2 tile

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.760 
next just going to use a 2 by 2 tile
place<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.390> here<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.370> finally<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.720> 1<00:01:05.720> by<00:01:05.900> 2<00:01:08.770> now

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
place it here and finally a 1 by 2 now

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.580 
place it here and finally a 1 by 2 now
I'm<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.220> make<00:01:10.370> another<00:01:10.640> step<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.380> same

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
I'm going to make another step the same

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.450 
I'm going to make another step the same
way<00:01:12.830> as<00:01:12.979> before<00:01:16.479> but<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.690> time<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:19.280> going

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
way as before but this time just going

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.940 
way as before but this time just going
to<00:01:19.520> come<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:19.940> here<00:01:20.620> then<00:01:21.620> I'm<00:01:21.710> going<00:01:21.920> to

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
to come in here then I'm going to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.219 
to come in here then I'm going to
alternate<00:01:22.549> my<00:01:22.700> tiles<00:01:23.120> now<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.020> make<00:01:24.200> it

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
alternate my tiles now just to make it

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.090 
alternate my tiles now just to make it
look<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.560> like<00:01:25.100> brick<00:01:26.830> let's<00:01:27.830> start

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
look more like brick let's start

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.010 
look more like brick let's start
assembling<00:01:28.220> steps<00:01:34.570> I'm<00:01:35.570> going<00:01:35.719> to<00:01:35.780> need<00:01:35.899> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
assembling steps I'm going to need to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.709 
assembling steps I'm going to need to
make<00:01:36.229> eight<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.039> these<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.610> total<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:44.600> is

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
make eight of these in total this is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:02:05.529 
make eight of these in total this is
going<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.960> be<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.049> very<00:01:45.320> fun<00:01:46.009> project<00:01:46.250> very<00:01:46.880> easy

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:21.759 

so<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.880> keep<00:02:09.149> continuing<00:02:09.420> along<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:13.400> five

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.210 

long<00:02:22.769> as<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.040> keep<00:02:23.280> them<00:02:23.400> alternating<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:26.130> know

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
long as I keep them alternating you know

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.650 
long as I keep them alternating you know
you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.519> do<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.730> any<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.060> wanting<00:02:27.510> put

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you can do this any way you wanting put

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.449 
you can do this any way you wanting put
any<00:02:27.810> color<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
any color you want on here this is just

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.290 
any color you want on here this is just
for<00:02:29.640> demonstration<00:02:30.360> purposes<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:33.000> see

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
for demonstration purposes you can see

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:50.509 
for demonstration purposes you can see
everything's<00:02:33.810> pretty<00:02:34.019> alternating<00:02:49.519> some

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
everything's pretty alternating some

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.370 
everything's pretty alternating some
always<00:02:50.790> ask<00:02:51.000> me<00:02:51.180> why<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.569> work<00:02:51.780> fast

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
always ask me why do I work fast

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.930 
always ask me why do I work fast
because<00:02:53.190> I've<00:02:53.370> done<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.090> several<00:02:54.569> times

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
because I've done this several times

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:08.640 
because I've done this several times
okay<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.750> our<00:02:57.870> last<00:02:58.140> step

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.699 

and<00:03:09.650> there<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:10.040> our<00:03:10.189> 8<00:03:11.030> steps<00:03:14.319> now<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.349> want<00:03:15.680> to

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
and there is our 8 steps now I want to

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.940 
and there is our 8 steps now I want to
make<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.920> top<00:03:16.909> step<00:03:17.239> for<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.530> connect<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.920> a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
make a top step for to connect to a

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.819 
make a top step for to connect to a
second<00:03:19.400> floor<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:20.840> using<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.260> rotating

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
second floor so they using a rotating

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.160 
second floor so they using a rotating
plate<00:03:22.250> I'm<00:03:22.400> going<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.640> use<00:03:22.879> just<00:03:22.909> a<00:03:23.329> 2<00:03:23.900> by<00:03:24.140> 2

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
plate I'm going to use just a 2 by 2

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.210 
plate I'm going to use just a 2 by 2
black<00:03:25.159> plate<00:03:25.519> stick<00:03:25.909> it<00:03:26.030> here<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:29.540> 1<00:03:29.720> by<00:03:29.870> 2<00:03:30.220> and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
black plate stick it here and 1 by 2 and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.849 
black plate stick it here and 1 by 2 and
to<00:03:32.030> keep<00:03:32.209> everything<00:03:32.510> alternating<00:03:35.859> there's

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
to keep everything alternating there's

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.729 
to keep everything alternating there's
our<00:03:37.239> top<00:03:38.239> step<00:03:40.989> there's<00:03:41.989> two<00:03:42.170> different<00:03:42.530> types

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
our top step there's two different types

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.250 
our top step there's two different types
of<00:03:42.950> spiral<00:03:43.310> staircases<00:03:44.260> counterclockwise

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
of spiral staircases counterclockwise

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.319 
of spiral staircases counterclockwise
and<00:03:45.829> clockwise<00:03:46.329> I'm<00:03:47.329> going<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:47.629> build<00:03:47.810> mine

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
and clockwise I'm going to build mine

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.890 
and clockwise I'm going to build mine
counterclockwise<00:03:50.829> so<00:03:52.299> I'm<00:03:53.299> going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.540> come<00:03:53.750> in

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
counterclockwise so I'm going to come in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.129 
counterclockwise so I'm going to come in
here<00:03:54.170> take<00:03:54.950> one<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.689> steps<00:03:56.689> I'm<00:03:56.930> just

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
here take one of the steps I'm just

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.050 
here take one of the steps I'm just
gonna<00:03:59.139> place<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.170> on<00:04:00.439> my<00:04:00.760> plate<00:04:01.760> doesn't

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
gonna place it on my plate doesn't

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.360 
gonna place it on my plate doesn't
matter<00:04:02.329> where<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.629> goes<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.189> have

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
matter where it goes so we have

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.819 
matter where it goes so we have
something<00:04:04.939> that's<00:04:05.120> on<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.439> set<00:04:06.439> our<00:04:06.560> first

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
something that's on the set our first

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.280 
something that's on the set our first
step<00:04:07.239> now<00:04:08.239> take<00:04:08.569> our<00:04:08.750> step<00:04:08.989> we're<00:04:09.139> going<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
step now take our step we're going to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.830 
step now take our step we're going to
flip<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.650> over<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.159> I'm<00:04:10.939> going<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.180> stick<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.599> 1

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
flip it over and I'm going to stick a 1

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.810 
flip it over and I'm going to stick a 1
by<00:04:12.049> 1<00:04:12.079> stud<00:04:14.500> right<00:04:15.500> here<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:19.549> we're<00:04:19.669> going<00:04:19.789> to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
by 1 stud right here and we're going to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.580 
by 1 stud right here and we're going to
need<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.030> make<00:04:20.150> several<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.690> these<00:04:20.870> start

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
need to make several of these start

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.980 
need to make several of these start
flipping<00:04:22.039> these<00:04:22.160> over<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:26.360> is<00:04:26.570> going<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.810> be

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
flipping these over this is going to be

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.950 
flipping these over this is going to be
for<00:04:27.349> our<00:04:27.380> counterclockwise<00:04:28.360> clockwise<00:04:29.360> can

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
for our counterclockwise clockwise can

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:53.100 
for our counterclockwise clockwise can
be<00:04:30.050> built<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.380> same<00:04:30.590> way

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.010 

now<00:04:54.110> for<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.590> last<00:04:54.770> two<00:04:55.009> steps<00:04:55.539> I'm<00:04:56.539> going<00:04:56.930> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
now for the last two steps I'm going to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.499 
now for the last two steps I'm going to
place<00:04:57.259> the<00:04:57.650> stud<00:04:58.370> right<00:04:58.610> here<00:04:58.939> at<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.210> corner

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
place the stud right here at this corner

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.429 
place the stud right here at this corner
here<00:05:00.520> keep<00:05:01.520> everything<00:05:01.849> evenly<00:05:02.479> lined<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.289> and

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
here keep everything evenly lined up and

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.600 
here keep everything evenly lined up and
I'll<00:05:03.500> show<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.770> here<00:05:03.889> in<00:05:03.949> a<00:05:04.069> second<00:05:06.520> where<00:05:07.520> we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
I'll show you here in a second where we

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.290 
I'll show you here in a second where we
have<00:05:07.789> it<00:05:08.800> okay<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:09.860> now<00:05:10.340> let's<00:05:10.610> assemble<00:05:10.969> our

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
have it okay so now let's assemble our

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.740 
have it okay so now let's assemble our
spiral<00:05:12.050> staircase<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:14.210> going<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.539> take

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
spiral staircase just going to take

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
spiral staircase just going to take
these<00:05:14.960> steps<00:05:15.289> we're<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.770> going<00:05:15.979> to<00:05:16.039> start

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
these steps we're just going to start

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.899 
these steps we're just going to start
setting<00:05:16.669> them<00:05:16.759> on<00:05:16.879> these<00:05:19.060> rotating<00:05:20.060> plates

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
setting them on these rotating plates

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.610 
setting them on these rotating plates
sometimes<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:23.000> have<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.419> play<00:05:24.110> around<00:05:24.439> with

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
sometimes you have to play around with

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.499 
sometimes you have to play around with
it<00:05:24.889> to<00:05:26.409> get<00:05:27.409> it<00:05:27.500> lined<00:05:27.680> up<00:05:27.949> but<00:05:28.879> as<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.150> can<00:05:29.300> see

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
it to get it lined up but as you can see

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.929 
it to get it lined up but as you can see
the<00:05:29.719> studs<00:05:30.710> here<00:05:30.979> prevent<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> steps<00:05:31.759> from

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:31.939 
the studs here prevent the steps from

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:39.249 
the studs here prevent the steps from
folding<00:05:32.479> under<00:05:36.789> just<00:05:37.789> keep<00:05:38.090> adding<00:05:38.870> one

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
folding under just keep adding one

00:05:39.259 --> 00:06:08.709 
folding under just keep adding one
layers<00:05:49.000> very<00:05:50.000> easy<00:05:50.419> process

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:14.540 

and<00:06:09.719> there<00:06:10.349> we<00:06:10.499> have<00:06:10.679> it<00:06:10.860> a<00:06:12.770> complete<00:06:13.770> spiral

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
and there we have it a complete spiral

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.209 
and there we have it a complete spiral
staircase<00:06:15.089> now<00:06:16.050> this<00:06:16.349> thing<00:06:16.619> will<00:06:16.860> spread

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
staircase now this thing will spread

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.159 
staircase now this thing will spread
apart<00:06:17.550> like<00:06:17.729> this<00:06:18.029> but<00:06:18.509> if<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.110> look<00:06:19.139> on<00:06:19.529> top

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
apart like this but if you look on top

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.760 
apart like this but if you look on top
it's<00:06:22.169> pretty<00:06:22.729> it's<00:06:23.729> straight<00:06:24.499> so<00:06:25.499> when<00:06:25.679> we

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
it's pretty it's straight so when we

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.989 
it's pretty it's straight so when we
come<00:06:25.979> in<00:06:26.129> and<00:06:26.279> touch<00:06:26.399> our<00:06:26.669> floor<00:06:26.909> you<00:06:26.969> just

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 
come in and touch our floor you just

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.429 
come in and touch our floor you just
catch<00:06:27.330> it<00:06:27.509> up<00:06:27.629> to<00:06:27.749> here<00:06:28.110> and<00:06:28.939> you<00:06:30.110> can<00:06:31.110> see<00:06:31.259> the

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
catch it up to here and you can see the

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.119 
catch it up to here and you can see the
construction<00:06:32.279> here<00:06:32.819> is<00:06:33.059> very<00:06:33.809> simple<00:06:34.319> just<00:06:34.919> by

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
construction here is very simple just by

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:39.769 
construction here is very simple just by
using<00:06:35.309> the<00:06:35.520> revolving<00:06:36.199> plates<00:06:37.199> and<00:06:38.779> 2x4

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
using the revolving plates and 2x4

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:40.339 
using the revolving plates and 2x4
plates

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
plates

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.820 
plates
