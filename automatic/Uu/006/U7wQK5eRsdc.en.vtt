 and what we are going to do here 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 let's go placing a martini glass 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.529
 our elders 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.269
 lomaña had them but without the lemon of August I will not add the lemon 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.779
 not only was it used to make 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.779
 cooking in this case 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 small added that loves 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.909
 because the game is now that there is here 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.349
 I was adding him now the priest is the ere who also had a little 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.020
 orange 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.320
 as in what is missing cendoya 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.750
 to add squares 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 of the liquor jelly 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.840
 and I will also inherit 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.300
 as a final element like a motorcycle that should magically 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 little of the leaves 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.370
 the crispy 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.930
 By the way Saleh has done 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.420
 mehr team 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
 15 according to a piece of paper not to act locally prudently that these people are 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.360
 they took out four legs of time, we were not going to as much money as one can 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.400
 imagine dust of haste 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 soybean a general will cost made 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 of the mop assolutamente mind all the elements of the silver you could 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.820
 eventually reads 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.760
 block quiroz points for example last objective is of the highest quality 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.840
 almost at the level of companies and their children will go and put you say some 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.990
 'foquita' there they lost a dish just so impressive closed 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 the Cantabrian 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.270

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.900
 this plate 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 we are getting this data 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.900

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.930
 terribly bitter with wine and in truth that things really get 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.000
 complicated 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
