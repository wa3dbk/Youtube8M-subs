00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.190
 this time we are going to check 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.820
 the brakes of a car the ballads or 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 brake pads let's take them out and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.740
 see how they are doing if they need change 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.220
 here in this video I'm going to show you what 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.599
 that we need the tool 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.039
 like here you can see the cat the crosshead 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.520
 and some tools that we're going to 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.280
 need to use this tool the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.370
 crosshead and loosen all the screws 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.949
 that do not come out anything else loosen the and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 then once it loosens two we're going to put 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.309
 the cat down here to raise it up and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:54.079
 more easily the tire comes out ears 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:58.390
 screws the threads the wheels and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.390
 put the cat and we have also put 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.250
 stop the author let's remove the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.800
 tire 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.410
 let's check the tire that wear 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.250
 it's a normal wear if it was more 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.870
 spent here or this one will need a 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.030
 an alignment and balancing in any case 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.070
 let's bail the disk 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.070
 disc must be smooth 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.440
 it looks a bit streaked but it's ready 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.880
 still no not required to do the 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.430
 change 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.300
 next step we will remove the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.280
 screws 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.280
 these two screws is one up here 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.920
 down here you can not see here is the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.710
 other 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.710
 studies 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.710
 also this is what a valve 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.450
 that we open it when when 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.720
 we think the piston around here is going to come out 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 the brake fluid is just a 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.880
 trickle is the most spent 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 imagine that they have never changed the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.590
 brake fluid then all all the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.790
 partners stays there and if we listen to it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 well without purging all that waste 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.450
 they're going to give the hoses system 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 they can cover something especially if it's a bs 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.850
 your vehicle in this case this is not a bs 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.850
 we are not going to have to purge what 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.560
 we are removing what is being the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.950
 screws 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.060
 converse 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.060
 that we have loosened 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.489
 we'll see 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.190
 nothing 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.790
 what I do I always keep the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.950
 big the one on top on one side and the one on 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 down is always smaller but I 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.660
 always separated it to not confuse 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.620
 then we have it resolved 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 let's push it 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.840
 Noel 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.290
 can see here is also the piston that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.290
 I was saying 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.280
 this in the corridors 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.900
 let's see how they are 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.849
 they are still good live as they can 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.849
 watch 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.120
 they are still good they do not require the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.099
 change but in a case that already 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.290
 require nothing else is the same 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.080
 procedure nothing more new the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.650
 put and put back together put everything 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.640
 tire 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.259
 do not forget to press the brake about 10 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.889
 times for the brake fluid 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.889
 back down 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.460
 so that the piston in its in place that 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.660
 must go instead 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.660
 just as I was 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.930
 I usually forgot to luke 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.690
 when the change is already required 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.050
 all ballads are pills have 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.050
 is 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.550
 as half of this tells us start 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.590
 says one squeak something tells us that already 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.210
 you need the change to avoid scratching the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.060
 disk and make it a higher cost 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.389
 the brake pads or pads 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.069
 include calls let's do the 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.740
 piston back here you can see it 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.950
 well this piston has to be done by 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.050
 behind 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.370
 for that we have a tool some 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.500
 they are like these some are different 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.680
 what we are going to do is nothing more with the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.680
 yes 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.390
 and it started 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.790
 what has been going around like that 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.490
 we are not going to spin this this is going to 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.140
 go up and it's going to start 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.140
 lower the piston down 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.590
 see the piston is going down 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.940
 let's go back 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940
 will steal 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.419
 yes 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.670
 with down nothing more to reassemble 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.670
 the whole piece as it was 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.040
 let's go to a sant blog 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.250
 and here 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.970
 once the piston down so that 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.770
 can enter and the ballads that 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.979
 exactly in its place 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.180
 once it has put again we are going 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:31.590
 you have to put the screws in place 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.509
 tighten if you know to what 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.400
 specifications is much better me what 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.789
 what I do is nothing but what squeezes not very 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.630
 strong or very weak the screws if 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:46.770
 they're tight all right there's only 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.770
 to check that everything is fine 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:53.800
 As I told you, you have to step on the brake 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.280
 about ten times until again the 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.900
 piston fits what must go and 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.390
 the volatas are good and good 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.720
 tight because you can see this well 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.890
 as the piston is behind it is not 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.370
 tight not yet then you have to 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.170
 step on it and everything is fine and it would be all 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.340
 for today nothing more must be put to 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.560
 back the rim 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.490
 and then thanks for watching my videos that 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.590
 please subscribe we will continue uploading 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.590
 more videos like this until later
