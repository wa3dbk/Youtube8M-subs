regular Pentecostal what is the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.650 
regular Pentecostal what is the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
difference because sometimes people ask

me<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> question<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.470> said<00:00:19.529> what's<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
me a question they said what's the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.070 
me a question they said what's the
difference<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> Pentecostal<00:00:21.300> organs<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
difference in a Pentecostal organs and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
difference in a Pentecostal organs and
Church<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.740> God<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.039> Christ<00:00:23.160> organs<00:00:23.930> well<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Church of God in Christ organs well I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.519 
Church of God in Christ organs well I
think<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> our<00:00:26.010> changes<00:00:27.529> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
think it's just some of our changes the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.590 
think it's just some of our changes the
way<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:29.269> pull<00:00:30.269> our<00:00:30.480> cords<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.330 

this<00:00:36.600> turkey<00:00:37.079> God<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.350> Christ<00:00:37.530> they're<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
this turkey God in Christ they're the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
this turkey God in Christ they're the
full<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:42.090> hand<00:00:42.360> chords<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
full two hand chords I think is the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:56.520 
full two hand chords I think is the
difference<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> differences

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.930 

that's<00:00:57.530> one<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.980> changes<00:00:58.220> I<00:00:58.550> mean<00:00:58.700> then

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
that's one of the changes I mean then

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.939 
that's one of the changes I mean then
you<00:00:58.970> can't<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.790> have<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.149> acknowledge<00:01:02.270> a

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you can't you have to acknowledge a

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.000 
you can't you have to acknowledge a
twinkie<00:01:03.949> Clark<00:01:04.250> because<00:01:04.670> she<00:01:05.770> was<00:01:06.770> very

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
twinkie Clark because she was very

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.880 
twinkie Clark because she was very
instrumental<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.790> molding<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:09.140> sound<00:01:09.560> that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
instrumental and molding that sound that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.830 
instrumental and molding that sound that
sound<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.580> putting<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.970> out<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.780> know

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
sound and putting it out there you know

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.910 
sound and putting it out there you know
yeah<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.869> but<00:01:14.869> most<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.290> most<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
yeah and but most of most of the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.999 
yeah and but most of most of the
organist<00:01:16.430> they<00:01:17.270> picked<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.200> style<00:01:18.710> and

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
organist they picked up that style and

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.520 
organist they picked up that style and
there's<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.729> certain<00:01:19.970> tone<00:01:20.899> that<00:01:21.200> they<00:01:21.320> look

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
there's a certain tone that they look

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.950 
there's a certain tone that they look
for<00:01:21.830> in<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.310> think<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:23.119> what<00:01:23.420> most<00:01:23.780> of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
for in this I think it's what most of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.560 
for in this I think it's what most of
the<00:01:24.020> drawbar<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.530> all<00:01:24.860> out<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.509> said

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
the drawbar is all out and like I said

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.010 
the drawbar is all out and like I said
with<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.500> two<00:01:27.710> hand<00:01:27.950> chords<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:29.690> strong

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
with the two hand chords and the strong

00:01:30.020 --> 00:03:02.530 
with the two hand chords and the strong
base

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.710 

like<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:04.140> like<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.380> big<00:03:05.090> majestic<00:03:06.090> type<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
like it's like a big majestic type of a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.250 
like it's like a big majestic type of a
sound

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
sound
