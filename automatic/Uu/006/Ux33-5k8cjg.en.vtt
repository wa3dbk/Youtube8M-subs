it's<00:00:01.740> another<00:00:01.979> beautiful<00:00:02.280> day<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.580> Sydney<00:00:03.120> I'm

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
it's another beautiful day in Sydney I'm

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.869 
it's another beautiful day in Sydney I'm
out<00:00:04.049> enjoying<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> Sun<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.009> looking<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.700> find

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
out enjoying the Sun and looking to find

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.589 
out enjoying the Sun and looking to find
out<00:00:06.029> if<00:00:06.150> anyone<00:00:06.480> knows<00:00:06.690> why<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.560> Sun<00:00:07.950> shines

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
out if anyone knows why the Sun shines

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.190 
out if anyone knows why the Sun shines
so<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> Sun<00:00:09.960> gives<00:00:10.620> us<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.860> lot<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> hate

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
so the Sun gives us a lot of hate

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.169 
so the Sun gives us a lot of hate
sunshine<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.830> divides<00:00:14.099> energy<00:00:14.580> yeah<00:00:14.969> he

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
sunshine the divides energy yeah he

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
sunshine the divides energy yeah he
doesn't<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.630> really<00:00:16.049> where<00:00:16.350> does<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.770> Sun

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
doesn't like really where does the Sun

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.740 
doesn't like really where does the Sun
get<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> energy<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:19.820> no<00:00:20.820> idea<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.720> no

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
get that energy from I no idea I have no

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.679 
get that energy from I no idea I have no
idea<00:00:22.130> some<00:00:23.130> kind<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.519> chemical<00:00:23.910> reaction

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
idea some kind of chemical reaction

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.319 
idea some kind of chemical reaction
yeah<00:00:27.689> gas<00:00:28.019> explosions<00:00:28.679> doesn't<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> burn<00:00:29.970> gas

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
yeah gas explosions doesn't it burn gas

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.680 
yeah gas explosions doesn't it burn gas
the<00:00:30.960> burning<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.289> gases<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:32.309> burning<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.210> for

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the burning of gases it's burning up for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.930 
the burning of gases it's burning up for
the<00:00:34.500> fire<00:00:34.769> that's<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> Sun

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.060 

but<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.300> Sun<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:43.079> giant<00:00:43.680> ball<00:00:43.830> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but is the Sun really a giant ball of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000 
but is the Sun really a giant ball of
fire<00:00:44.310> I<00:00:44.640> mean<00:00:45.000> wouldn't<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.470> after

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
fire I mean wouldn't it go out after

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
fire I mean wouldn't it go out after
five<00:00:47.190> billion<00:00:47.520> years<00:00:47.880> one<00:00:48.630> of<00:00:48.660> those<00:00:48.870> things

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
five billion years one of those things

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720 
five billion years one of those things
that<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.470> just<00:00:49.920> assume<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.610> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that you just assume you know but then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.920 
that you just assume you know but then
you<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:50.970> actually<00:00:51.180> know

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you don't actually know

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080 
you don't actually know
so<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.530> bucket<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.040> have<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> components

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so in this bucket I have the components

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.090 
so in this bucket I have the components
of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> Sun<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.650> have<00:00:56.269> protons<00:00:57.269> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
of the Sun well I have protons and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
of the Sun well I have protons and
neutrons<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.790> some<00:00:59.940> electrons<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
neutrons there are some electrons but I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
neutrons there are some electrons but I
didn't<00:01:00.989> bring<00:01:01.080> them<00:01:01.230> okay

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
didn't bring them okay

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
didn't bring them okay
most<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.449> Sun<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.220> protons<00:01:05.220> okay

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
most the Sun is actually protons okay

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
most the Sun is actually protons okay
and<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.660> are<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> protons<00:01:07.110> doing<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and so what are the protons doing the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
and so what are the protons doing the
Sun<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.390> dance<00:01:09.840> together<00:01:13.190> okay

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
Sun it dance together okay

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
Sun it dance together okay
okay<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:15.990> come<00:01:16.200> close<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.040> what

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
okay when they come close you know what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
okay when they come close you know what
they<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.300> flat<00:01:18.539> well<00:01:19.110> actually

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
they do they just flat well actually

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
they do they just flat well actually
they<00:01:19.470> bounce<00:01:19.920> off<00:01:20.130> each<00:01:20.160> other<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.789> coming<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they bounce off each other I'm coming in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.160 
they bounce off each other I'm coming in
oh<00:01:23.180> why<00:01:24.180> did<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> protons<00:01:24.750> bounce<00:01:24.930> off<00:01:25.140> each

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
oh why did the protons bounce off each

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.900 
oh why did the protons bounce off each
other<00:01:25.470> sometimes<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.220> electrons

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
other sometimes with electrons

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.510 
other sometimes with electrons
how's<00:01:27.570> new<00:01:27.780> native<00:01:28.170> oh<00:01:28.259> yeah<00:01:28.619> cuz<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.340> don't

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
how's new native oh yeah cuz it don't

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.830 
how's new native oh yeah cuz it don't
like<00:01:29.670> each<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.539> like<00:01:30.810> each

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
like each other they don't like each

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.340 
like each other they don't like each
other<00:01:31.550> that's<00:01:32.550> because<00:01:32.910> a<00:01:33.210> proton<00:01:33.930> needs<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
other that's because a proton needs a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
other that's because a proton needs a
neutron<00:01:34.830> right<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.550> why<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.970> they

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
neutron right you know why they they

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
neutron right you know why they they
repel<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.410> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
repel like that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.830 
repel like that
magnetic<00:01:39.180> force<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.590> repelling<00:01:41.190> magnet<00:01:41.910> type

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
magnetic force the repelling magnet type

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
magnetic force the repelling magnet type
thing<00:01:43.140> Megan<00:01:43.680> silver<00:01:44.130> electric<00:01:45.000> field

positive<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> negative<00:01:46.350> positive<00:01:46.650> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
positive and negative positive and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.680 
positive and negative positive and
negative<00:01:47.400> it's<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> positive

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
negative it's to do with the positive

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.540 
negative it's to do with the positive
negative<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.680> protons<00:01:50.130> protons

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
negative right we got protons protons

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.080 
negative right we got protons protons
are<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> positively<00:01:53.100> charged<00:01:53.400> yes<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
are the positively charged yes the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
are the positively charged yes the
positive<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.600> probably<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:54.990> okay<00:01:55.440> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
positive you're probably good okay this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.230 
positive you're probably good okay this
is<00:01:56.220> why<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.550> important<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.030> sun's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is why it's so important that the sun's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760 
is why it's so important that the sun's
hot<00:01:57.450> because<00:01:57.690> if<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> Sun<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.200> hot<00:01:58.350> enough<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hot because if the Sun is hot enough it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
hot because if the Sun is hot enough it
gets<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.280> things<00:01:59.610> moving<00:01:59.910> so<00:02:00.120> fast<00:02:00.330> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
gets these things moving so fast that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.120 
gets these things moving so fast that
sometimes<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.260> can't<00:02:01.530> avoid<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.800> collision

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
sometimes they can't avoid a collision

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.890 
sometimes they can't avoid a collision
okay<00:02:02.760> when<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.210> too<00:02:03.360> close<00:02:03.540> they

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
okay when they get too close they

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:22.350 
okay when they get too close they
actually<00:02:04.320> go

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.630 

smash<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.990> brothers<00:02:23.350> yeah<00:02:23.890> yeah<00:02:24.070> yeah<00:02:24.340> no<00:02:24.580> no

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
smash the brothers yeah yeah yeah no no

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.300 
smash the brothers yeah yeah yeah no no
dispatch<00:02:25.060> oh<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:26.920> they're<00:02:27.100> stuck

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
dispatch oh and now they're stuck

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280 
dispatch oh and now they're stuck
together<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.690> saw<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:28.990> happened<00:02:29.200> when

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
together and you saw what happened when

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.190 
together and you saw what happened when
they<00:02:29.380> smashed<00:02:29.650> together<00:02:30.210> what<00:02:31.210> happened<00:02:31.570> they

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
they smashed together what happened they

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.230 
they smashed together what happened they
leaked<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.020> synergy<00:02:35.410> yeah<00:02:36.100> see<00:02:36.730> well<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
leaked is that synergy yeah see well the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.420 
leaked is that synergy yeah see well the
water<00:02:37.420> pulled<00:02:37.750> out<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.380> guess<00:02:39.040> energy

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
water pulled out but I guess energy

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.490 
water pulled out but I guess energy
would<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.610> poured<00:02:39.820> out<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.570> energy<00:02:41.170> in

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
would have poured out it the energy in

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380 
would have poured out it the energy in
the<00:02:41.590> channel<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.250> energy<00:02:42.280> came<00:02:42.730> out<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.270> was

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the channel the energy came out what was

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.830 
the channel the energy came out what was
the<00:02:43.480> energy<00:02:43.780> before<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.290> energy<00:02:44.700> kinetic

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the energy before it was energy kinetic

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.470 
the energy before it was energy kinetic
thought<00:02:46.840> energy<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> what's<00:02:48.880> happening<00:02:49.270> there

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
thought energy so what's happening there

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.020 
thought energy so what's happening there
it's<00:02:49.900> releasing<00:02:50.170> some<00:02:50.500> mass<00:02:51.070> yeah<00:02:51.880> yeah

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
it's releasing some mass yeah yeah

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.540 
it's releasing some mass yeah yeah
waiting<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.990> mass<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:54.130> kinetic

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
waiting and that mass is is kinetic

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.490 
waiting and that mass is is kinetic
energy

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
energy

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.230 
energy
it<00:02:56.500> was<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.800> mass<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.460> proton<00:03:00.240> proton

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
it was the mass of the proton proton

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.850 
it was the mass of the proton proton
smashed<00:03:01.810> together<00:03:02.020> they<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.410> lighter

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
smashed together they got lighter

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.920 
smashed together they got lighter
yeah<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.820> they<00:03:03.880> lost<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.360> mass<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.870> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
yeah and they lost that mass and the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.150 
yeah and they lost that mass and the
mass<00:03:04.960> was<00:03:05.290> converted<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.650> energy<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:06.070> know

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
mass was converted to energy you know

what's<00:03:34.570> he<00:03:34.870> means<00:03:35.170> sir<00:03:35.530> C<00:03:35.830> is<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.840> speed<00:03:38.050> of

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
what's he means sir C is the speed of

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.850 
what's he means sir C is the speed of
light<00:03:38.310> speed<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.430> light<00:03:39.610> no<00:03:39.850> right<00:03:40.620> Billy

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
light speed of light no right Billy

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.910 
light speed of light no right Billy
yeah<00:03:42.040> huh<00:03:42.610> isn't<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.570> weird<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.620> speed<00:03:44.830> of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
yeah huh isn't that weird the speed of

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.840 
yeah huh isn't that weird the speed of
light<00:03:45.100> right<00:03:45.550> huh<00:03:46.709> well<00:03:47.709> now<00:03:48.280> why<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.459> we<00:03:48.550> have

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
light right huh well now why do we have

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.060 
light right huh well now why do we have
sides<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.750> seems<00:03:50.050> most<00:03:50.290> people<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> tough

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
sides it seems most people have a tough

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.040 
sides it seems most people have a tough
time<00:03:51.250> remembering<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.880> C<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.450> for<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> speed

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
time remembering that C is for the speed

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.290 
time remembering that C is for the speed
of<00:03:53.140> light<00:03:53.380> maybe<00:03:54.040> that's<00:03:54.190> because<00:03:54.280> C<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> bit

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
of light maybe that's because C is a bit

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.090 
of light maybe that's because C is a bit
of<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.420> strange<00:03:55.780> letter<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.320> represent<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.800> speed

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
of a strange letter to represent a speed

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640 
of a strange letter to represent a speed
in<00:03:57.310> fact<00:03:57.910> an<00:03:58.030> Einstein's<00:03:58.540> original<00:03:58.959> paper<00:03:59.170> he

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
in fact an Einstein's original paper he

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.830 
in fact an Einstein's original paper he
used<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.980> letter<00:04:00.160> V<00:04:00.489> for<00:04:00.970> velocity<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.660> light

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
used the letter V for velocity of light

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.260 
used the letter V for velocity of light
but<00:04:02.560> nowadays<00:04:02.739> everyone<00:04:03.370> uses<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.790> letter<00:04:03.970> C

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
but nowadays everyone uses the letter C

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.479 
but nowadays everyone uses the letter C
for<00:04:04.540> constant<00:04:05.320> it's<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:05.890> constant<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.400> the

the energy combined together creates the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.499 
the energy combined together creates the
energy<00:04:28.379> he's<00:04:29.379> basically<00:04:29.860> saying<00:04:30.250> like<00:04:30.879> this

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
energy he's basically saying like this

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.290 
energy he's basically saying like this
mass<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.349> comes<00:04:32.590> out<00:04:32.800> gets<00:04:33.759> converted<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.270> a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
mass that comes out gets converted to a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.089 
mass that comes out gets converted to a
lot<00:04:34.599> of<00:04:34.629> energy<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:35.439> the<00:04:35.590> speed<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.889> light<00:04:35.979> is

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
lot of energy and the speed of light is

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:36.869 
lot of energy and the speed of light is
a<00:04:36.129> huge<00:04:36.460> number

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
a huge number

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.760 
a huge number
yeah<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.629> think<00:04:37.719> about<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.110> tiny<00:04:38.469> bit<00:04:38.680> of

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
yeah you think about that tiny bit of

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.909 
yeah you think about that tiny bit of
mass<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:39.939> a<00:04:40.000> huge<00:04:40.449> amount<00:04:40.659> of<00:04:40.780> energy<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.500> every

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
mass is a huge amount of energy so every

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.040 
mass is a huge amount of energy so every
second<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.370> Sun<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.699> actually<00:04:42.849> losing<00:04:43.150> 4.3

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
second the Sun is actually losing 4.3

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.240 
second the Sun is actually losing 4.3
billion<00:04:44.889> kilograms<00:04:46.110> every<00:04:47.110> second<00:04:47.469> that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
billion kilograms every second that

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.920 
billion kilograms every second that
amount<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.580> mass<00:04:48.789> is<00:04:49.090> being<00:04:49.360> converted<00:04:49.629> into

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
amount of mass is being converted into

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.790 
amount of mass is being converted into
energy<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:52.000> Sun<00:04:52.270> hydrogen<00:04:53.110> fuses

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
energy in the Sun hydrogen fuses

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.890 
energy in the Sun hydrogen fuses
together<00:04:54.129> to<00:04:54.310> form<00:04:54.520> helium<00:04:54.629> but<00:04:55.629> that's<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
together to form helium but that's a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.379 
together to form helium but that's a
little<00:04:56.050> confusing<00:04:56.529> because<00:04:56.800> how<00:04:57.639> out<00:04:57.939> of<00:04:58.090> only

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
little confusing because how out of only

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.110 
little confusing because how out of only
protons<00:04:58.930> do<00:04:59.469> we<00:04:59.590> create<00:04:59.830> a<00:05:00.129> helium<00:05:00.729> nucleus

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
protons do we create a helium nucleus

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.809 
protons do we create a helium nucleus
which<00:05:01.330> has<00:05:01.360> two<00:05:01.779> protons<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.379> two<00:05:02.620> neutrons

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
which has two protons and two neutrons

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.490 
which has two protons and two neutrons
well<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:03.909> thing<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.120> when<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> first<00:05:05.169> two

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
well the thing is when the first two

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.450 
well the thing is when the first two
smashed<00:05:06.189> together<00:05:07.680> one<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.039> protons

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
smashed together one of the protons

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.369 
smashed together one of the protons
actually<00:05:09.879> emits<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.449> positron<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.349> neutrino

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
actually emits a positron and a neutrino

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.929 
actually emits a positron and a neutrino
it<00:05:12.039> quickly<00:05:12.370> becomes<00:05:12.909> a<00:05:13.900> neutron<00:05:14.819> next<00:05:15.819> thing

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
it quickly becomes a neutron next thing

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.029 
it quickly becomes a neutron next thing
that<00:05:15.969> happens<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.509> another<00:05:16.990> proton<00:05:17.439> smashes

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
that happens is another proton smashes

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.559 
that happens is another proton smashes
in<00:05:18.219> and<00:05:18.960> again<00:05:19.960> we<00:05:20.110> get<00:05:20.229> more<00:05:20.529> energy<00:05:21.039> released

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
in and again we get more energy released

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.939 
in and again we get more energy released
now<00:05:22.569> if<00:05:22.719> two<00:05:23.020> particles<00:05:23.379> like<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:24.009> collide

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
now if two particles like this collide

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.249 
now if two particles like this collide
they<00:05:26.949> emit<00:05:27.310> two<00:05:27.699> protons<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.569> what<00:05:29.110> we're

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
they emit two protons and what we're

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.439 
they emit two protons and what we're
left<00:05:29.379> with<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:32.169> helium<00:05:32.620> four<00:05:32.979> nucleus

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
left with is the helium four nucleus

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.990 
left with is the helium four nucleus
there<00:05:34.449> you<00:05:34.750> have<00:05:35.039> hydrogen<00:05:36.039> fused<00:05:36.550> into

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
there you have hydrogen fused into

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.930 
there you have hydrogen fused into
helium<00:05:37.289> and<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.349> lot<00:05:38.529> of<00:05:38.620> mass<00:05:38.800> lost<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.490> lot<00:05:39.909> of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
helium and a lot of mass lost a lot of

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.309 
helium and a lot of mass lost a lot of
energy<00:05:40.210> released<00:05:41.639> yes<00:05:42.779> if<00:05:43.779> you<00:05:43.990> want<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.229> know

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.219 
this video by minutephysics it explains
how<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.610> protons<00:05:49.089> confuse<00:05:49.659> even<00:05:50.020> though

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
how the protons confuse even though

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.450 
how the protons confuse even though
they're<00:05:50.349> not<00:05:50.379> really<00:05:50.469> going<00:05:50.860> fast<00:05:51.159> enough<00:05:51.310> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
they're not really going fast enough to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.249 
they're not really going fast enough to
overcome<00:05:52.060> their<00:05:52.330> repulsion<00:05:52.659> hot<00:05:53.050> enough<00:05:53.199> for

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
overcome their repulsion hot enough for

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.829 
overcome their repulsion hot enough for
fusion<00:05:53.529> will<00:05:54.129> fuse<00:05:54.400> together<00:05:54.550> anyway<00:05:55.089> and<00:05:55.389> the

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
fusion will fuse together anyway and the

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.779 
fusion will fuse together anyway and the
Sun<00:05:55.990> is<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.379> big<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.650> has<00:05:56.919> so<00:05:57.250> much<00:05:57.400> hydrogen

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
Sun is so big and has so much hydrogen

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.730 
Sun is so big and has so much hydrogen
that<00:05:58.300> these<00:05:58.509> small<00:05:58.779> chances<00:05:59.169> happen<00:05:59.469> all<00:05:59.710> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
that these small chances happen all the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.889 
that these small chances happen all the
time
