00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.480 
the first chapter in it but I cannot
wait<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> get<00:04:25.230> through<00:04:25.440> them<00:04:25.590> now<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.370> next

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
wait to get through them now the next

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.920 
wait to get through them now the next
thing<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.820> picked<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.120> was<00:04:27.180> also<00:04:27.540> on<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> whim

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
thing I picked up was also on a whim

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.450 
thing I picked up was also on a whim
I've<00:04:28.170> heard<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.620> couple<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:29.010> good<00:04:29.160> things<00:04:29.340> about

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
I've heard a couple of good things about

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.490 
I've heard a couple of good things about
it<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.880> believe<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.420> anime<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.140> getting

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
it and I believe the anime is getting

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.440 
it and I believe the anime is getting
started<00:04:31.770> tune<00:04:32.130> or<00:04:32.400> it's<00:04:32.550> restarting<00:04:33.270> again

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
started tune or it's restarting again

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.780 
started tune or it's restarting again
soon<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.500> think<00:04:34.590> they've<00:04:34.830> just<00:04:35.100> hit<00:04:35.340> 200

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
soon and I think they've just hit 200

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.610 
soon and I think they've just hit 200
chapters<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.510> pretty<00:04:36.990> much<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.290> short

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
chapters so it's pretty much a short

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.800 
chapters so it's pretty much a short
series<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.340> get<00:04:38.460> into<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.390> matching

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
series to get into and that is matching

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.870 
series to get into and that is matching
or<00:04:39.990> Magi<00:04:40.560> depending<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.160> how<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.490> want<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.760> put

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
or Magi depending on how you want to put

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.510 
or Magi depending on how you want to put
on<00:04:41.970> sit<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.840> basically<00:04:43.280> sort<00:04:44.280> of<00:04:44.400> a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
on sit and this is basically sort of a

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.700 
on sit and this is basically sort of a
different<00:04:45.030> telling<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.870> Aladdin<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.560> main

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
different telling of Aladdin the main

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.380

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
character is called Aladdin and it does

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.300 
character is called Aladdin and it does

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
if you're into that sort of thing i'd

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.090 
if you're into that sort of thing i'd

volume and just the way the story is
progressing<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.130> seems<00:04:56.340> very<00:04:56.550> interesting<00:04:57.240> to

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
progressing it seems very interesting to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.850 
progressing it seems very interesting to
give<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.660> quick<00:04:58.110> run<00:04:58.380> down<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.740> main

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
give a quick run down the main

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.680 
give a quick run down the main
characters<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.400> lad<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.730> he<00:04:59.910> has<00:05:00.120> magical

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
characters on lad in he has magical

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.330 
characters on lad in he has magical
flute<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.170> contains<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.710> genie<00:05:01.980> but<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
flute that contains a genie but the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.400 
flute that contains a genie but the
genie<00:05:02.550> can't<00:05:02.850> get<00:05:03.060> his<00:05:03.300> full<00:05:03.840> body<00:05:04.050> out<00:05:04.350> i

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
genie can't get his full body out i

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.590 
genie can't get his full body out i
believe<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.130> get<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.340> all<00:05:05.460> out<00:05:05.520> bars<00:05:06.000> head<00:05:06.330> so

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
believe and get it all out bars head so

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.990 
believe and get it all out bars head so
basically<00:05:07.200> Aladdin<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:08.040> searching<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.850> world

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
basically Aladdin is searching the world

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.410 
basically Aladdin is searching the world
for<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.230> it's<00:05:10.410> more<00:05:10.910> magical<00:05:11.910> items<00:05:12.240> that

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
for I think it's more magical items that

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.210 
for I think it's more magical items that
could<00:05:12.600> contain<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.200> rest<00:05:13.380> of<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.590> genie<00:05:13.800> so

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
could contain the rest of the genie so

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.100 
could contain the rest of the genie so
they're<00:05:14.460> traveling<00:05:15.240> around<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.630> world<00:05:15.690> going

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
they're traveling around the world going

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.930 
they're traveling around the world going
into<00:05:16.470> dungeons<00:05:16.920> which<00:05:17.160> are<00:05:17.310> these<00:05:17.400> mystical

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
into dungeons which are these mystical

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.850 
into dungeons which are these mystical
places<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:18.510> people<00:05:18.780> entered<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:19.560> never

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
places that people entered but never

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.470 
places that people entered but never
have<00:05:20.010> come<00:05:20.160> back<00:05:20.220> out<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.030> obviously<00:05:21.240> there's

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
have come back out so obviously there's

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.090 
have come back out so obviously there's
gonna<00:05:21.570> be<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> lot<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:22.020> mystery<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.620> lot<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.890> a
