steps on how to download Quincy kit are
the<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.910> we<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.120> now<00:01:18.240> covering<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.870> in

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the same so we are now covering them in

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.760 
the same so we are now covering them in
this<00:01:19.380> tutorial<00:01:20.750> once<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.050> are<00:01:22.170> downloaded

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this tutorial once they are downloaded

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
this tutorial once they are downloaded
simply<00:01:23.700> drag<00:01:23.970> both<00:01:24.240> folders<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.110> project

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
simply drag both folders to your project

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
simply drag both folders to your project
make<00:01:26.430> sure<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.940> enable<00:01:27.150> create<00:01:27.660> groups<00:01:28.050> for

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
make sure to enable create groups for

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.249 
make sure to enable create groups for
any<00:01:28.530> edit<00:01:28.860> folders<00:01:29.360> optionally<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:31.080> all

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
any edit folders optionally put all

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
any edit folders optionally put all
files<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.890> folder<00:01:32.040> named<00:01:32.610> vendor<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.690> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
files in the folder named vendor so you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
files in the folder named vendor so you
can<00:01:33.990> easier<00:01:34.350> differ<00:01:34.590> between<00:01:34.950> files<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
can easier differ between files you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.080 
can easier differ between files you
created<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> files<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.869> other<00:01:37.020> developers

created and files of other developers

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
created and files of other developers
now<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.150> need<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> create<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> new<00:01:39.960> preprocessor

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
now we need to create a new preprocessor

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800 
now we need to create a new preprocessor
