00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.140

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.450
 program starting this Saturday with 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
 joy and in the presence of God 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 This is very good because God is our 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 creator 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.520
 he is the one who created all this universe and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.640
 gave the Sabbath to each one of them 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.640
 We are waiting for you. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.039
 the story of today what a good thing and the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 people already have a hint of the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.510
 Today's story 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.059
 god is our creator 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 many theories say that man was not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.309
 created by god that he came from a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.280
 kind of an animal but believe in 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 god is our creator I'm doing 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 The right thing is true for you. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.379
 because the bible says so enough 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.930
 people believe and have faith that he 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 keep and take care of each one of us god 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.329
 that teaching wonderful universe I 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 I have here with me a globe 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.199
 and here we can see the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 immensity of the universe the immensity of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.290
 the planet earth that for us people 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 is so much water that God created parts with 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 earth where we inhabit looks created the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.830
 plants that animals incra and I have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 Animal here to show you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.259
 I have two little animals that I have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.340
 dog or cat and both the little animals 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 God created many animals of sizes 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.070
 different functions with different functions 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.420
 live here on earth but when it arrived 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 man's hour in all changed figure 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 god created man differently 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 You know how God created man. 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.770
 he took the clay shaped a man and made 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.720
 cute clay doll 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.390
 the breath of life remains 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.990
 and then he became a soul 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.729
 a living being who breathes to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.240
 Praise the Lord too. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.210
 and god gave different ability to the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.220
 man different from the animal other 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.150
 functions that exist on the planet 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:29.620
 knows how god the women ability 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.530
 think of writing a book how much 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.840
 wonderful that we can read in a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.230
 book learn and grow 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.570
 intellectually actually gave the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.680
 ability for some 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.930
 local things to draw and paint 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.260
 Do you like to paint with a pen? 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.850
 It is and there are people with so much specialty 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.070
 to draw differently is not the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.540
 besides the pens we also have the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:06.489
 painters who make great works of art 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.610
 ordinary simple princial god is fantastic 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.090
 God gave man the ability to create 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.530
 different things different technologies 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.780
 and so giving us is also more skill 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.620
 in many things 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.830
 How much God thought of the man of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.400
 very differently in a very special way 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.049

 Thank God every day for everything 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.910
 that he gives us the air we breathe 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.299
 by the intelligence to think the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.810
 to meditate and think of the wonders of 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.330
 God, then, especially today one day in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.910
