again every time n everybody was walking
tour<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.619> loop<00:01:19.799> la<00:01:20.270> mulana<00:01:21.270> has<00:01:22.040> since<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.430> ages

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
tour a loop la mulana has since the ages

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
tour a loop la mulana has since the ages
it's<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's not going to be up for I want to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.370 
it's not going to be up for I want to
say<00:01:25.979> 30<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.400> seconds<00:01:26.810> maybe<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.200> rose

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

again
yeah<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.420> they'll<00:01:30.720> probably<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.170> now

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
yeah I think they'll probably for now

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.690 
yeah I think they'll probably for now
the<00:01:31.320> rush<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.010> bling<00:01:32.250> coming<00:01:32.550> again

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

the rush on here but bling coming again
brought<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.540> roots<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:33.930> involve<00:01:34.320> around

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
brought out roots will involve around

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
brought out roots will involve around
three<00:01:35.190> seconds<00:01:35.490> dunno<00:01:35.640> when<00:01:35.790> she<00:01:35.970> gets<00:01:36.150> rid<00:01:36.300> of

three seconds dunno when she gets rid of
hit<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.630> again<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.830> time<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> base

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
hit it again this time back to the base

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.719 
hit it again this time back to the base
and<00:01:39.860> mm<00:01:40.860> why<00:01:41.010> should<00:01:41.220> people<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.580> just

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and mm why should people get up just
