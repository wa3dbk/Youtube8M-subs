00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
by a paired developed at volume which

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:59.349 
by a paired developed at volume which
will<00:01:49.039> be<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.310> finally<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.209> last

thing<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.200> will<00:02:03.319> give<00:02:03.500> us<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.860> single<00:02:04.099> before

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
thing so it will give us a single before

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.899 
thing so it will give us a single before
the<00:02:04.789> paradiddle<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.020> we<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.590> right<00:02:07.520> left

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909
