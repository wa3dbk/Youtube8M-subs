00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.369
Au Gratin Potatoes are a satisfying
side dish of thinly sliced potatoes

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.000
topped with a crispy crust of brown
breadcrumbs, shredded cheese, and butter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.919
Add a protein like ham, and this side
dish easily becomes a hearty meal.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.449
Here's how to make this french dish
in four easy steps.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.019
Step One:
Slice the potatoes.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.970
For thick skins potatoes peel them first,
then slice into quarter-inch rounds.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.740
Step Two:
Assemble Topping.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.950
First, coat a baking dish with butter,
and spread a layer of sliced potatoes

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.420
in the bottom.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.930
Next sprinkle on salt, pepper and
shredded cheese.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.400
Continue to layer potatoes and
cheese until the pan is full.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.940
Step Three:
Add Liquid.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.080
Whisk together cream or milk, and season
with salt, pepper, and herbs.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.090
Add garlic for extra flavor.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.220
Pour the creamy liquid over the
potatoes. Fill the pan with enough

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.240
liquid to slightly cover the potatoes.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
Pop it in the oven and bake uncovered
for an hour.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.150
Or until the potatoes are tender.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.370
Step Four:
Brown the top.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.370
Remove the baking dish
to the stove top.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.720
Dot the top of the casserole with butter.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.480
Add shredded cheese, and sprinkle on
bread crumbs.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.040
Place under the boiler for a few
minutes and watch carefully

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.320
 so you don't burn the top.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.770
When the cheese is melted, and the bread
crumbs browned, remove to the stove top

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.770
and let cool for five minutes
before serving.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.640
Creamy, crisp, and delicious,
Au Gratin Potatoes just may become

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.150
your family's favorite way to make potatoes!
