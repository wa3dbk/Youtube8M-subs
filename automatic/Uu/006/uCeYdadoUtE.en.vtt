damaged<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.899> here<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.079> opening<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> box

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
damaged so here I'm opening up the box

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:45.459 
damaged so here I'm opening up the box
as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.980> is<00:00:37.980> micromax<00:00:39.500> a350<00:00:41.719> night

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.549 

okay<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.969> let's<00:00:47.969> open<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> package<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
okay so let's open the package the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
okay so let's open the package the
strange<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.910> box<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.390> still<00:00:51.570> black

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
strange because the box is still black

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
strange because the box is still black
but<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> says<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.129> white<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:55.050> assuming

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
but it says it's white so I was assuming

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.330 
but it says it's white so I was assuming
that<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.670> box<00:00:56.940> should<00:00:57.149> had<00:00:57.329> also<00:00:57.690> been<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that the box should had also been in a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.110 
that the box should had also been in a
white<00:00:59.520> color<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:01.129> let<00:01:02.129> me<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.489> quickly<00:01:02.609> open
