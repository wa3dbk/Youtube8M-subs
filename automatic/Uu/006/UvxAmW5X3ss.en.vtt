00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.330
 beautiful all the boys 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 welcome back to this new video of b 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 clans are the boss between me and today we are 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 in a different video than usual because 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.100
 we are in a tutorial 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.920
 well this tutorial will talk about how 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.189
 expand your memory 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.560
 playstation 3 slim with a memory of 12 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.210
 gigabyte 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 the method is really simple 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 since it is enough to have obviously one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.399
 playstation 3 slim from sweet gb and a hard 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 internal disk this internal hard disk 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.399
 will be inserted into our system 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 playstation and will allow us to expand 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 the memory precisely so keep still 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
 plus more pictures video games whatever 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 expand playstation memory 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.589
 which will allow us to have more data 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.990
 inside the memory what is there 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.170
 will allow to expand precisely the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.280
 this is the memory of the playstation 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.600
 this is an internal hard drive created 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.350
 from western digital 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.140
 as you can see western digital logo 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:33.329
 and weigh holds 500GB of memory is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:37.259
 written here the model is woody 5,000 l 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.200
 pvt this hard drive is 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.450
 affordable on a single-digit amazon 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.799
 really modest because sony sells 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 internal hard drives for the playstation 3 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.930
 but I have to say that I really am 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.790
 expensive because the sony sell hard drives 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.189
 from around 200 250 gigabytes at a price of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.710
 about between 90 and 100 euros 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.789
 therefore really very expensive instead 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.300
 this hard disk here is 500 giga and lo 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.270
 you can buy on amazon for about 50 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.920
 euro I do not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.570
 so much for less than 50 euros now not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.090
 I remember about 47 something anyway 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.110
 really a reasonable price 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.310
 the comparison to what sony offers though 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.510
 let's go straight to analyzing how 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.950
 insert this hard drive inside 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 of our playstation 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 then take our playstation 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.710
 which must be turned off with all cables 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.930
 detached without power supply without 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.360
 nothing I recommend you to have 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.650
 more security turn it over from this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.160
 part 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.880
 here there is a door that will be opened 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.130
 see the lid comes off and now 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.610
 no longer needed we take ours 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.240
 hard disk and we give in this compartment 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 as you can see there is a vain us 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.980
 let's go to insert it you see here is the 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.210
 door to open the disks in series us 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.950
 let's turn this way 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.400
 landis which must be inserted here 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 where is all this paper with with with 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.800
 the information in short of the hard disk 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.700
 on this side I recommend you do 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.590
 see well how it should be inserted there vi 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.870
 I recommend working on a plan because 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.880
 really easier on the plane there 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.160
 advises to have a lot of light then 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.709
 choices inside and you will hear until you do 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.560
 finished the hard disk in short, do not hear that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.230
 then he stuck well at this point 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.800
 resume the cover 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.680
 close the playstation 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.720
 eni attack all cables now what 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.640
 it will happen 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.800
 you turn on the playstation 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.650
 absent your TV and you will see that 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.400
 in short, the playstation will ask you to 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.320
 format data formatting of 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.090
 data will happen completely 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.520
 sure 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.890
 you will ask a couple of questions there 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.290
 playstation you click on yes 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.560
 don't worry there is no risk 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.170
 go safe I tell you I do yes and 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.760
 will start formatting the data 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.430
 present on the playstation 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.910
 that's why maybe he was less experienced 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.580
 What explains the formatting of the data 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.600
 the playstation formed rai data what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.350
 it means to format the data will transfer i 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.000
 data already present on the flash memory 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.520
 that is the memory of the playstation 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.580
 the data already present on the playstation li 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.740
 will transfer to the hard disk memory 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.540
 once the data is transferred 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.780
 from flash memory to memory 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.730
 hard disk data storage 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.320
 present on the flash memory will come 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.810
 eliminated 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.510
 so don't worry you will lose nothing 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.410
 data will have already been transferred to 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.580
 hard disk memory so when you 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.900
 when the playstation will be out of shape 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.680
 such data 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.880
 you will have your screen and could 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.919
 use the playstation exactly like 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.240
 he used it as you used it before not 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.190
 you will lose any data 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.830
 trust me nothing the tutorial ends 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.750
 here and I hope I have been helpful to 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:34.330
 many people who dreamed of expanding 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.750
 the memory of your own playstation 3 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.460
 slim from sweets jig so not too much 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.480
 expensive maybe not buying a new one 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.120
 500 GB flash memory playstation 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.110
 so I still hope I was 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.680
 useful to someone 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.530
