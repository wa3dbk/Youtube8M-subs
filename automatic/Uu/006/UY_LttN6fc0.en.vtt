00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 this lives welcome to a new chapter 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 of the ned culture but what the hell is it? 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.379
 success I sincerely hope that among you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.029
 let no one know what it is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.210
 a manga in which case I could have yours 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.210
 names 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 I'm waiting for jokes aside in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.330
 mangano are nothing but comics 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.300
 Japanese 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.300
 until now and manga I think back there 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.310
 there are mainly two types of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 shock manga 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.180
 the Venetians and lions 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.789
 the first intended for an audience 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.659
 female according to an audience 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.280
 male 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.020
 clearly there are various 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 features that distinguish a manga 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.460
 Western comics first of all yes 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 read starting from the bottom and from the right to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.860
 left 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.509
 I tell you because for years I have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
 stubborn to read the same manga in the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.189
 our traditional way not understanding us 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 a tube of course despite the page 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.630
 initial explaining how you zero 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.079
 manga but no one reads this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 stuff 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.159
 every comic book lover in general that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.619
 respect you can't not have two things 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.569
 the first is the precious protective bags 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.700
 allies against dust pro hold i 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.890
 our manga where reached sin that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.689
 there are an infinite number of standard measures 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.979
 weights to find the right one 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.780
 to freak out 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 just one volume is slightly more 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 great of others to fail to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.660
 enter the envelope is the second the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.849
 action figures the truth is that ours 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
 culture does not allow a 25-year-old to 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.150
 have these without others 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.940
 they ask if you still play with dolls 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.590
 they are models, not toys, and I am 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.130
 I already regret having pulled them out of the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 boxes 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.480
 and this is precisely what it is about 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.310
 culture is the case of the phenomenon of 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.319
 cosplay by us if I don't wear the costume 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.420
 near a cartoon fair you 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.940
 could reduce with the exception of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.880
 richard htt who is clearly disguised 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.739
 The characters of the Abruzzi 24 hours a day 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.540
 manga are characterized by ways of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.950
 make unmistakable habits for 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.519
 example they run one way 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.769
 incredibly ridiculous they wear 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.630
 always the same clothes from their nose 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.040
 spurts out of blood know 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.769
 what to do with things particularly 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.489
 provocative and the way they have to 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.359
 sitting down is very reminiscent of what we have 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.359
 us when we do 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 no I'm not passing the people in 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 japan is it gives so this is not my 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.220
 and how it could be missing as 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.290
 features to the famous triangle 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.340
 Japanese the two of them hate each other and yes 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.770
 they value he loves her but she loves him and him 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.720
 does not love nobody sleeps eats and does the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.640
 dark on duty is also interesting 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.070
 see the differences that occur from 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.500
 transposition of manga to the soul while 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.510
 the manga remains true to the original 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.520
 many soul in Italy are crippled 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.980
 in cartoons for 4-year-olds 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.780
 with all kinds of complaints and lengthened 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.730
 in the most hateful way to do a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.000
 example the first time that game becomes 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.680
 super sayan in the half page manga 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.410
 the first time goku gets super 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.060
 saiyan in the anime an episode perhaps 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.040
 even more before greeting you vi 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.590

 steve panda watch his videos 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.300
 because it really deserves 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.130
 you will still find the link of his 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.750
