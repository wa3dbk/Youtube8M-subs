00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
think he was going to the back to get a

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.569 
think he was going to the back to get a
mortgage<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.900> build<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.590> lot<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.070> think<00:04:20.519> you

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
mortgage to build a lot so I think you
