00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello tankers with you 40 tons 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.030
 and I just wanted to show how sometimes 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.609
 they play on art completely by chance and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.289
 and nobody knows guys look 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.660
 card ranger player plays pinocchio and 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 please come t-34 next to him 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 worth 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 m5 stuart shot and bang took two 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.640
 one shell well, in principle, that such 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 yes, like a little little firefly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 standing beside 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.700
 bombardier 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.640
 wait for this recharge terrible in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.489
 fifty five and a half seconds me 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.230
 It seems that this game is called Soul Slow 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.280
 they are the world of tanks 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.590
 so is the preparation for the next 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.670
 vyselivanie shot another victim 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.399
 yes so so so we wait we wait we wait a little 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 accelerate a little accelerate appear 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 of and so really want to get here 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.390
 this issue 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 nearly three seconds flying projectile releases 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 and incomprehensibly ready t29 splashes and only 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.070
 then burns down and die from such 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 the way our brave cheerful boratinka 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.270
 earns 2 scorers two 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 shots and here is his combat result but 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 in this battle the German is already on the tenth 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.700
 level on gvs it is only here 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 already happening a little more interesting 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.149
 the player sits on his head he knows what to splash 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 he has more and seems to be normal 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 work yes he just wants nadamazhit 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 enemy tanks as usual but look 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 how interesting is he doing when 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.950
 leave 113 yes and object 268 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 he specifically aim and throws a projectile 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.979
 between them and thus earns 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.580
 also scorer killing two at the same time 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.220
 tank but what happens next here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.230
 Perry is recharging zaryadochka fight 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.319
 starts to merge hard 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 our kaveshka rolls back ah how 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.440
 the tundra map looks like Karelia is made 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.470
 on the basis of an old familiar map 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.860
 here he rolls back to meet 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 the enemy of his last strength already everything remains 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.870
 one art and khevik not very far 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.980

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.459

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.129
 comes down well ka well ka let's wait to go 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:50.569
 hevik sees him turning 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:55.290
 look smears the shot and two more 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.849
 great guys regret in this fight all 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.940
 ended sadder 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.450
 even here such 2 scorers in a row not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.450
 allowed this player to defeat his 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.940
 combat result but guys it was very 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.310
 interesting and most importantly that I could not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.890
 give preference to any of the fights and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.769
 decided to show you both points at once 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.680
 well that such moments are in 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.910
 randomly wish you successful victories with you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.910
 was 40 tons
