hey everyone today I'm going to show you
a<00:00:02.820> very<00:00:03.540> cool<00:00:03.840> app<00:00:04.110> it's<00:00:04.380> called<00:00:04.440> good<00:00:05.130> reader

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
a very cool app it's called good reader

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.639 
a very cool app it's called good reader
and<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.029> would<00:00:06.210> recommend<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.379> one<00:00:07.589> of

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
and I would recommend this to be one of

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.940 
and I would recommend this to be one of
the<00:00:07.770> first<00:00:08.099> apps<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.700> get<00:00:09.050> for<00:00:10.050> your<00:00:10.230> iPad<00:00:10.679> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
the first apps you get for your iPad and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.209 
the first apps you get for your iPad and
what<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.450> much<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:13.219> file

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
what it is is it's pretty much a file

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.359 
what it is is it's pretty much a file
management<00:00:14.670> system<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.529> I<00:00:16.529> think<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
management system that I think is a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.189 
management system that I think is a
pretty<00:00:17.850> critical<00:00:18.060> thing<00:00:18.510> missing<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.369> the

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
pretty critical thing missing from the

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
pretty critical thing missing from the
built-in<00:00:22.199> apps<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.650> come<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.720> that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
built-in apps that come with the that

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
built-in apps that come with the that
come<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:24.990> Apple<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.980> I'll<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.609> ahead

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
come from Apple so I'll just go ahead

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.720 
come from Apple so I'll just go ahead
and<00:00:26.970> take<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.660> example<00:00:28.130> look<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> my

now<00:02:20.840> let's<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.980> we'll<00:02:22.760> hit<00:02:22.910> done<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
now let's see we'll hit done we want to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.950 
now let's see we'll hit done we want to
go<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.200> there<00:02:24.320> enter<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> password<00:02:28.840> what<00:02:29.840> else

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
go in there enter the password what else

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.300 
go in there enter the password what else
might<00:02:30.170> want<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.620> with<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> file<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:34.160> can

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
might want to do with a file we can

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.290 
might want to do with a file we can
email<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:35.530> let's<00:02:36.530> say<00:02:36.709> we<00:02:36.920> want<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.300> email

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
email it let's say we want it to email

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.130 
email it let's say we want it to email
this<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.350> click<00:02:39.709> on<00:02:39.860> email<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.900> that's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
this we just click on email and that's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.229 
this we just click on email and that's
going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> bring<00:02:42.500> up<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:45.610> ok<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.090> guess

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
going to bring up a ok and then I guess

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.250 
going to bring up a ok and then I guess
what<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.510> saying<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> can't<00:02:48.050> mail<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
what it's saying is you can't mail a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.840 
what it's saying is you can't mail a
whole<00:02:48.530> folder<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.130> we<00:02:49.250> would<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.550> go<00:02:49.700> in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
whole folder so we would have to go in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.430 
whole folder so we would have to go in
and<00:02:49.970> male<00:02:50.120> individual<00:02:50.600> files<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.610> also<00:02:52.850> rename

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
and male individual files we also rename

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.040 
and male individual files we also rename
unprotected<00:02:54.440> mark<00:02:55.400> read<00:02:55.640> or<00:02:55.760> unread<00:02:58.900> make<00:02:59.900> it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
unprotected mark read or unread make it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.270 
unprotected mark read or unread make it
a<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.530> do<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> very<00:03:02.150> robust<00:03:02.750> program<00:03:03.290> we

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
a to do this is a very robust program we

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.830 
a to do this is a very robust program we
can<00:03:04.430> also<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.760> back<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.120> main<00:03:05.270> thing<00:03:05.630> and

good reader your file management system

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.020 
good reader your file management system
here<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:41.099> it's<00:04:42.099> almost<00:04:42.280> like<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.580> finder

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
here and it's almost like the finder

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.899 
here and it's almost like the finder
that<00:04:43.419> was<00:04:43.539> missing<00:04:43.960> on<00:04:44.669> that<00:04:45.669> should<00:04:45.820> have

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
that was missing on that should have

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.180 
that was missing on that should have
been<00:04:45.940> provided<00:04:46.419> by<00:04:46.449> Apple<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.409> again<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:47.949> think

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
been provided by Apple so again I think
