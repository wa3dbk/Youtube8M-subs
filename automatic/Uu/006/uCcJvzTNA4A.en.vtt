00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 my complete set up because also the making 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.859
 In recent days that video 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.869

 happened and yes first and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.730
 most important and that is we have again 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 the 60,000 subscribers I don't know how long 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 the past is that we had a 50 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.470
 but two months ago or so 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.840
 there is a go for again on six things 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 less and less 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.820
 and that came mainly stupid old 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.340
 plot and so out but my mine 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 chips and my my views keep growing 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 I upload really crazy but less 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 the rest goes up so when i get there every 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 upload twice a day 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.399
 then I don't know what my channel is going for you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.680
 but that it rises green on the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.719
 fly away so 6 awesome 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 of the rest, 10 million views in total 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.190
 of course and fantastic too 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 a bit near the brook guys it's that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 extra we add them and that is also 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 fantastic so that is really thank you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.189
 or leveling serious thank you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 the rest new microphone or four of those 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 microphone the city microphone what is it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 are things on my new flashy penis 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 no this is one and I wind it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 first us a cow snack I want vw here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 until then so can you have such 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 trees so very good than this is I think 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 for personal fine so you can 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.829
 the sound is also something else I think 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 well but he can also body a pc or 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.560
 he still has to tweak many things 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 but i have a your pc short and that is yes 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 a custom calling pc means that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.759
 parts assembled themselves there is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.009
 new PC that I just shop through 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.579
 say i want that pc and i get you my 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.630
 ready 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.170
 no these are all parts that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 we have chosen ourselves and diarrhea 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 then put the website together 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 because I can't do it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.009
 I have had help with that from black 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 dragon also has a youtube channel 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.479
 you may know fat and met 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.340
 He also did the GTA and he 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 has a huge amount of file from PCs 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 so he helped me with this pc 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.799
 all specs read PCs then in the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.300
 description maybe just one 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.910
 description the ip or a link in the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.310
 description and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.540
 can your viewer sit in it i know so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.850
 all not to worry about I didn't 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.190
 real case understanding of PCs but it is 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.010
 an i7 it is 32 grams 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.390
 it is the gtx 980 super clock video card 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.000
 a yes i don't know it all 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 just to some people 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.660
 420 says of Dennis this is really complete 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.990
 over time because there are quite a lot of them 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.070
 random things in what is basically not 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.650
 Need 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.270
 and why is there basically like you 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830
 for example, play a game or play 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.070
 jacket minecraft you have those things man who 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.780
 but if you see you do then 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.700
 then you do quite a lot behind the computer and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.460
 you are very often busy editing 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.500
 And recode if you are always there 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.300
 can win in then you already have in principle 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 profit and that really was not me 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
 problem but it was the problem 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.880
 just no longer true if i video 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.550
 went to record then lick my gameplay 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.650
 no longer flush with the game sound and 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.730
 very often that he suddenly a piece 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.530
 beaten over by a whole 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.670
 hard to correct what is also whole 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.070
 hard to explain so if you like that 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.280
 prepared but not out but it came on 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.290
 down 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.270
 I really needed your PC so then know 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.550
 so what we are going to do well right away 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.709
 I ordered this PC and it currently is 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.810
 not quite done yet and top and walked 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.610
 mean is currently windows 7 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.110
 home premium on 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.670
 in the summer you can probably do that 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.010
 had heard about upgrading to windows 10 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.290
 and then I can make full use of it 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.970
 that 20 grams of well I can have a maximum of 16 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.330
 gram use due to windows 7 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.600
 so that would be very nice even the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.260
 car completely 32 can where we have so far 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.400
 I am very happy with that 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.810
 it was only a bit at the beginning 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.290
 problems because they have all sorts of things 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.280
 different things all update and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.030
 download and set up a lot 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.560
 programs 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.930
 don't all start flawlessly why 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.670
 where also my webcam that it worked 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.440
 I didn't really have it all day yesterday 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 along with black dragon 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.870
 worked 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.520
 until it finally worked and we were 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.950
 really because two and a half past two we pass her 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.570
 ready so i said it really shoutout to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.980
 black dragon he really got me 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.510
 helped with things else I have to 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.890
 not finished 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.870
 and that is also a bit redouan 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.130
 no videos came i come on an old pc 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.790
 but who also decides that 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.989
 plugged in 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.700
 I was very busy with my new PC 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.049
 therefore balance in videos 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.950
 probably started tomorrow again 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.950
 begin where scales 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.140
 the first big, a few million dollars and 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.700
 maybe even one and at francois a 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.800
 video or maybe spots on him as 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.840
 Watch that from calorie to video to more 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.310
 plain to tell what my opinion is 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.510
 about black like three because a lot of people 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.360
 We also know it anyway 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.860
 And yes I am always really one 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.110
 present the guy i still think it is 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.370
 great for playing but for videos 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.670
 I think it is too transferable 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.100
 not so nice anymore but I'll go anyway 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.690
 do something about redo 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.640
 this is the that is the medal for tomorrow 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.740
 today could therefore no longer be online 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.810
 only have this video I think best 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.460
 reach my pc 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.080
 so it's for a closet so you look 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.800
 not very much about it is the course and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.450
 750 d that the cabinet have very large closet 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.550
 I have a lot of space by one and yes 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.530
 that is perhaps for the future therefore 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.570
 also contains a heavy diet 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.420
 for maybe if i do i have an extra 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.310
 want to add video card then I have 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.630
 room for that and greasy rest of airflow 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.850
 is of course also good 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.580
 so let's take a look at that name 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.680
 in which cupboard and the go 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.240
 ok this is so you know my setup 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.730
 my setup and if you don't you must 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.400
 really machete watching video there is mio crazy 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.430
 a lot has changed here so that who or 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.650
 a lot of tractor at no extra costs it 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 the detuned PC 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.220
 and so this is the pc I just got 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.270
 purchased sound somersaults we are 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.880
 this one 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.310
 a little room but this is the case is 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.740
 a choir imagines 5d so i had my 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.460
 pocket already and you see in the front 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.240
 I deliberately chose not to give me CD stuff 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.740
 and to do 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.930
 simply because your cd is nowadays 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.360
 actually no longer used or DVDs and 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.210
 I really like the closet a bit 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.250
 screw up so I have an external DVD 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.320
 bought a drive for it, was I ever allowed 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.970
 anything else 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 yes you know wanna play it has this 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.900
 week especially then I can use that 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.720
 it is there above the sun but then 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.690
 quite i think it is very nice design 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.710
 real aluminum or anonymous 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.150
 he is clear it is not plastic that 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.200
 clean your fans room 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.860
 easy peasy lemon squeezy 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.390
 yes that is close the closet years of 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.870
 of this I can see three on side 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.060
 fourth panel but we don't really look 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.180
 so much to wear is all 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.890
 extremely dark and there is also a huge one 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.990
 account I'm probably going tomorrow 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.640
 reconnect everything with van 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.320
 which cable troughs they all just like this 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.800
 sees but little smoothness that I 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.960
 stuff 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.370
 brother and things as important and then 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.020
 my pc will probably stand 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.760
 and then they can also look for I 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.470
 maybe make another one soon 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.510
 new cell video but I'll go first 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:03.280
 news to buy and then so what to 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.900
 Seeing is all changed to until 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.240
 not much has changed so far 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.700
 so so just was n't right on it 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.710
 kingdom would double viewers 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:17.170

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:19.330

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.810
 so I take this as me 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.790
 here let me sound through density and yes 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.840
 there is not much more to it 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.750

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.640
 so here the mess is not whole 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.430
 many special, most sustainable releases 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.770
 but and this is the way pc 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.650
 if you look me up, look for 750 dough 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.150
 crust and s15 idea then you see me with my

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.560
 This is why you could have everything clean 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.150
 to hold 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.300
