00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
tunnel vision and then I start losing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.729 
tunnel vision and then I start losing
game<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.210> because

game so that's what I don't want because

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
game so that's what I don't want because
they<00:01:04.739> definitely<00:01:05.189> lose<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.790> points<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

lose I lose like 20 points compared to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600 
lose I lose like 20 points compared to
10<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.570> 5<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.530> any<00:01:10.680> regular<00:01:11.159> player<00:01:11.369> will
