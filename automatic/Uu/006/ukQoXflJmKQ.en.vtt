got a number chances you know we made a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.310 
got a number chances you know we made a
good<00:01:13.160> team<00:01:13.220> today<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.420> goalkeeper<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.080> thought

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
good team today the goalkeeper I thought

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.850 
good team today the goalkeeper I thought
played<00:01:15.560> well<00:01:17.140> they<00:01:18.140> would<00:01:18.320> tough<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.650> break

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
played well they would tough to break

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.760 
played well they would tough to break
down<00:01:19.270> obviously<00:01:20.270> as<00:01:20.660> as<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:21.380> got<00:01:21.560> into<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
down obviously as as we got into the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.060 
down obviously as as we got into the
second<00:01:22.250> half<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.729> they<00:01:23.570> muscled<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.560> little

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
second half and they muscled a little

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.090 
second half and they muscled a little
energy<00:01:25.460> they<00:01:25.900> lost<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:27.050> shape<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.530> game<00:01:27.710> opened

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
energy they lost a shape the game opened

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.010 
energy they lost a shape the game opened
up<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.369> little<00:01:28.580> bit<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.880> we<00:01:29.630> were<00:01:29.750> able<00:01:29.810> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
up a little bit and we were able to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.780 
up a little bit and we were able to
produce<00:01:30.200> some<00:01:30.560> goals<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:31.040> thought<00:01:31.550> up

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
produce some goals I thought up

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.690 
produce some goals I thought up
defensively<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:33.080> backline<00:01:33.979> played<00:01:34.250> real<00:01:34.520> well

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
defensively a backline played real well

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.380 
defensively a backline played real well
today<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.540> good<00:01:35.840> game<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.350> think<00:01:36.890> oil<00:01:37.390> lines

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
today so the good game I think oil lines

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.260 
today so the good game I think oil lines
played<00:01:38.720> extremely<00:01:39.170> well<00:01:39.320> for<00:01:39.530> more<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:41.030> finish

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
played extremely well for more to finish

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.630 
played extremely well for more to finish
one<00:01:41.720> midfielder<00:01:42.229> from<00:01:42.650> line<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.160> it<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.610> a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
one midfielder from line so it was a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.780 
one midfielder from line so it was a
good<00:01:43.850> day<00:01:44.060> certainly<00:01:45.070> far<00:01:46.070> from<00:01:46.280> perfect<00:01:46.550> but

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
good day certainly far from perfect but

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.480 
good day certainly far from perfect but
