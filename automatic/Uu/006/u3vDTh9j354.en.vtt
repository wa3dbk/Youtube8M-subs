blender and that you're gonna add a
little<00:03:21.079> bit<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.290> water<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.159> a<00:03:22.190> brine<00:03:22.900> and

you only want to add enough water to get

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.680 
you only want to add enough water to get
it<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.840> go<00:03:27.230> around<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.739> blender<00:03:28.099> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.700> had

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
it to go around the blender so I had

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.720 
it to go around the blender so I had
about<00:03:29.840> 3/4<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.890> cup<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.190> I've<00:03:31.310> only<00:03:31.459> put

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
about 3/4 of a cup and I've only put

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.470 
about 3/4 of a cup and I've only put
about<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.450> half<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.470> cup<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.160> there<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.239> need<00:03:35.450> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
about a half a cup in there so I need a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.449 
about a half a cup in there so I need a
little<00:03:35.840> bit<00:03:35.959> more<00:03:36.200> water<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:37.040> I'm<00:03:37.160> just<00:03:37.310> going

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
little bit more water so I'm just going

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.729 
little bit more water so I'm just going
to<00:03:37.489> pour<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:38.150> until<00:03:39.109> I<00:03:39.140> see<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.590> it's

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
to pour that in until I see that it's

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.280 
to pour that in until I see that it's
moving<00:03:39.980> around<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.400> blender<00:03:40.730> pretty<00:03:40.940> easily

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
moving around the blender pretty easily

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.849 
moving around the blender pretty easily
there<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.440> go

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
there we go

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.730 
there we go
and<00:03:43.430> turn<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:43.819> up<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.090> little<00:03:44.269> bit

we're going to take this mixture and put
it<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.110> our<00:04:35.349> airtight<00:04:35.949> jar<00:04:36.430> important<00:04:37.210> thing

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
it in our airtight jar important thing

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.450 
it in our airtight jar important thing
about<00:04:37.629> doing<00:04:38.020> fermented<00:04:38.500> vegetables<00:04:39.039> is<00:04:39.219> as

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
about doing fermented vegetables is as

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.240 
about doing fermented vegetables is as
you're<00:04:39.939> packing<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.539> into<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.110> jar<00:04:41.439> you<00:04:42.009> want

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
you're packing it into the jar you want

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.309 
you're packing it into the jar you want
to<00:04:42.370> pack<00:04:42.759> it<00:04:43.000> down<00:04:43.030> tightly<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.050> use<00:04:44.289> a

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
to pack it down tightly so I use a

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.129 
to pack it down tightly so I use a
wooden<00:04:44.560> spoon<00:04:44.860> with<00:04:45.219> a<00:04:45.250> long<00:04:45.550> handle<00:04:45.849> and<00:04:46.360> pack

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
wooden spoon with a long handle and pack

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.570 
wooden spoon with a long handle and pack
it<00:04:47.289> down<00:04:47.409> tightly<00:04:47.680> because<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.159> fermentation

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
it down tightly because the fermentation

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.909 
it down tightly because the fermentation
process<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.599> something<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.169> occurs<00:04:50.469> without

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
process is something that occurs without

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.760 
process is something that occurs without
oxygen<00:04:51.669> to<00:04:52.569> remove<00:04:52.960> any<00:04:53.139> air<00:04:53.319> because<00:04:53.680> you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
oxygen to remove any air because you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.559 
oxygen to remove any air because you
want<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.009> try<00:04:54.159> and<00:04:54.310> fit<00:04:54.490> as<00:04:54.639> much<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.389> this

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
want to try and fit as much of this

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.719 
want to try and fit as much of this
vegetable<00:04:55.840> mixture<00:04:56.590> into<00:04:56.889> this<00:04:57.159> jar<00:04:57.550> as

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729

possible<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.689> I've<00:04:59.379> removed<00:04:59.710> as<00:04:59.860> much<00:04:59.889> air<00:05:00.340> as

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
possible and I've removed as much air as

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.330 
possible and I've removed as much air as
possible<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:01.150> what<00:05:01.810> I've<00:05:01.960> done<00:05:02.169> in<00:05:02.439> to<00:05:03.129> fill

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
because there's going to be a little bit

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.100 
because there's going to be a little bit
error<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:06.879> the<00:05:07.090> top<00:05:07.300> so<00:05:07.539> you<00:05:07.569> can<00:05:07.900> take<00:05:08.080> some

error on the top so you can take some

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.409 
error on the top so you can take some

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
took off some of the leaves before I

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.140 
took off some of the leaves before I
chopped<00:05:14.919> up<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.219> cabbage<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.669> I<00:05:15.699> could<00:05:15.879> use<00:05:16.120> it
