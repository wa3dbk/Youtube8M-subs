that I use to pop frames out
I<00:00:10.200> don't<00:00:10.830> visit<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.400> lives<00:00:11.840> very<00:00:12.840> often<00:00:13.349> during

they're very pro peláez din fact these

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.599 
they're very pro peláez din fact these
supers<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:20.760> getting<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:22.830> extracting

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
supers I'm getting and I'm extracting

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.900 
supers I'm getting and I'm extracting
honey<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.320> visited<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:26.099> since

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
honey from I have not visited them since

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630 
honey from I have not visited them since
I<00:00:27.060> put<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> frames<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.830> since<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I put the frames or since I put the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
I put the frames or since I put the
super'<00:00:29.939> Zone<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.420> March<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> everything's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
super' Zone in in March so everything's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.810 
super' Zone in in March so everything's
well<00:00:32.579> localized<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.890> as<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.950> result<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> makes

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
well localized and as a result it makes

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.720 
well localized and as a result it makes
it<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:36.030> hard<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> frames<00:00:36.899> out

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
it very hard to get the frames out

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.750 
it very hard to get the frames out
therefore<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.290> board<00:00:43.760> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
therefore when I use is this board you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.660 
therefore when I use is this board you
place<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.300> super<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.140> top<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
place the super on top of there and I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.260 
place the super on top of there and I
just<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> rubber<00:00:48.960> mallet<00:00:52.760> net<00:00:53.760> pops<00:00:54.030> all

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
just use a rubber mallet net pops all

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.709 
just use a rubber mallet net pops all
frames<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.449> then<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.600> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
frames out for you and then you can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.600 
frames out for you and then you can
easily<00:00:57.870> pry<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.530> apart<00:00:58.730> for<00:00:59.730> extraction

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.000 

I'll<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.210> more<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:07.010> either

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
I'll have a little bit more here either

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
I'll have a little bit more here either
in<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.460> extension<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> video<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:10.470> in

another one showing you some more steps
in<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.380> process

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.410 

a<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.780> example<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.280> brain<00:02:08.280> kept<00:02:08.640> well<00:02:09.209> on

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
a good example of brain kept well on

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:47.020 
a good example of brain kept well on
both<00:02:09.630> sides

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:03:22.120 

the<00:02:48.030> extractor<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.900> right

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.790 

these<00:03:22.700> are<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.030> done

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.350 

this<00:03:28.370> one<00:03:28.700> those<00:03:29.660> are<00:03:29.960> done<00:03:30.640> got<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:32.000> two

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
this one those are done got one two

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.460 
this one those are done got one two
three<00:03:32.780> four<00:03:33.560> five<00:03:33.860> left<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.310> do
