00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 I always share in the market 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.829
 these are the three positions of the police that is 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.979
 the first place is which 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.939
 The goal is a very large selection of different 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.569
 companies then come books you can 

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:35.630
 order and anyone anything 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 Well, actually I personally think that this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.390
 their work does not end that is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.100
 This is true 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 for me it is called June 5 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.490
 magazine or addresses on the internet here i will go 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.870
 looked at them 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 if we talk about 10 about what 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.560
 buddy care but why why not 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.930
 that is good because any tasks 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.000
 agencies to give some kind of guarantee that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.950
 those people that I recommend tires 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.630
 really doing well 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.750
 and since this line is political 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.470
 campaigns there from iraq operators photographers 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.800
 it is impossible to do 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.820
 because at least you need at least 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.390
 once each of these is an idea I work 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.850
 I am sure that such work with him 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 happens 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.710
 that is why there are such so-called 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.340
 cancels dealers 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 second abortion is not coquetry 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.480
 I think this unity is sufficient 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.590
 such normal money with which 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 comfortable work for any client 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 I have a wedding there are some questions 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.290
 I can say what a separate table is 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.270
 for example, a car is just 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 went to the agency accidentally saw both 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 the car 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.829
 here is this agency which is so quiet 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.119
 you leading expert as well 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.440
 it is recommended that they know here 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.649
 and indeed such systems 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.640
 but there is unity 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 and Japan flew category of agencies 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.900
 but for me personally of course 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.100
 there are errors these categories but was in 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.630
 pipe end 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.540
 she is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.080
 for me personally there is another agency 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.990
 besides on the growth of which is about fire 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.509
 and before which you shoot no 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.329
 but because these are really people 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.909
 who hold class activities 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.669
 that's about this attitude 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.409
 customers which gives me seems 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.509
 petroleum products 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.569
 I'm pretty sure 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.409
 because of course that punishment centers 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.829
 in specifics 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.689
 But for me, I repeat it is very important 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.189
 give the client peace of mind 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.430
 it's hard to feel that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.549
 there is someone who saw them 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.059
 really that is, we are that boat in 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.869
 which the client sits down 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.179
 for the same purpose attack arguments 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:46.010
 championship which was in full swing 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 talk about what we worked with 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.600
 standing team which is 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560
 the best on the market I'm no longer being that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.869
 Sevastopol said 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.799
 a percentage of this will tell the children it 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.659
 thank you team very much 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.549
 grateful to 10 5 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.809
 exclusives or not this performance 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.010
 gather team also says she 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.089
 OK 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.999
 but percent 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.179
 we first of all is very 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.559
 high-quality performer ill 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:15.759
 for his work 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.079
 and actually engaged 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.099
 fully control with you that is how are you 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.620
 see we are engaged 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.439
 Rosatom is not only 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.989
 how are you organizing weddings festive 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.069
 events that concern and exhibitions 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.769
 discount magazines and various interesting 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.260
 share and all this is contacting you 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.860
 because this market is very interesting 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.790
 she can study it 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.710
 very long year and he really 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.140
 is a son very cool it seems to me 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.199
 what do you think that the pace of development 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.729
 this is the most important thing now 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.369
 we have this 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.469
 what the doctors emphasize the authors 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.809
 report 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.809
 on the eve of this time have become usually 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.389
 the question is just enough what 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.299
 just do not have to 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.620
 and this is not unpleasant because to me 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.670
 Comes girls not only annuls 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.529
 acts of the dismemberment of the book 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.229
 they come she girls who 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.799
 work in all cities in which 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.059
 agencies 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.409
 experience more than me 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.719
 and they come to study this 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.259
 surely wait for me the highest praise 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.840
 recount what if 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.039
 now willing to pay money question is it 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.830
 market participants it already says a lot 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.620
 so for me this is especially in gratitude 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.580
 and an indicator of glittering report 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.680
 the institute 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.150
 and naturally there is a market up let's say 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.610
 a man 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.569
 rightness of the second 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.289
 this is probably our meeting with Yushchenko with tons 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.620
 of course makes our agency 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.169
 number of tornado casualties in southern 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.120
 Carolina probably doesn't do anybody here 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.740
 support 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.059
 they trust us 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.709
 new girls are coming 

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.899
 like working with us and again 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.509
 All our customers are very demanding 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.460
 he is not 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.940
 making submissions 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.900
 brought injuries 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.940
 as it contradicts and will 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.069
 a lot of adults and children 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.449
 there for 30 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.300
 that is, people who are taking into account 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.980
 general the moscow post as these services 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.920
 a lot of people who are partially 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.629
 look 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:32.669
 around the world 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.669
 here 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.419
 Here I am and so for us of course very 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.189
 show exactly 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.659
 so for us there is no this system from work 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.639
 take money from them to me New York court and 45 million 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.490
 sometimes these figures are like at this time 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.610
 really quality service 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.860
 because today 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.289
 to organize a wedding just seems to me 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.979
 much higher there is difficult for 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.900
 normal agency 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.110
 but to sell to the client I want to say that 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.770
 next wednesday so 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.960
 you raise him 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.770
 outfit is harder 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.389
 so we will score 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.309
 so our experiment in projects
