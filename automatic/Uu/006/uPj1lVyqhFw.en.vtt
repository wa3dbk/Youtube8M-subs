00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
leaves and you know if those were

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
leaves and you know if those were
leaving<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.250> residue<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.940> really

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
leaving your residue you just really

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
leaving your residue you just really
wouldn't<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> whereas<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> quartz<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.010> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
wouldn't see it whereas on a quartz or a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
wouldn't see it whereas on a quartz or a
plaster<00:01:17.490> finish<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.880> could<00:01:20.120> and<00:01:21.350> get<00:01:22.350> back

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
plaster finish you could and get back

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
plaster finish you could and get back
over<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.120> I'll<00:01:24.120> hang<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:26.090> spawn<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
over here I'll hang this spawn the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.370 
over here I'll hang this spawn the
reason<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.510> give<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.690> this<00:01:27.810> shot<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
reason I give you this shot you know you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.650 
reason I give you this shot you know you
can<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> sense<00:01:29.730> of<00:01:29.970> what

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
can kind of so you get a sense of what

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.650 
can kind of so you get a sense of what
size<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.320> depth<00:01:31.590> does<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.160> water<00:01:32.340> color

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
size and depth does to water color

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.750 
size and depth does to water color
obviously<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.870> spa<00:01:34.320> being<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> smaller<00:01:35.520> body

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
obviously the spa being a smaller body

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960 
obviously the spa being a smaller body
of<00:01:36.000> water<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.720> deep<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> pool<00:01:37.970> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of water and not as deep as the pool you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.200 
of water and not as deep as the pool you
get<00:01:39.120> a<00:01:39.150> different<00:01:39.710> color<00:01:40.730> water<00:01:41.730> color<00:01:41.970> in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
get a different color water color in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
get a different color water color in
each<00:01:42.330> in<00:01:42.690> each<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.770> each<00:01:43.830> part<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> pool

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
each in each in each part of the pool

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.110 
each in each in each part of the pool
here<00:01:45.440> so<00:01:46.440> this<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.310> pool<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.790> bigger

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
here so this same pool a little bigger

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.700 
here so this same pool a little bigger
when<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.230> colors<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.620> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
when you know the colors would be a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.780 
when you know the colors would be a
little<00:01:49.860> darker<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.190> little<00:01:50.250> smaller<00:01:50.700> than

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
little darker a little smaller than

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
little darker a little smaller than
lighten<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.600> again<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.990> size<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
lighten up so again the size and the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
lighten up so again the size and the
color<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.670> size<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.150> depth<00:01:57.440> go<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.470> long

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
color the size and the depth go a long

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.000 
color the size and the depth go a long
way<00:01:59.270> in<00:02:00.270> helping<00:02:00.480> you<00:02:00.690> determine<00:02:01.320> water<00:02:01.770> color

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
way in helping you determine water color

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.160 
way in helping you determine water color
also<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:03.150> back<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.660> rocks<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
also going back to the rocks and the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
also going back to the rocks and the
plants<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:05.400> these<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:05.940> lot<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> lot

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
plants you know these are a lot of a lot

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.139 
plants you know these are a lot of a lot
of<00:02:06.390> earth<00:02:06.570> tones<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:07.280> lot<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> natural<00:02:08.819> colors

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of earth tones a lot of natural colors

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.929
