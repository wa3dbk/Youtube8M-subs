00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.240
 Hello friends today I want 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.830
 make a very active medium for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:27.529
 cleaning the surface did the bike 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.529
 baby after his stayed 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 Fryazino 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.930
 That came across you understand that not very 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 affable and very removed there 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.170
 the whole 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.620
 bath surface suffered very 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.719
 Seriously 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.719
 Well Well here I go and stepped network 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.670
 planet 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.920
 bosch 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.850
 or tomorrow i 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 own 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.060
 just a tool in the form of the back of the head with normal 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:17.110
 ordinary roots let's 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 this action here 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080
 to wet 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.930
 further just 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:12.590
 these places are clearly Tibetan 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 thin layer 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.720
 means I ask 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:03:00.980
 the cost of it quite a bit waiting 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:04.180
 literally here probably a little bit 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.180
 funds began to act 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.510
 then 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.980
 the sum itself is very happy here and see how 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.980
 it was watching 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:30.319
 nothing remains here is 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.120
 also wind 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.690
 if a 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.690
 very effective 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.240
 so here 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.620
 bathing on you even if 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.690
 very crazy for black 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.780
 perfect cleaning 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.780
 included 1 2 3 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.390
 want to say so 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.810
 this tool is very well washed off 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.810
 there is no trace left very 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:24.090
 recommended 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.090
 this is a test for bath cleaning names when 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:35.730
 it is safe for very well washed off 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.730
 surface 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.980
 pure water 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.160
 where not 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.570
 need to take one more detail that given 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.800
 completely harmless to enamel 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.260
 the enamel itself does not corrode 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.270
 romance just remove very carefully 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:08.820
 so you can safely use 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:13.070
 for cleaning bowls of van for museum shells 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.070
 or by pain I seconded surfaces
