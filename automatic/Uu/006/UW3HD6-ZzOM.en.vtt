00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.470 

I<00:00:05.040> suppose<00:00:06.040> what's<00:00:06.250> so<00:00:06.400> exciting<00:00:06.700> about<00:00:07.000> this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480 
I suppose what's so exciting about this

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.879 
I suppose what's so exciting about this
shows<00:00:07.720> it's<00:00:08.050> really<00:00:08.440> the<00:00:08.530> first<00:00:08.680> opportunity

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
shows it's really the first opportunity

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.950 
shows it's really the first opportunity
that<00:00:09.430> people<00:00:09.970> in<00:00:10.059> Russia<00:00:10.240> have<00:00:10.450> had<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.780> see

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
that people in Russia have had to see

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.920 
that people in Russia have had to see
the<00:00:11.139> enormous<00:00:11.590> variety<00:00:11.770> of<00:00:12.490> Blake's<00:00:13.299> outputs

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
the enormous variety of Blake's outputs

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.080 
the enormous variety of Blake's outputs
as<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.080> visual<00:00:14.410> artist<00:00:14.940> particularly<00:00:15.940> these

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
as a visual artist particularly these

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.540 
as a visual artist particularly these
better<00:00:16.390> known<00:00:16.600> as<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.810> poet<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.170> suppose

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
better known as a poet I suppose

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.279 
better known as a poet I suppose
overseas<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:18.880> what<00:00:19.570> we've<00:00:19.720> tried<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.990> do

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
overseas and what we've tried to do

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.349 
overseas and what we've tried to do
within<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.710> structure<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.250> show<00:00:21.550> is<00:00:21.820> to

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
within the structure of the show is to

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.689 
within the structure of the show is to
group<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.689> works<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:24.070> demonstrate<00:00:24.580> the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
group the works to demonstrate the

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.249 
group the works to demonstrate the
different<00:00:24.970> themes<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.449> different<00:00:25.599> subjects

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
different themes and different subjects

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.710 
different themes and different subjects
that<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.439> tackled<00:00:26.859> and<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:27.820> there's<00:00:28.390> one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
that you tackled and so there's one

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.570 
that you tackled and so there's one
group<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.019> works<00:00:29.230> that<00:00:29.500> looks<00:00:29.769> at<00:00:30.099> his<00:00:30.400> own

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
group of works that looks at his own

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.150 
group of works that looks at his own
mythologies<00:00:30.910> really<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.779> an<00:00:31.869> extent<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.529> also

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
mythologies really to an extent and also

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.980 
mythologies really to an extent and also
his<00:00:33.340> use<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.550> colour<00:00:34.000> printing<00:00:34.450> which<00:00:34.630> is<00:00:34.660> a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
his use of colour printing which is a

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.290 
his use of colour printing which is a
completely<00:00:35.590> inventive<00:00:36.220> technique<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:37.090> he

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
completely inventive technique that he

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.920 
completely inventive technique that he
he<00:00:38.079> created<00:00:38.500> himself<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:40.030> then<00:00:40.270> in<00:00:40.600> another

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
he created himself and then in another

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.779 
he created himself and then in another
group<00:00:41.170> we<00:00:41.320> look<00:00:41.350> at<00:00:41.590> his<00:00:41.770> biblical<00:00:41.980> subjects

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
group we look at his biblical subjects

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.330 
group we look at his biblical subjects
for<00:00:42.969> example<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.110> an<00:00:44.530> extent<00:00:44.860> these<00:00:45.039> are

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
for example so to an extent these are

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.860 
for example so to an extent these are
images<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.030> are<00:00:46.180> perhaps<00:00:46.390> more<00:00:46.690> familiar

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
images that are perhaps more familiar

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.930 
images that are perhaps more familiar
but<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:47.949> Blake's<00:00:48.190> hands<00:00:48.460> they<00:00:48.640> become

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
but in Blake's hands they become

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.910 
but in Blake's hands they become
something<00:00:49.180> completely<00:00:49.680> unique<00:00:50.680> and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
something completely unique and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.680 
something completely unique and
individual<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.699> really<00:00:52.000> shows<00:00:52.329> his<00:00:52.570> own

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
individual it really shows his own

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.750 
individual it really shows his own
reading<00:00:53.109> of<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.320> Bible<00:00:53.770> something<00:00:54.430> which<00:00:54.579> is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
reading of the Bible something which is

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.319 
reading of the Bible something which is
completely<00:00:55.949> idiosyncratic<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.190> then<00:00:57.820> in<00:00:58.210> the

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
completely idiosyncratic and then in the

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.509 
completely idiosyncratic and then in the
colonnade<00:00:58.719> we<00:00:59.320> look<00:00:59.469> at<00:00:59.590> his<00:00:59.739> responses<00:01:00.250> to

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
colonnade we look at his responses to

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.270 
colonnade we look at his responses to
other<00:01:00.760> writers<00:01:01.239> Dante<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.379> Milton<00:01:03.070> and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
other writers Dante and Milton and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.510 
other writers Dante and Milton and
Spencer<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.840> we<00:01:05.140> look<00:01:05.260> again<00:01:05.530> at<00:01:05.800> how<00:01:06.460> he

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
Spencer and so we look again at how he

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.820 
Spencer and so we look again at how he
would<00:01:06.790> take<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.030> text<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.690> reinterpret<00:01:08.440> it<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
would take a text and reinterpret it and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.030 
would take a text and reinterpret it and
make<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.009> new<00:01:09.189> visual<00:01:09.549> language<00:01:09.580> around<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.280 

well<00:01:15.040> usually<00:01:15.300> well<00:01:16.300> most<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.960> works<00:01:17.140> that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
well usually well most of the works that

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.050 
well usually well most of the works that
you<00:01:17.440> see<00:01:17.620> on<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.800> walls<00:01:17.980> come<00:01:18.280> from<00:01:18.520> tapes<00:01:18.850> own

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
you see on the walls come from tapes own

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.970 
you see on the walls come from tapes own
collection<00:01:19.690> with<00:01:19.870> some<00:01:20.320> loans<00:01:20.530> from<00:01:20.740> other

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
collection with some loans from other

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.070 
collection with some loans from other
collections<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.730> UK<00:01:22.060> as<00:01:22.210> well<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.750> of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
collections in the UK as well and of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.660 
collections in the UK as well and of
course<00:01:23.140> usually<00:01:23.530> we<00:01:23.830> are<00:01:23.860> under<00:01:24.100> very<00:01:24.280> strict

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
course usually we are under very strict

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.300 
course usually we are under very strict
controls<00:01:25.300> about<00:01:25.600> how<00:01:26.410> long<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:26.980> show<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
controls about how long we can show the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.040 
controls about how long we can show the
works<00:01:27.490> for<00:01:27.790> because<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> exposure<00:01:28.810> to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
works for because of the exposure to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.960 
works for because of the exposure to
light<00:01:29.260> can<00:01:29.650> lead<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.070> fading<00:01:30.310> in<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.580> colors

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
light can lead to fading in the colors

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.540 
light can lead to fading in the colors
and<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.300> drawing<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.900> so<00:01:32.560> often<00:01:33.010> it<00:01:33.130> takes<00:01:33.280> we

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
and the drawing and so often it takes we

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.100 
and the drawing and so often it takes we
only<00:01:33.670> show<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.000> few<00:01:34.360> at<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.540> time<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.020> then

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
only show a few at a time and then

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.170 
only show a few at a time and then
they're<00:01:35.260> taken<00:01:35.590> back<00:01:35.770> into<00:01:35.920> storage<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
they're taken back into storage and it's

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.990 
they're taken back into storage and it's
been<00:01:37.420> well<00:01:37.990> over<00:01:38.410> 10<00:01:38.890> years<00:01:39.160> maybe<00:01:39.430> 12<00:01:39.760> years

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
been well over 10 years maybe 12 years

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.880 
been well over 10 years maybe 12 years
since<00:01:40.210> we've<00:01:40.420> seen<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.870> many<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:41.380> together<00:01:41.560> in

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
since we've seen so many all together in

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.190 
since we've seen so many all together in
one<00:01:41.920> place<00:01:42.100> even<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.120> Britain<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.080> is

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
one place even in Britain so this is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.750 
one place even in Britain so this is
really<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.590> kind<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.890> first<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> generation

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
really a kind of first for a generation

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.400 
really a kind of first for a generation
if<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.090> like<00:01:46.330> not<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:46.930> Russia<00:01:47.080> but

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
if you like not just in Russia but

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.780 
if you like not just in Russia but
actually<00:01:47.800> in<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.070> whole<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.430> world

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
actually in the whole of the world

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.440 
actually in the whole of the world
I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.310> Pushkin<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.940> perfect

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
I think the Pushkin is the perfect

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.969 
I think the Pushkin is the perfect
setting<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.140> was<00:01:53.170> actually<00:01:53.410> saying<00:01:53.860> to

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
setting and I was actually saying to

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.950 
setting and I was actually saying to
somebody<00:01:54.190> just<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.610> second<00:01:54.940> ago<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.720> think

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
somebody just a second ago that I think

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.480 
somebody just a second ago that I think
Blake<00:01:56.140> would<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.440> loved<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:57.010> seen<00:01:57.280> his

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
Blake would have loved to have seen his

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.370 
Blake would have loved to have seen his
works<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.880> exhibition<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.810> mean<00:01:59.200> not<00:01:59.350> only

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
works on exhibition here I mean not only

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.230 
works on exhibition here I mean not only
because<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.010> have<00:02:00.160> sculptures<00:02:01.060> by

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
because you have sculptures by

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.000 
because you have sculptures by
Michelangelo<00:02:02.080> next<00:02:02.440> door<00:02:02.619> he's<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:02.979> of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
Michelangelo next door he's one of

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.670 
Michelangelo next door he's one of
Blake's<00:02:03.490> greatest<00:02:03.940> heroes<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:04.990> also<00:02:05.170> because

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
Blake's greatest heroes but also because

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.830 
Blake's greatest heroes but also because
you<00:02:05.830> can<00:02:05.979> see<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.340> some<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.580> his<00:02:06.790> works<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.390> look

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you can see in some of his works a look

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.000 
you can see in some of his works a look
which<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.140> quite<00:02:08.350> similar<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> Russian

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
which is quite similar to the Russian

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.490 
which is quite similar to the Russian
icon<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:10.090> kind<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.360> use<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.510> tempera<00:02:11.170> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
icon this kind of use of tempera and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.460 
icon this kind of use of tempera and
gold<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.310> these<00:02:12.670> quite<00:02:12.940> static<00:02:13.360> figures<00:02:13.990> so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
gold and these quite static figures so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.720 
gold and these quite static figures so
there's<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> real<00:02:14.800> connection<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.400> think<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
there's a real connection I think it's a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.759 
there's a real connection I think it's a
Russian<00:02:16.030> arts<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.630> also<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:17.530> he<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
Russian arts and also I think he just

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.140 
Russian arts and also I think he just
would<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.040> been<00:02:18.190> very<00:02:18.340> interested<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
would have been very interested in the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.400 
would have been very interested in the
culture<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.570> Russia<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.989> way<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.290> which

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
culture in Russia the way in which

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.979 
culture in Russia the way in which
people<00:02:20.739> engage<00:02:20.920> quite<00:02:21.790> emotionally<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
people engage quite emotionally with the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.210 
people engage quite emotionally with the
works<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.470> see<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.010> something

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
works that they see and that's something

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
works that they see and that's something
which<00:02:24.430> Blake<00:02:24.730> really<00:02:25.450> wanted<00:02:25.780> from<00:02:25.840> his

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
which Blake really wanted from his

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.630 
which Blake really wanted from his
public<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.430> perfect

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
public so I think it's the perfect

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
public so I think it's the perfect
setting<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.390> exhibition<00:02:28.959> actually

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.910 

well<00:02:33.340> for<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.610> British<00:02:34.290> Blake's<00:02:35.290> always<00:02:35.620> been

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
well for the British Blake's always been

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.910 
well for the British Blake's always been
something<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.690> romantic<00:02:37.690> isolated<00:02:38.560> figure

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
something of a romantic isolated figure

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
something of a romantic isolated figure
and<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.519> think<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.819> myth<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.269> grown<00:02:40.450> up

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
and I think this myth has grown up

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.890 
and I think this myth has grown up
around<00:02:40.720> him<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.860> ideal<00:02:42.599> genius<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
around him of the ideal genius the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.990 
around him of the ideal genius the
perfect<00:02:44.319> artist<00:02:44.739> who<00:02:44.920> struggled<00:02:45.430> against<00:02:45.849> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
perfect artist who struggled against the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.630 
perfect artist who struggled against the
Society<00:02:46.599> of<00:02:46.629> his<00:02:46.810> own<00:02:46.930> times<00:02:47.459> politically<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
Society of his own times politically and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.509 
Society of his own times politically and
artistically<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.500> really<00:02:50.830> kind<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.310> set

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
artistically and this really kind of set

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.369 
artistically and this really kind of set
in<00:02:51.640> stone<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.239> idea<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> artist<00:02:53.170> as

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
in stone the idea of the artist as

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.410 
in stone the idea of the artist as
somebody<00:02:53.709> who<00:02:53.890> challenges<00:02:54.459> preconceptions

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
somebody who challenges preconceptions

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.740 
somebody who challenges preconceptions
and<00:02:55.660> too<00:02:56.379> introduces<00:02:57.340> something<00:02:57.549> new<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.330> has

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and too introduces something new and has

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.420 
and too introduces something new and has
to<00:02:58.870> follow<00:02:59.019> their<00:02:59.290> own<00:02:59.410> imagination<00:03:00.250> to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
to follow their own imagination to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.100 
to follow their own imagination to
really<00:03:00.730> act<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.120> themselves<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.080> be

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
really act for themselves and to be

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.930 
really act for themselves and to be
independent<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.010> it's<00:03:03.430> something<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.760> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
independent and it's something that you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.490 
independent and it's something that you
can<00:03:04.090> see<00:03:04.299> particularly<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.870> these<00:03:05.049> rooms<00:03:05.380> that

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
can see particularly in these rooms that

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.190 
can see particularly in these rooms that
deal<00:03:05.769> with<00:03:06.010> his<00:03:06.250> legacy<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:07.390> other<00:03:07.510> artists

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
deal with his legacy for other artists

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.930 
deal with his legacy for other artists
the<00:03:08.380> way<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.829> which<00:03:08.950> they<00:03:09.130> responded<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.730> his

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the way in which they responded to his

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.210 
the way in which they responded to his
art<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> sort<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.660> took<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.470> call<00:03:11.890> if<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
art and sort of took that call if you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.839 
art and sort of took that call if you
like<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:13.390> true<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.720> themselves<00:03:14.640> but<00:03:15.640> Blake

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
like to be true to themselves but Blake

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.610 
like to be true to themselves but Blake
himself<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.420> actually<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.810> think<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.290> much<00:03:17.470> more

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
himself is actually I think a much more

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.199 
himself is actually I think a much more
complicated<00:03:18.010> figure<00:03:18.579> than<00:03:18.700> often<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.180> think

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
complicated figure than often we think

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.600 
complicated figure than often we think
because<00:03:19.840> he<00:03:20.200> was<00:03:20.349> very<00:03:20.379> keen<00:03:20.829> actually<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
because he was very keen actually to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.580 
because he was very keen actually to
communicate<00:03:22.150> directly<00:03:22.450> with<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.959> public<00:03:23.170> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
communicate directly with the public and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.009 
communicate directly with the public and
he<00:03:24.099> staged<00:03:24.400> his<00:03:24.549> own<00:03:24.730> exhibition<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.629> he

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
he staged his own exhibition and he

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.740 
he staged his own exhibition and he
wanted<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.500> make<00:03:26.680> Grands<00:03:27.340> heroic<00:03:28.000> monuments

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
wanted to make Grands heroic monuments

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.869 
wanted to make Grands heroic monuments
for<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.049> nation<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.099> actually<00:03:30.459> he<00:03:30.579> didn't

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
for the nation and so actually he didn't

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.180 
for the nation and so actually he didn't
really<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.450> himself<00:03:31.629> as<00:03:31.959> outside<00:03:32.470> society

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
really see himself as outside society

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.250 
really see himself as outside society
exactly<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.239> somebody<00:03:34.569> who<00:03:34.690> wanted<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.079> be
