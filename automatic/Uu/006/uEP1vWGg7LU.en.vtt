hi<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.930> Sam<00:00:07.200> from<00:00:07.649> Sesame<00:00:08.099> code<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.700> UK<00:00:09.000> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
hi I'm Sam from Sesame code at UK and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
hi I'm Sam from Sesame code at UK and
I'm<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> teach<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.200> some<00:00:10.440> origami

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
I'm going to teach you some origami

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.000 
I'm going to teach you some origami
models<00:00:14.240> hi<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> make<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> paper

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
models hi this is how you make a paper

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.370 
models hi this is how you make a paper
snowflake<00:00:20.240> okay<00:00:21.240> there's<00:00:21.480> also<00:00:21.630> called<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
snowflake okay there's also called a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.519 
snowflake okay there's also called a
eight<00:00:23.369> point<00:00:23.730> star<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> transforming<00:00:25.260> stock

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
eight point star or a transforming stock

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.640 
eight point star or a transforming stock
and<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.430> modular<00:00:27.060> origami<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.810> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and is actually modular origami and this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.299 
and is actually modular origami and this
means<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:30.170> multiple<00:00:31.309> identical

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
means that we make multiple identical

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
means that we make multiple identical
pieces<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.059> build<00:00:33.480> them<00:00:33.600> together<00:00:34.010> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
pieces and then build them together so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.569 
pieces and then build them together so
first<00:00:35.370> we're<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.570> piece<00:00:37.579> fold

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
first we're going to make one piece fold

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
first we're going to make one piece fold
it<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.760> half<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.020> 90<00:00:40.260> degrees<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.620> told

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it in half so it's 90 degrees and told

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
it in half so it's 90 degrees and told
you<00:00:40.860> again<00:00:41.390> I've<00:00:42.390> knit<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.170> fold<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you again I've knit and then fold the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
you again I've knit and then fold the
diagonals<00:00:47.090> back<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
diagonals back up and now we're going to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.350 
diagonals back up and now we're going to
fold<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.949> corner<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> middle<00:00:56.360> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
fold this corner into the middle and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.979 
fold this corner into the middle and
again<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.050> side<00:01:02.660> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> fold<00:01:03.899> them

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
again on this side going to fold them

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.289 
again on this side going to fold them
over<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.350> half<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:08.119> what<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.210> going

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
over one half now and what we're going

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.109 
over one half now and what we're going
to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.840> open<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.650> pot<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.820> pour

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to do is just open this pot up and pour

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.700 
to do is just open this pot up and pour
this<00:01:12.270> triangular<00:01:13.110> section<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.770> yourself

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.850 

so<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.580> get<00:01:18.760> something<00:01:19.510> like<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.080> this

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
so you get something like this and this

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.240 
so you get something like this and this
is<00:01:21.010> one<00:01:21.280> piece<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.900> we<00:01:23.049> make<00:01:23.229> eight<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.130> these

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
is one piece now we make eight of these

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.640 
is one piece now we make eight of these
pieces<00:01:24.549> here's<00:01:25.210> another<00:01:25.270> one<00:01:25.630> we're<00:01:26.440> going<00:01:26.530> to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
pieces here's another one we're going to

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.830 
pieces here's another one we're going to
assemble<00:01:27.280> them<00:01:27.550> together<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:28.420> build<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.690> model

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
assemble them together to build a model

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040 
assemble them together to build a model
so<00:01:29.800> first<00:01:30.159> what<00:01:31.060> we're<00:01:31.180> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.360> do<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:31.720> put

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
so first what we're going to do is put

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.859 
so first what we're going to do is put
this<00:01:32.409> triangle<00:01:32.830> into<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.970> part<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.720> why

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
this triangle into this part of the why

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.840 
this triangle into this part of the why
of<00:01:35.110> yeah<00:01:35.860> just<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:39.250> see<00:01:39.460> these<00:01:39.610> two

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
of yeah just like that you see these two

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.870 
of yeah just like that you see these two
slap<00:01:40.300> sir<00:01:40.540> I'm<00:01:41.470> going<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> tuck<00:01:41.860> these<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.759> on

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
slap sir I'm going to tuck these in on

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.680 
slap sir I'm going to tuck these in on
each<00:01:42.909> other<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.610> joins<00:01:45.610> up<00:01:45.880> with<00:01:45.909> devil

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
each other so it joins up with devil

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.169 
each other so it joins up with devil
piece<00:01:46.869> like<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.060> assembling<00:01:52.060> together

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
piece like so so you assembling together

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.090 
piece like so so you assembling together
now<00:01:52.810> you'll<00:01:52.990> notice<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.289> thief<00:01:53.710> pieces

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
now you'll notice that thief pieces

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.050 
now you'll notice that thief pieces
final<00:01:54.399> slide<00:01:54.820> in<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.780> or<00:01:56.590> each<00:01:56.740> other<00:01:57.060> now

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
final slide in and out or each other now

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
final slide in and out or each other now
if<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.270> make<00:01:58.479> several<00:01:58.929> model<00:01:59.350> more<00:01:59.800> of<00:01:59.890> these

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
if you make several model more of these

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.940 
if you make several model more of these
and<00:02:00.280> combine<00:02:01.240> them<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:02.020> slowly<00:02:02.350> form<00:02:02.740> this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and combine them you slowly form this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.020 
and combine them you slowly form this
kind<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.310> circle<00:02:03.880> shape<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:04.960> finish<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.649> off

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
kind of circle shape so to finish it off

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.670 
kind of circle shape so to finish it off
we<00:02:07.030> will<00:02:09.660> assemble<00:02:10.660> them<00:02:10.899> together<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.530> we're

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
we will assemble them together so we're

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.330 
we will assemble them together so we're
going<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.860> push<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.280> piece<00:02:12.519> into<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:18.330> then

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
going to push this piece into here then

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.460 
going to push this piece into here then
push<00:02:21.340> those<00:02:21.610> triangular<00:02:22.510> bits<00:02:22.690> into<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:25.470> top

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
push those triangular bits into that top

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
push those triangular bits into that top
of<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.739> why

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.910 

and<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.200> final<00:02:45.380> step<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.580> push<00:02:47.920> remaining

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
and the final step is to push remaining

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.890 
and the final step is to push remaining
piece<00:02:49.130> internet<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.330> part<00:02:53.600> would<00:02:53.750> get<00:02:53.870> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
piece internet and this part would get a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.470 
piece internet and this part would get a
little<00:02:54.200> bit<00:02:54.290> more<00:02:54.410> tricky<00:02:54.560> yet<00:02:54.980> have<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.580> force

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
little bit more tricky yet have to force

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:11.350 
little bit more tricky yet have to force
these<00:02:56.780> flaps<00:02:57.170> inside<00:03:01.930> he's<00:03:02.930> open<00:03:03.350> gently<00:03:10.360> he's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
these flaps inside he's open gently he's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.210 
these flaps inside he's open gently he's
open<00:03:11.750> gently<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.440> push<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.830> triangle

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
open gently and push the triangle

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.320 
open gently and push the triangle
slapping<00:03:14.680> ok<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.430> far<00:03:16.640> you're<00:03:16.850> just<00:03:17.090> kind<00:03:17.269> of

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
slapping ok so far you're just kind of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.890 
slapping ok so far you're just kind of
hoe<00:03:18.319> shape<00:03:18.590> now<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.910> make<00:03:20.060> into<00:03:20.330> start<00:03:20.600> all<00:03:20.780> you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
hoe shape now to make into start all you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.920 
hoe shape now to make into start all you
can<00:03:21.019> do<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.680> push<00:03:22.459> these<00:03:22.730> parts<00:03:23.180> gently

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
can do is to push these parts gently

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.640 
can do is to push these parts gently
into<00:03:24.200> each<00:03:24.319> other<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.380> will<00:03:27.470> start

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
into each other and it will start

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.979 
into each other and it will start
forming<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.250> shape<00:03:28.280> whoops<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.950> start<00:03:31.989> if

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
forming the shape whoops of the start if

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.840 
forming the shape whoops of the start if
any<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.410> flaps<00:03:33.650> pop<00:03:33.950> open<00:03:34.160> just<00:03:34.519> push<00:03:34.730> them

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
any of the flaps pop open just push them

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:45.270 
any of the flaps pop open just push them
back<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:40.030> ok<00:03:42.070> eventually<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:44.480> will<00:03:44.600> form<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
back in ok eventually it will form the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:04:05.870 
back in ok eventually it will form the
start<00:03:46.630> that's<00:03:47.630> my<00:03:47.810> thing

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.050 

okay<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.300> there's<00:04:07.570> just<00:04:07.690> no<00:04:07.840> fight
