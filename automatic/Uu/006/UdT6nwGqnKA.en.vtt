00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.120 
graphic sucks since runescape is made by
Java<00:02:07.030> systems<00:02:07.599> the<00:02:07.959> game<00:02:08.140> really<00:02:08.440> has<00:02:08.679> no<00:02:08.890> good

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
Java systems the game really has no good

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.150 
Java systems the game really has no good
graphics<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.810> graphics<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.440> give<00:02:11.590> runescape

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
graphics so on graphics I give runescape

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370 
graphics so on graphics I give runescape
the<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.760> good<00:02:13.209> thing<00:02:13.450> about<00:02:13.569> runescape<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the one a good thing about runescape is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.130 
the one a good thing about runescape is
its<00:02:14.530> PK<00:02:14.950> skills<00:02:15.329> their<00:02:16.329> skills<00:02:16.720> are<00:02:16.930> nowhere

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
its PK skills their skills are nowhere

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.289 
its PK skills their skills are nowhere
near<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.620> world<00:02:17.829> of<00:02:18.040> warcraft<00:02:18.579> but<00:02:19.150> they're

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
near a world of warcraft but they're

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.140 
near a world of warcraft but they're
pretty<00:02:19.510> good<00:02:19.810> since<00:02:20.049> it's<00:02:20.260> free<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:21.090> PK<00:02:22.090> skills

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
pretty good since it's free on PK skills

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.470 
pretty good since it's free on PK skills
i<00:02:22.630> give<00:02:22.780> run<00:02:23.019> scape<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.410> seven<00:02:23.739> but<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.970> flaw<00:02:25.239> is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
i give run scape a seven but one flaw is

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.090 
i give run scape a seven but one flaw is
that<00:02:25.510> when<00:02:25.870> fighting<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:26.380> stay<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.799> one<00:02:27.069> spot

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
that when fighting you stay in one spot

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.000 
that when fighting you stay in one spot
last<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.299> not<00:02:28.420> least<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:29.049> thing<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.739> i<00:02:29.769> hate

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
last but not least one thing that i hate

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.740 
last but not least one thing that i hate
about<00:02:30.069> runescape<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.209> order<00:02:31.329> to<00:02:31.569> make

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
about runescape is that in order to make

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.479 
about runescape is that in order to make
a<00:02:31.780> new<00:02:32.049> account<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.950> go<00:02:33.160> through<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
a new account you have to go through a

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.180 
a new account you have to go through a
tutorial<00:02:33.910> i<00:02:34.329> think<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.709> should<00:02:35.859> have<00:02:36.069> a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
tutorial i think that you should have a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.890 
tutorial i think that you should have a
choose<00:02:36.459> whether<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> want<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.269> go<00:02:37.420> through<00:02:37.780> it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
choose whether you want to go through it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.129 
choose whether you want to go through it
or<00:02:38.049> not<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:39.489> why<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.850> giving<00:02:40.269> tutorial<00:02:40.840> 1

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
or not so that's why I giving tutorial 1

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.210 
or not so that's why I giving tutorial 1
overall<00:02:41.829> i<00:02:41.980> give<00:02:42.160> runescape<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.000> 70<00:02:43.389> out<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.540> 100

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
overall i give runescape a 70 out of 100

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.640 
overall i give runescape a 70 out of 100
meaning<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.489> an<00:02:45.609> okay<00:02:45.970> game<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> it's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
meaning that it's an okay game but it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.280 
meaning that it's an okay game but it's
not<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.980> best<00:02:48.160> game<00:02:48.459> out<00:02:48.670> there<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:50.049> has

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
not the best game out there and this has

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.480 
not the best game out there and this has
been<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.470> report<00:02:50.920> by<00:02:51.100> game<00:02:51.400> reports<00:02:51.910> production
