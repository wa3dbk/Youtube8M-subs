00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.999 
tablets now we have no paper charts we
have<00:00:22.630> all<00:00:22.869> this<00:00:23.019> information<00:00:23.679> on<00:00:23.830> the

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
have all this information on the

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.070 
have all this information on the
electronic<00:00:24.519> flight<00:00:24.699> bag<00:00:24.970> this<00:00:25.269> is<00:00:25.420> around<00:00:25.599> 15

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
electronic flight bag this is around 15

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.230 
electronic flight bag this is around 15
to<00:00:26.199> 20<00:00:26.529> kilograms<00:00:27.039> that<00:00:27.339> we<00:00:27.490> had<00:00:27.669> to<00:00:27.820> transport

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
to 20 kilograms that we had to transport

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.450 
to 20 kilograms that we had to transport
now<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:28.839> can<00:00:29.169> get<00:00:29.320> rid<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.529> that<00:00:29.830> which<00:00:30.160> saves

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
now we can get rid of that which saves

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.170 
now we can get rid of that which saves
fuel<00:00:30.669> and<00:00:30.999> saves<00:00:31.570> cost<00:00:32.010> when<00:00:33.010> we<00:00:33.160> designed<00:00:33.879> the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
fuel and saves cost when we designed the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.959 
fuel and saves cost when we designed the
applications<00:00:34.899> on<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.200> surface<00:00:35.829> pro<00:00:36.039> 3<00:00:36.070> we

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
applications on a surface pro 3 we

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.880 
applications on a surface pro 3 we
really<00:00:37.210> wanted<00:00:37.539> to<00:00:37.600> take<00:00:37.930> advantage<00:00:38.590> of<00:00:38.739> the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
really wanted to take advantage of the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.920 
really wanted to take advantage of the
touch<00:00:39.100> capabilities<00:00:39.879> of<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.539> surface<00:00:40.899> pro

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
touch capabilities of the surface pro

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.229 
touch capabilities of the surface pro
tablet<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.739> that's<00:00:42.250> why<00:00:42.430> we<00:00:42.640> designed<00:00:43.059> all

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
tablet and that's why we designed all

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.840 
tablet and that's why we designed all
our<00:00:43.600> applications<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.440> way<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:45.039> make<00:00:45.550> their

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
our applications in a way to make their

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.700 
our applications in a way to make their
flights<00:00:46.390> more<00:00:46.840> efficient<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.500> more<00:00:47.739> safe<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
flights more efficient and more safe in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
our dispatch we have several oakland

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.020 
our dispatch we have several oakland
stations<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.289> when<00:00:54.010> they<00:00:54.160> check<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.609> for<00:00:54.969> a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
tablet in all phases of flight we have

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.000 
tablet in all phases of flight we have
quicker<00:01:40.060> access<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.990> all<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.380> informations

quicker access to all the informations

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.400 
quicker access to all the informations
in<00:01:42.250> flight<00:01:42.490> especially<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.780> route<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:44.230> you

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
in flight especially in route if you

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.830 
in flight especially in route if you
need<00:01:44.650> any<00:01:45.040> information<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.760> an<00:01:45.910> airport<00:01:46.390> which

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
need any information of an airport which

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.170 
need any information of an airport which
just<00:01:47.080> were<00:01:47.320> flying<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:48.340> really<00:01:48.670> gives<00:01:48.910> them

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
just were flying that really gives them

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.240 
just were flying that really gives them
an<00:01:49.360> enhancement<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.230> their<00:01:50.410> flight<00:01:50.650> operation

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
an enhancement of their flight operation

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.490 
an enhancement of their flight operation
experience<00:01:51.730> and<00:01:51.940> increases<00:01:52.930> safety<00:01:53.410> and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
experience and increases safety and

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.930 
experience and increases safety and
efficiency<00:01:53.890> for<00:01:54.280> all<00:01:54.400> our<00:01:54.610> flights<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:56.940> think

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
efficiency for all our flights I think

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.510 
efficiency for all our flights I think
that<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.390> Microsoft<00:01:58.780> Surface<00:01:58.960> pro<00:01:59.170> 3<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.830> a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
that the Microsoft Surface pro 3 is a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.910 
that the Microsoft Surface pro 3 is a
powerful<00:02:00.910> tool<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.630> combines<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.380> computing

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
powerful tool it combines the computing
