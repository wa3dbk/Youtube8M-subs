gonna<00:01:44.630> go<00:01:44.870> ahead<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.200> twist<00:01:45.710> with<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:45.950> motion

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
gonna go ahead and twist with the motion

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.360 
gonna go ahead and twist with the motion
shine<00:01:46.940> enhancing<00:01:47.510> pomade<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.130> just

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
shine enhancing pomade so this is just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.610 
shine enhancing pomade so this is just
again<00:01:49.880> really<00:01:50.390> great<00:01:50.720> for<00:01:50.990> shine<00:01:51.290> and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
again really great for shine and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.860 
again really great for shine and
moisture<00:01:52.159> which<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.090> important<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.720> me

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
moisture which is very important to me

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.830 
moisture which is very important to me
in<00:01:54.049> this<00:01:54.620> style<00:01:54.920> now<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.659> my

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
in this style now as you can see here my

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.800 
in this style now as you can see here my
twists<00:01:57.200> are<00:01:57.409> pretty<00:01:57.799> small<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.700> honestly<00:01:59.630> a

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
twists are pretty small and honestly a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.719 
twists are pretty small and honestly a
lot<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> people<00:02:00.620> do<00:02:00.770> their<00:02:00.950> twists<00:02:01.370> even

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
lot of people do their twists even

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.420 
lot of people do their twists even
smaller<00:02:02.240> than<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:02.900> girl<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.650> did<00:02:04.100> not

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
smaller than this but girl I did not

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
smaller than this but girl I did not
have<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.820> patience<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.360> do<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.720> any<00:02:05.930> smaller

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
have the patience to do it any smaller

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:16.559 
have the patience to do it any smaller
so<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.070> size<00:02:07.400> really<00:02:07.820> worked<00:02:08.179> for<00:02:08.420> me

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.809 

so<00:02:17.349> I'm<00:02:17.409> pretty<00:02:17.650> much<00:02:17.799> done<00:02:18.189> with<00:02:18.219> my<00:02:18.549> first

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
so I'm pretty much done with my first

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
so I'm pretty much done with my first
two<00:02:19.000> twists<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.010> ends

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
two twists and as you can see the ends

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.369 
two twists and as you can see the ends
are<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.519> little<00:02:21.760> bit<00:02:22.000> fuzzy<00:02:22.269> which<00:02:22.689> I<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:22.930> not

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
are a little bit fuzzy which I do not

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.750 
are a little bit fuzzy which I do not
like<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.890> I'm<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.099> going<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> spray<00:02:24.579> them

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
like so I'm just going to spray them

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.910 
like so I'm just going to spray them
with<00:02:24.909> a<00:02:24.939> little<00:02:25.180> bit<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.510> extra<00:02:25.870> water<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.769> get

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
with a little bit of extra water to get

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.399 
with a little bit of extra water to get
them<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.280> curl<00:02:27.549> up<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.030> sometimes<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:29.079> even

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
them to curl up and sometimes I even

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.289 
them to curl up and sometimes I even
like<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.650> add<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> little<00:02:30.519> bit<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
like to add a little bit more of the

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.599 
like to add a little bit more of the
shine<00:02:31.599> enhancing<00:02:32.170> pomade<00:02:32.439> just<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:33.579> it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
shine enhancing pomade just to make it

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.940 
shine enhancing pomade just to make it
curl<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.359> and<00:02:34.599> just<00:02:34.780> really<00:02:35.200> smooth<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.799> out

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
curl up and just really smooth it out

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.039 
curl up and just really smooth it out
because<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.459> ends<00:02:36.879> are<00:02:37.030> really<00:02:37.480> important

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
because the ends are really important

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.690 
because the ends are really important
for<00:02:38.109> this<00:02:38.349> step<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:38.920> want<00:02:39.189> to<00:02:39.310> keep<00:02:39.459> them

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
for this step and you want to keep them

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.670 
for this step and you want to keep them
moisturized<00:02:40.120> while<00:02:40.780> you're<00:02:40.989> protecting<00:02:41.530> them

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
moisturized while you're protecting them

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.679 
moisturized while you're protecting them
so<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:42.489> I'm<00:02:42.639> just<00:02:42.819> gonna<00:02:42.909> do<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.299> same<00:02:43.629> thing

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
so now I'm just gonna do the same thing

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.959 
so now I'm just gonna do the same thing
on<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.500> other<00:02:44.530> section<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.280> hair<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.879> have

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
on the other section of hair and I have

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.539 
on the other section of hair and I have

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
pretty much the same size as the other

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.500 
pretty much the same size as the other
one<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.829> I'm<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.489> wetting<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.000> ends<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
one and I'm just wetting the ends a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
one and I'm just wetting the ends a
little<00:02:52.810> bit<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.139> advance<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.859> then<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.099> going

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
little bit in advance and then I'm going

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460 
little bit in advance and then I'm going
to<00:02:54.310> get<00:02:54.489> ready<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.879> start<00:02:54.909> twisting<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:56.139> same

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
to get ready to start twisting the same

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.409 
to get ready to start twisting the same
exact<00:02:56.859> way<00:02:57.129> using<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> motion<00:02:57.970> shine

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
exact way using the motion shine

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
so I'm done with the first section and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.539 
so I'm done with the first section and
this<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.900> what<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.200> looks<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.680> nice<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
see once you give the twist a little bit

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.809 
see once you give the twist a little bit
of<00:03:33.080> time<00:03:33.379> they<00:03:33.709> plump<00:03:34.129> it<00:03:34.310> up<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.670> they're<00:03:34.790> not

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
of time they plump it up and they're not

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.140

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
so stringy and thin like they look when

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.449 
so stringy and thin like they look when
you<00:03:38.269> first<00:03:38.299> twist<00:03:38.900> them<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.799> now<00:03:40.129> I'm<00:03:40.250> going<00:03:40.400> to

going<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.129> wet<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.519> just<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:56.030> tiny<00:03:56.329> bit<00:03:56.720> just<00:03:56.780> to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
going to wet it just a tiny bit just to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.740 
going to wet it just a tiny bit just to
make<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.470> pliable<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.370> just<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.030> get<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.329> ends

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
make it pliable and just to get the ends

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.110 
make it pliable and just to get the ends
to<00:03:59.870> properly<00:04:00.260> curl<00:04:00.650> up<00:04:00.890> then<00:04:01.609> apply<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> little

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
to properly curl up then apply a little

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.240 
to properly curl up then apply a little
bit<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.810> motion<00:04:03.260> shine<00:04:03.530> enhancing<00:04:03.980> pomade

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
bit of the motion shine enhancing pomade

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.300 
bit of the motion shine enhancing pomade
to<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.819> entire<00:04:05.239> section<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.230> then<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.099> can

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
to the entire section and then you can

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.099 
to the entire section and then you can
go<00:04:07.459> ahead<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.849> start<00:04:08.120> twisting<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.930> make

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
go ahead and start twisting and make

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.960 
go ahead and start twisting and make
sure<00:04:09.379> that<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.709> wet<00:04:09.950> your<00:04:10.129> ends<00:04:10.579> curl<00:04:10.819> them

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
sure that you wet your ends curl them

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.569 
sure that you wet your ends curl them
around<00:04:11.060> your<00:04:11.390> finger<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.049> even<00:04:12.769> put<00:04:13.099> apply<00:04:13.549> a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
around your finger and even put apply a

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.430 
around your finger and even put apply a
little<00:04:13.970> bit<00:04:14.090> more<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.780> shine<00:04:15.019> enhancing

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
little bit more of the shine enhancing

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.920 
little bit more of the shine enhancing
pomade<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.579> need<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.970> get<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.419> curl<00:04:17.690> up

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
pomade if you need to get it to curl up

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.469 
pomade if you need to get it to curl up
so<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.650> entire<00:04:18.979> back<00:04:19.370> section<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.000> finished

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
so the entire back section is finished

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.840 
so the entire back section is finished
after<00:04:20.930> what<00:04:21.109> seems<00:04:21.440> like<00:04:21.709> forever<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.610> I'm

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850

not<00:04:23.090> going<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> lie<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:24.110> style<00:04:24.440> does<00:04:24.770> take<00:04:25.039> a

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
not going to lie this style does take a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.730 
not going to lie this style does take a
couple<00:04:25.370> hours<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.180> be<00:04:26.479> ready<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.169> patient

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
couple hours so be ready to be patient

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.490 
couple hours so be ready to be patient
but<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.310> end<00:04:28.610> result<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.630> nice<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.110> as

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
but the end result is really nice and as

you can see my twists are already

and shiny and it better be after all of
that<00:04:41.479> time<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.169> took<00:04:42.349> to<00:04:42.530> do<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:43.250> it's

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
that time that it took to do but it's

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.219

also<00:04:43.580> nice<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.300> stretched<00:04:44.630> out<00:04:44.840> which<00:04:45.080> is

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
also nice and stretched out which is

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.529 
also nice and stretched out which is
exactly<00:04:45.380> what<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.160> was<00:04:46.370> going<00:04:46.669> for<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.450> if

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
exactly what I was going for so if

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.390 
exactly what I was going for so if
you're<00:04:47.690> wondering<00:04:47.990> why<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.590> have<00:04:48.919> this<00:04:49.099> hair

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
you're wondering why I have this hair

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.670 
you're wondering why I have this hair
sectioned<00:04:49.940> off<00:04:50.060> at<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.539> front<00:04:50.840> it's<00:04:51.169> because

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
sectioned off at the front it's because

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.379 
sectioned off at the front it's because
I've<00:04:51.860> been<00:04:52.130> experiencing<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.880> little<00:04:53.030> bit<00:04:53.270> of

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
I've been experiencing a little bit of

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.390 
I've been experiencing a little bit of
breakage<00:04:53.960> towards<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.650> front<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:54.919> my<00:04:55.099> hair

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
breakage towards the front of my hair

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.790 
breakage towards the front of my hair
basically<00:04:56.000> at<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.389> edges<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.380> think<00:04:57.650> it's

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
basically at the edges and I think it's

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.680 
basically at the edges and I think it's
because<00:04:58.099> of<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.460> pups<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:59.180> too<00:04:59.479> much

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
because of the pups and too much

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.710 
because of the pups and too much
brushing<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.470> gel<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.700> really<00:05:02.090> just<00:05:02.120> wanted

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
brushing and gel so I really just wanted

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.750 
brushing and gel so I really just wanted
to<00:05:02.750> twist<00:05:03.620> up<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.860> front<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.370> little<00:05:04.520> bit

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
to twist up the front a little bit

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.279 
to twist up the front a little bit
differently<00:05:05.240> so<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.599> I<00:05:05.690> don't<00:05:06.020> have<00:05:06.139> to

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
differently so that I don't have to

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.219 
differently so that I don't have to
manipulate<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.070> at<00:05:07.160> all<00:05:07.430> during<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.360> week<00:05:08.539> so

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
manipulate it at all during the week so

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.430 
manipulate it at all during the week so
I<00:05:09.500> only<00:05:09.740> parted<00:05:10.220> off<00:05:10.340> about<00:05:10.669> one<00:05:11.120> inch<00:05:11.419> of<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
I only parted off about one inch of the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.020 
I only parted off about one inch of the
hair<00:05:12.650> that's<00:05:12.830> framing<00:05:13.250> my<00:05:13.370> face<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.820> I'm<00:05:13.880> just

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
hair that's framing my face and I'm just

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.089 
hair that's framing my face and I'm just
going<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.300> go<00:05:14.450> ahead<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.840> flat<00:05:15.169> twist<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:15.770> back

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
going to go ahead and flat twist it back

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.730 
going to go ahead and flat twist it back
and<00:05:16.460> then<00:05:16.970> twist<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.810> rest<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.320> hair<00:05:18.530> all

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
and then twist the rest of the hair all

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.800 
and then twist the rest of the hair all
the<00:05:18.770> way<00:05:18.949> down<00:05:19.039> to<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.550> ends<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.060> they're<00:05:20.599> just

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
the way down to the ends so they're just

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.839 
the way down to the ends so they're just
really<00:05:21.050> simple<00:05:21.560> flat<00:05:21.889> twists<00:05:22.280> it's<00:05:22.490> really

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
really simple flat twists it's really

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.180 
really simple flat twists it's really
short<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.330> easy<00:05:23.660> but<00:05:24.320> if<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.530> can't<00:05:24.830> do<00:05:25.039> this

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
short and easy but if you can't do this

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.950 
short and easy but if you can't do this
you<00:05:25.400> can<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.789> course<00:05:26.120> just<00:05:26.180> twist<00:05:26.630> up<00:05:26.780> your

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
you can of course just twist up your

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.560 
you can of course just twist up your
whole<00:05:27.169> head<00:05:27.380> but<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.160> wanted<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.580> flats

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
whole head but I just wanted to flats

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.330 
whole head but I just wanted to flats
with<00:05:29.810> some<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.050> my<00:05:30.380> edges<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.010> they're<00:05:31.310> a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
with some of my edges so that they're a

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.670
