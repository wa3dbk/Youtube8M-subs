00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this plane when it was first introduced

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.070 
this plane when it was first introduced
in<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> mean<00:00:30.269> when<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.869> would

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
in like when I mean when I first would

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920 
in like when I mean when I first would
explain<00:00:31.679> cuz<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.759> big<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.360> look<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.840> how

explain cuz it's so big just look at how
big<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.290> plane<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.079> size

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
big this plane is it is about the size

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.510 
big this plane is it is about the size
of<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.649> 18<00:00:38.070> 111<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:40.230> does<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.739> four<00:00:41.070> machine
