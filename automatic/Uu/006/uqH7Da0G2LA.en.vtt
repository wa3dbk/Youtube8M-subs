 What is the difference between a priest and a psychologist, and who could be more useful in the family - a priest or a psychologist? First of all, you need to agree on what the priest does and what the psychologist does. The functions are completely different, although, perhaps, outwardly, you can see something in common. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 First of all, the role of the priest in the most ideal variant of his appointment is to bring a person to God. If this really took place, then the person becomes safe, he is happy, that is, he receives the highest gift that can be received in this earthly life. He gets fellowship with God, and it fills him, and he is happy. How well a priest can do this, how well he does it - this is already an open question, this is already a private question. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Of course, if this took place, then the person (I stress once again) is safe. That is, if a person came to God, all his life difficulties go away, dissolve, because he lives an elevated spiritual life, his heart is in God. God is love. And he is safe. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 What does a psychologist do? A psychologist helps a person to solve his or her life difficulties. We do not even say the word "problem". It is considered incorrect to work with the client to say “problem”. Solutions to these life difficulties can be different, the causes of these life difficulties can be very, very different. For example, some negative childish impressions, some internal or external conflicts of psychotrauma, lack of ability to be in society, and so on. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 All these things can be simply helped by a person to master, this can be taught in the same way as a person can be taught a foreign language. In the same way, one can psychologically help a person master some new behavior for him. For example, the ability to behave with the opposite sex in a family — to explain to an inexperienced person how to behave correctly, what a woman is, how a relationship between a man and a woman is built — this can be done by a psychologist. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And in this respect, the work of a psychologist is not as exalted, not as romantic as the work of a priest. But it is useful, and it is specific, and it responds to the specific request of a person. “I have a bad relationship with my wife. What should I do? ”-“ Tell me about your relationship, ”and the conversation begins, understanding is given. And then the work begins, the correction of this. That is, in a certain technique, in a certain psychological paradigm, a correction occurs, a correction of this material. Already through some 2, 3, 5 of our meetings, psychological sessions, the result is obtained, and the family life of the person improves. This is the work of a psychologist. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 To improve family life in a religious sense, what can a priest do? We are talking about a good result - not about manipulation, not about punishment, but about human development, that is, bringing a person to God. I am not sure that a priest for 2, 3, 5 meetings can lead a person to God and to that well-being, the triumph of his soul, if he himself does not know how, if he does not live the spiritual life, if he himself does not know the way to God. Or maybe he knows, but cannot convey this experience, teach another person. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 That is, the priest has a more elevated, more difficult task, perhaps even almost insoluble. But the psychologist works specifically: there is a certain paradigm, there is a technique, and you can work with it. There is, finally, a psychological experience. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So the question is: to whom to go - to the priest or to the psychologist? This question is very complex and very voluminous. It requires a small digression. The relationship of man to God is largely determined by the general psychological stock of man. Moreover, the attitude, say, to their parents is largely modeled by the relationship with God, with the church. Imagine a simple case - if a child was abused and mistreated by his father, and he was afraid of him, then the same attitude will be towards God. That is, a person will fear God and will fear a priest. And what's more, the relationship with the wife will be the same as the relationship with the mother, and so on. 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 In order to make a full-fledged and genuine relationship of a person with God, really, this is my opinion, the work of a psychologist is absolutely necessary. Why? Because it is necessary to remove all of these complexes, all of the stereotypes that have been taken from childhood, from some episodes of one’s life, all these psychological traumas, complexes that a person has collected in his life. He realizes all this and projects in his religious life. In order to optimize the path to God, it is necessary to remove this human garbage, this is all the imperfection and deformation of the human psyche, it is corrected quite easily in working with a psychologist. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And then such a person becomes, as it were, open for a full and deep spiritual communion and perception of God. If this is not done, then, as we have said, the whole religious life of such a person (humiliated, say, and hunted down by his parents or his father) will consist in that he will crawl on his knees in front of icons and ask God for forgiveness: Lord, forgive me a sinner, ”although he has no particular sins. Just a repetition, and maybe even an extension of some negative life experiences. 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 So who can help more? This must be decided by the couples themselves, whom they trust more, to whom they put great hope. You see, in the church with its present condition, you can get a good result related to retention in the family, but it will be a manipulation. And sooner or later, the manipulation will put pressure on the relationship, it will be uncomfortable, it will be hard, and you will want to jump out of this relationship. But it will be a relationship - a quick and clear result, everything is there: we live according to the canons; there are all the rules; we read prayers together; we sleep, we do not sleep - that says it all. Yes, this is a good family, everything is clear. 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 But the development of the soul, the development of the psyche, the living of your own life, the living of those resources that are given to you by God or nature (as you please) - this will not happen. Therefore, if this does not happen, I would still advise couples to turn to a psychologist and compare one with the other, which helps them better, which suits them better. And to be responsible for your own life - this is an indispensable condition.
