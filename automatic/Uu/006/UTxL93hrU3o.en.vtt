00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 we found in the construction of 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.710
 departments in theory 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.710
 you want we go 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.670
 sowing in some countries where the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 labor is in abundance can 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 represent up to a third of the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 construction well is important why 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 it is important to plan with the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 engineers with the subjects 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.700
 Structurists the planting of wood is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700
 the most common 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080
 it must be maintained 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.960
 I owe children 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 do not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.700
 at 18 days more and that potential is 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.950
 total 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 some the characteristics for the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.900
 simulation 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.970
 so many 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.820
 when erection or dismantling 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.979
 are made using exclusively hand 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.349
 of work the boards and other elements 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.720
 They must not exceed a weight of 35 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.880
 kilograms per operator when 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.980
 have equipment loading the forms 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.520
 They are of a size compatible with said 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520
 team 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.550
 the females must be hermetic for 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.099
 avoid leakage of paste or grout 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 the thickness of the walls and the rigidity 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.780
 of the molds must be such that the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.510
 fiber retains its shape and its position 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.040
 per share at the same time 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.080
 the forms are projected to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 dismantle easily for not 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.310
 damage the concrete during its removal 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.500
 in cases it deemed necessary 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 and the sequence and the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.270
 rapidity of casting to avoid or 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.580
 decrease eccentricity of the load 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.080
 due to placed concrete or equipment 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.990
 that is used for its placement 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
 during and after casting 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.190
 inspects the planting to detect 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.190
 reflexions tambourines or settlements or 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.590
 mismatches of the forms or the work 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.990
 false the structures must remain 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.640
 sown until the time 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.250
 the concrete reach in the resistance 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.250
 enough to support your own weight 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
 the structures must remain 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900
 sown until the time 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.760
 the concrete range of resistance 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.890
 enough to export your own weight 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.080
 the construction charges for 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.140
 sides of dallas and castles have 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.990
 minimum of 24-hour crops for 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.360
 some walls and sides across 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.420
 minimum of 36 hours for the three 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 Through reports go from 10 to 12 days and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.250
 for cantilevers from 14 to 16 days later 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.750
 of removing the crops are left 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.360
 struts that support the weight of the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.550
 concrete plus the live load considered 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.989
 during construction the props are 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.850
 they remove reach from the concrete their 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.860
 resistance of the project unless by 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.270
 the structural conditions are 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.830
 consider that you can withdraw with the 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.530
 concrete reach 90 percent of 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.370
 project resistance of 22 of 20 to 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.370
 22 days approximately
