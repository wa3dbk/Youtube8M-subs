some more sniper clips I'm like a pretty
good<00:01:51.810> sniper<00:01:52.049> when<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> comes<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
good sniper when it comes to getting a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
good sniper when it comes to getting a
lot<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.520> kills<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> row<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.509> I'm<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.960> good

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
at hitting clips I don't really know why

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
at hitting clips I don't really know why
maybe<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> trickshot<00:01:58.439> er<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.770> like

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
maybe it's the trickshot er that's like

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
maybe it's the trickshot er that's like
inside<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.119> can't<00:02:00.329> hit<00:02:00.509> sniper

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
