want to talk to you guys about the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.190 
want to talk to you guys about the
virtues<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.220> sleep<00:00:05.730> now<00:00:06.180> sleep<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.660> incredibly

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
virtues of sleep now sleep is incredibly

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.470 
virtues of sleep now sleep is incredibly
important<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.770> your<00:00:07.919> brain<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.400> there<00:00:09.389> are

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
important for your brain and there are

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450 
important for your brain and there are
two<00:00:09.630> major<00:00:09.809> reasons<00:00:10.080> why<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.280> one

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
two major reasons why that is so for one

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.240 
two major reasons why that is so for one
when<00:00:11.880> you're<00:00:12.000> sleeping<00:00:12.389> your<00:00:12.540> brain<00:00:12.840> is

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
when you're sleeping your brain is

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.499 
when you're sleeping your brain is
consolidating<00:00:14.250> memories<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.759> basically<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.330> way

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
consolidating memories a basically a way

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.820 
consolidating memories a basically a way
that<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> could<00:00:15.929> picture<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> by

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that you could picture this is by

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.310 
that you could picture this is by
thinking<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.640> desktop<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.480> your<00:00:18.510> Mac<00:00:18.930> for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
thinking of your desktop on your Mac for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
thinking of your desktop on your Mac for
example<00:00:19.350> you've<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> bunch<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> different

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
example you've got a bunch of different

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.370 
example you've got a bunch of different
windows<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.359> open<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.050> data

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
windows that are open and there's data

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
windows that are open and there's data
in<00:00:22.680> each<00:00:22.800> window<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.460> data<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.850> not

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
in each window that data is not

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.519 
in each window that data is not
necessarily<00:00:24.029> committed<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> hard<00:00:25.289> drive

necessarily committed to the hard drive

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
necessarily committed to the hard drive
it's<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.920> sort<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> sitting<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.880> those

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it's just sort of sitting there in those

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.670 
it's just sort of sitting there in those
open<00:00:27.420> application<00:00:27.990> basically<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.470> happens

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
open application basically what happens

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.929 
open application basically what happens
when<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> sleep<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.640> data

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
when you sleep is that that data

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.759 
when you sleep is that that data
actually<00:00:30.150> gets<00:00:30.539> saved<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> hard<00:00:31.619> drive

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
actually gets saved to the hard drive

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
actually gets saved to the hard drive
which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.460> hippocampus<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.329> memory

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
which is your hippocampus the memory

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.180 
which is your hippocampus the memory
center<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> brain<00:00:34.620> another<00:00:34.890> really

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
center of the brain another really

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
center of the brain another really
important<00:00:35.610> thing<00:00:35.640> that's<00:00:35.940> happening<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> your

important thing that's happening to your
brain<00:00:36.660> during<00:00:36.899> sleep<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.770> actually

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
brain during sleep is it's actually

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
brain during sleep is it's actually
cleaning<00:00:38.280> itself<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.820> they've<00:00:39.059> actually

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
cleaning itself out they've actually

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
cleaning itself out they've actually
coined<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.840> term<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> duct<00:00:41.010> system<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
coined a term for the duct system that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
coined a term for the duct system that
your<00:00:41.940> brain<00:00:42.149> uses<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.540> sort<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.870> clear<00:00:43.140> itself

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
your brain uses to sort of clear itself

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930 
your brain uses to sort of clear itself
of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> plaque<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.610> find<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of the plaque that they find that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.090 
of the plaque that they find that
accumulates<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.809> call<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> lymphatic

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
accumulates they call it the lymphatic

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
accumulates they call it the lymphatic
system<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.670> recently<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.120> fact<00:00:48.239> last<00:00:48.480> week<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
system very recently in fact last week a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
system very recently in fact last week a
study<00:00:49.230> came<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.590> suggesting<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> poor

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
study came out suggesting that poor

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
study came out suggesting that poor
sleep<00:00:51.210> may<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.539> linked<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> buildup<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> this

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
sleep may be linked to a buildup of this

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.290 
sleep may be linked to a buildup of this
toxic<00:00:53.190> protein<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> study<00:00:54.059> involved

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
toxic protein now the study involved

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
toxic protein now the study involved
normal<00:00:55.020> people<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> worse<00:00:55.860> their<00:00:56.070> sleep

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
normal people and the worse their sleep

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
normal people and the worse their sleep
was<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> worse<00:00:56.879> their<00:00:57.059> memories<00:00:57.390> perform<00:00:57.870> how

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
was the worse their memories perform how

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.420 
was the worse their memories perform how
cool<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> consider<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.280> you're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
cool is it to consider that when you're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
cool is it to consider that when you're
sleeping<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.969> brain<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.600> power

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
sleeping your brain is actually power

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
sleeping your brain is actually power
washing<00:01:01.260> itself<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> optimize<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
washing itself so how do you optimize it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
washing itself so how do you optimize it
well<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> really

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
well for what I think is really

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.630 
well for what I think is really
important<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> limit<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
important to limit your use of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
important to limit your use of
smartphones<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> technology<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.740> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
smartphones and technology in it you see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
smartphones and technology in it you see
when<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.280> smartphone<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.390> iPad

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
when you use your smartphone or an iPad

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
when you use your smartphone or an iPad
for<00:01:09.810> example<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> blue<00:01:10.799> light<00:01:11.010> emitted<00:01:11.460> from

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
for example the blue light emitted from

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070 
for example the blue light emitted from
those<00:01:11.790> screens<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.420> seemed<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.869> bigger

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
those screens that seemed to get bigger

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
those screens that seemed to get bigger
and<00:01:13.290> brighter<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:14.100> every<00:01:14.310> new<00:01:14.460> model

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and brighter with every new model

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
and brighter with every new model
subconsciously<00:01:15.720> makes<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.200> brain<00:01:16.439> think

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
subconsciously makes your brain think

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
subconsciously makes your brain think
that<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.310> daytime<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.909> brain<00:01:18.060> can't<00:01:18.299> tell

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that it's daytime your brain can't tell

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.490 
that it's daytime your brain can't tell
the<00:01:18.509> difference<00:01:18.780> between<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> blue<00:01:19.259> light

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the difference between the blue light

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
the difference between the blue light
emitted<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.009> smartphone<00:01:20.280> screen<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
emitted from a smartphone screen and the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210 
emitted from a smartphone screen and the
Sun<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.409> disrupts<00:01:22.860> melatonin

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
