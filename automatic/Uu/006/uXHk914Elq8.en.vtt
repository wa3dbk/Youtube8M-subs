00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
they're probably going to be in a large

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
they're probably going to be in a large
field<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:32.270> lava<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.130> look<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.579> look<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
field of lava and look for look for just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
field of lava and look for look for just
like<00:01:36.650> different<00:01:37.650> structures<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.189> over<00:01:38.430> here

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
like different structures like over here

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
like different structures like over here

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I found this bridge made out of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.030 
I found this bridge made out of
netherrack<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.000> odd-looking

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
netherrack which is this odd-looking

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
netherrack which is this odd-looking

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
bridge maybe that leads to something and

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
bridge maybe that leads to something and
it<00:01:52.079> did<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.740> led<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:54.259> humongous<00:01:55.259> uh<00:01:56.420> another

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it did it led to a humongous uh another

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
it did it led to a humongous uh another
fortress<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> came<00:01:59.280> across<00:01:59.579> this<00:02:00.000> bridge
