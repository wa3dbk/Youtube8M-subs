what<00:00:55.950> we<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.400> we<00:00:56.690> catch<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.930> salmon<00:00:58.110> that

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
what we do is we catch the salmon that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.920 
what we do is we catch the salmon that
we<00:00:58.739> eat<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.130> we<00:00:59.520> scrape<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.150> skins<00:01:00.510> they

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
we eat and we scrape the skins they

scrape all the skin and fat off of them

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820

so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.900> clean<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.559> I'm

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so you get them good and clean when I'm

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.520 
so you get them good and clean when I'm
washing<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.870> here's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> skin

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
washing up and then so here's a skin

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.420 
washing up and then so here's a skin
that's<00:01:07.800> been<00:01:08.100> washed<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:10.110> put<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> treatment

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that's been washed and I put a treatment

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
that's been washed and I put a treatment
on<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.660> make<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> soft<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on it that is going to make it soft and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.310 
on it that is going to make it soft and
then<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:16.640> manipulate<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
then all I do is I just manipulate this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
then all I do is I just manipulate this
for<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.530> five<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.070> eight<00:01:20.100> hours<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.060> then

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
for about five to eight hours and then

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.800 
for about five to eight hours and then
it<00:01:21.479> will<00:01:21.600> turn<00:01:21.810> into<00:01:23.960> fish<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.600> there's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it will turn into fish you know there's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.889 
it will turn into fish you know there's
kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> break<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.700> knowledge<00:01:30.450> about

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
kind of a break in this knowledge about

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.950 
kind of a break in this knowledge about
this<00:01:31.200> material<00:01:31.410> so<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.970> having<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> learn<00:01:33.720> all

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this material so on having to learn all

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.850 
this material so on having to learn all
my<00:01:34.110> own<00:01:34.550> I<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.570> test<00:01:36.810> everything<00:01:37.170> that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
my own I have to test everything that's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.210 
my own I have to test everything that's
the<00:01:38.190> only<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.259> ancestors<00:01:40.830> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the only way you know our ancestors the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
the only way you know our ancestors the
people<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> come<00:01:41.789> before<00:01:41.970> us<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.050> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
people that come before us do all the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
people that come before us do all the
testing<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.100> things<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.490> passed

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
testing and so when things are passed

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.230 
testing and so when things are passed
down<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.190> know<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.580> mom's<00:01:47.789> berry

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
down like I'm you know my mom's berry

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.779 
down like I'm you know my mom's berry
pie<00:01:48.509> recipe<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.740> already<00:01:50.130> been<00:01:50.280> tried<00:01:50.580> and

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
pie recipe it's already been tried and

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.730 
pie recipe it's already been tried and
true<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.300> tested<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.289> like<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
true and tested you do it just like that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.840 
true and tested you do it just like that
and<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.039> gonna<00:01:53.190> turn<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> same

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and you're gonna turn out with the same

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
and you're gonna turn out with the same
thing<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.770> recipes<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.950> passed<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.340> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
thing you know recipes are passed on in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.969 
thing you know recipes are passed on in
that<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.929> knowledge<00:01:57.929> is<00:01:58.080> passed<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.800> way

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that way knowledge is passed on that way

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
that way knowledge is passed on that way
family<00:01:59.670> histories<00:02:00.060> passed<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.780> way

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
family histories passed on in that way

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530 
family histories passed on in that way
so<00:02:01.530> we've<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:01.950> had<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> break<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.330> so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so we've just had a break in this and so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.370 
so we've just had a break in this and so
this<00:02:04.110> hasn't<00:02:04.560> been<00:02:04.740> passed<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.450> I've<00:02:07.080> had

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this hasn't been passed on so I've had

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.240 
this hasn't been passed on so I've had
to<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.160> figure<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.769> what<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:10.799> do<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to go and figure it all out what I do is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.900 
to go and figure it all out what I do is
I<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.579> salmon<00:02:12.390> skin<00:02:12.720> leather<00:02:13.560> process<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.700> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I do a salmon skin leather process and I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.840 
I do a salmon skin leather process and I
do<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> same<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.440> tan<00:02:16.980> do

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
do it the same way that you would tan do

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.319 
do it the same way that you would tan do
a<00:02:17.880> brain<00:02:18.180> tan<00:02:18.420> buckskin<00:02:19.940> which<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> an

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
a brain tan buckskin which is an

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.319 
a brain tan buckskin which is an
indigenous<00:02:21.780> method<00:02:22.470> from<00:02:23.340> many<00:02:23.850> parts<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
indigenous method from many parts of the

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.170 
indigenous method from many parts of the
United<00:02:24.660> States<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> world<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.880> tried

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
United States and the world so I tried

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.789 
United States and the world so I tried
it<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.420> fish<00:02:27.660> skin<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.440> worked<00:02:28.590> really

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
it on fish skin and it worked really

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.100 
it on fish skin and it worked really
well<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.400> I've<00:02:29.579> seen<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.209> collections<00:02:30.810> where

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
well and I've seen in collections where

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.690 
well and I've seen in collections where
it<00:02:31.290> looks<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.650> they've<00:02:31.829> made<00:02:32.040> fish<00:02:32.400> skin

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
it looks like they've made fish skin

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.200 
it looks like they've made fish skin
what<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> call<00:02:33.329> fish<00:02:33.450> thin<00:02:33.720> leather

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
what I call fish thin leather

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.030 
what I call fish thin leather
as<00:02:34.480> opposed<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.930> trying<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.500> people<00:02:35.920> would

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
as opposed to trying it people would

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.670 
as opposed to trying it people would
have<00:02:36.160> known<00:02:36.370> from<00:02:36.990> generations<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.200> wearing

fish skin clothing you know if one

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
fish skin clothing you know if one
worked<00:02:41.170> better<00:02:41.560> than<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.860> other<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.520> method

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
worked better than the other one method

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.280 
worked better than the other one method
worked<00:02:43.180> better<00:02:43.360> than<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> other<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.080> this

worked better than the other if this

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.140 
worked better than the other if this
method<00:02:44.500> worked<00:02:44.890> better<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.340> Boots<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.940> that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
method worked better in Boots and that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.650 
method worked better in Boots and that
method<00:02:46.570> worked<00:02:46.780> better<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.230> clothing<00:02:47.550> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
method worked better and clothing I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.030 
method worked better and clothing I
don't<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.840> any<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.590> can't<00:02:50.830> find

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.230 

I<00:02:56.000> worked<00:02:57.000> with<00:02:57.210> fish<00:02:57.570> all<00:02:57.840> my<00:02:58.140> life<00:02:59.060> but<00:03:00.060> it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
I worked with fish all my life but it

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.900 
I worked with fish all my life but it
was<00:03:00.360> mostly<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:00.780> subsistence<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.520> then<00:03:02.700> when

teach us and tell us how to do it you
know<00:03:16.710> it's<00:03:16.920> all<00:03:17.300> experimental<00:03:18.300> for<00:03:18.660> me<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.230> try

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
know it's all experimental for me to try

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.400 
know it's all experimental for me to try
different<00:03:19.830> things<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:21.240> stitching<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
different things the stitching and the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.600 
different things the stitching and the
time<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.930> our<00:03:24.930> ancestors<00:03:25.770> put<00:03:26.070> into<00:03:26.430> all

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
time that our ancestors put into all

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.380 
time that our ancestors put into all
this<00:03:26.850> work<00:03:27.470> every<00:03:28.470> stitch<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.910> know<00:03:30.030> it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
this work every stitch you know it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.830 
this work every stitch you know it's
like<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.230> makes<00:03:31.530> me<00:03:31.830> want<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.280> okay<00:03:32.820> slow<00:03:33.210> down

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
like it makes me want to okay slow down

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
don't just sew it fast but learn what

don't just sew it fast but learn what
went<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.330> designs<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.320> stitch<00:03:40.650> to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
went in to the designs in the stitch to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.150 
went in to the designs in the stitch to
be<00:03:41.280> honored<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.450> come<00:03:42.720> back<00:03:42.960> here<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:44.010> be

hundred years and this could be this
strong<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.480> material<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.170> use<00:03:56.270> I'm<00:03:57.270> just
