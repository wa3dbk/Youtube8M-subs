00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the new 2015 Rennes kit and the function

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
the new 2015 Rennes kit and the function
is<00:00:24.720> still<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> same<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> had<00:00:25.920> last

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
is still the same as when we had last

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.500 
is still the same as when we had last
year<00:00:26.310> basically<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:26.970> give<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> little

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
year basically we give you this little

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.089 
year basically we give you this little
adapter<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.080> screws<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.590> hose<00:00:28.740> fitting

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
adapter the screws on your hose fitting

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
adapter the screws on your hose fitting
right<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.480> take<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
right here and then you take off the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
right here and then you take off the
hose<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> quick<00:00:31.710> disconnect<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hose it has a quick disconnect so you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.209 
hose it has a quick disconnect so you
detach<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.480> click<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:34.860> turn<00:00:35.070> on

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
detach this click it on there turn on

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
detach this click it on there turn on
the<00:00:35.309> valve<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.480> takes<00:00:36.719> 20<00:00:37.079> seconds<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the valve it takes 20 seconds or so and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
the valve it takes 20 seconds or so and
it<00:00:37.980> fills<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> water<00:00:38.640> pressure<00:00:38.910> inside

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it fills up the water pressure inside

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.520 
it fills up the water pressure inside
the<00:00:39.300> chamber<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.020> there's<00:00:40.110> no<00:00:40.260> moving

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the chamber in here so there's no moving

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
the chamber in here so there's no moving
parts<00:00:40.710> there's<00:00:41.700> no<00:00:41.850> ladders<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.719> anything

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
parts there's no ladders or anything

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.360 
parts there's no ladders or anything
like<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.440> basically<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.010> storing

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
like that it basically is just storing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
like that it basically is just storing
the<00:00:44.460> water<00:00:44.610> pressure<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.360> house<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the water pressure from your house so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
the water pressure from your house so
you<00:00:46.230> don't<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:46.800> pumping<00:00:47.250> or

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you don't have to do any pumping or

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
you don't have to do any pumping or
worry<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.820> anything<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.739> disconnect

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
worry about anything at all disconnect

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
worry about anything at all disconnect
that<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.329> pressure

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that and you get the same water pressure

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
that and you get the same water pressure
this<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.410> garden<00:00:52.739> hose<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this you get out of your garden hose and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.439 
this you get out of your garden hose and
it's<00:00:53.879> full<00:00:54.149> water<00:00:54.390> pressure<00:00:54.660> 65<00:00:55.320> psi<00:00:56.300> on<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
it's full water pressure 65 psi on the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's full water pressure 65 psi on the
center<00:00:57.719> setting<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.230> spray<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
center setting you can spray for up to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.130 
center setting you can spray for up to
four<00:00:58.980> minutes<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.960> leave<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
four minutes and you can leave the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.779 
four minutes and you can leave the
pressure<00:01:01.410> sore<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.129> most<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
pressure sore in there for most of it

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.480 
pressure sore in there for most of it
I<00:01:03.820> mean<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:05.140> pretty<00:01:05.409> much<00:01:05.590> magic<00:01:05.860> I'm<00:01:06.189> pretty

water pressure anywhere you gotta go

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.889 
water pressure anywhere you gotta go
gray<00:01:27.310> fog<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.880> keep<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> truck<00:01:28.630> or<00:01:28.810> in
