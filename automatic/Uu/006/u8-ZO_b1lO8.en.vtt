it sort of feels just soft and i don't

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.909 
it sort of feels just soft and i don't
know<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.480> little<00:03:46.049> bit<00:03:46.169> all<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.500> feeling<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.799> it

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
because it feels clean i just noticed on

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.300 
because it feels clean i just noticed on
the<00:03:48.569> box<00:03:48.870> as<00:03:49.019> well<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.319> says<00:03:49.530> subscribe<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.160> our

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the box as well it says subscribe to our

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.129 
the box as well it says subscribe to our
convenient<00:03:50.940> refill<00:03:51.329> program<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.989> save

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
convenient refill program and save

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.050 
convenient refill program and save
twenty<00:03:52.530> five<00:03:52.709> percent<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:53.250> every<00:03:53.669> refill

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
twenty five percent on every refill

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
twenty five percent on every refill
order<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.290> i'm<00:03:55.410> guessing<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.829> sort<00:03:56.220> of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
order so i'm guessing that sort of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.830 
order so i'm guessing that sort of
different<00:03:56.489> brushes<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.239> things<00:03:57.389> are<00:03:57.510> out<00:03:57.540> so

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
different brushes and things are out so

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.900 
different brushes and things are out so
every<00:03:58.019> time<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.349> get<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.530> new<00:03:58.739> brush<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.730> get

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
every time you get a new brush you get

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.159 
every time you get a new brush you get
twenty<00:04:00.180> five<00:04:00.299> percent<00:04:00.329> off<00:04:00.690> your<00:04:00.840> honor<00:04:00.959> which
