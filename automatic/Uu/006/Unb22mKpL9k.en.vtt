00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
might actually be a couple of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
might actually be a couple of
professional<00:01:30.840> players<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.409> playing

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

against each other like they did for

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
against each other like they did for
black<00:01:34.829> ops<00:01:34.950> 2<00:01:35.159> last<00:01:35.369> every<00:01:35.610> guys<00:01:35.729> remember

black ops 2 last every guys remember

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
black ops 2 last every guys remember
before<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.479> game<00:01:36.750> came<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.860> was

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
before the game came out or it was

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.240 
before the game came out or it was
probably<00:01:39.020> like<00:01:40.020> day<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> game<00:01:41.070> came

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
probably like day one that the game came

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
probably like day one that the game came
out<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.000> live<00:01:42.299> stream<00:01:42.450> again

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
out they did a live stream again

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.389 
out they did a live stream again
professionals<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.950> European

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
professionals I pretty sure was European

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.819 
professionals I pretty sure was European
versus<00:01:44.909> American<00:01:45.030> players<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
versus American players and it was a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
versus American players and it was a
live<00:01:47.009> stream<00:01:47.220> does<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.060> shout<00:01:48.360> casted<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
live stream does it was shout casted and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
live stream does it was shout casted and
everything<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.409> hopefully<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.040> maybe

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
everything so hopefully you know maybe

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.880 
everything so hopefully you know maybe
I'll<00:01:50.610> end<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.850> doing<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:52.500> really

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I'll end up doing that but I'm really

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
I'll end up doing that but I'm really
excited<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.649> really<00:01:55.649> cannot

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
excited for this because I really cannot

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.050 
excited for this because I really cannot
wait<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.490> game<00:01:56.700> looks<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
you know we've got a little bit of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
you know we've got a little bit of
single<00:01:59.310> player<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.299> tiny<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.110> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
single player and a tiny little bit of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
single player and a tiny little bit of
multiplayer<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.130> has<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.490> show

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
multiplayer but it has a really show

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
multiplayer but it has a really show
anything<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.560> game<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
anything you know the way the game is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
anything you know the way the game is
actually<00:02:04.979> gonna<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.939> entire<00:02:06.210> thing<00:02:06.270> with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
actually gonna be the entire thing with

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
actually gonna be the entire thing with
multiple<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.770> hopefully<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.759> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
multiple you know so hopefully we get a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
multiple you know so hopefully we get a
couple<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.270> sniper<00:02:09.509> things<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.349> usually

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
couple of sniper things because usually

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.150 
couple of sniper things because usually
sniping<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.360> last<00:02:12.660> thing

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
sniping is the very last thing

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.260 
sniping is the very last thing

the end of showing like if you guys
remember<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:15.530> black<00:02:15.680> ops<00:02:15.710> 2<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.160> ended<00:02:16.340> up

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
remember for black ops 2 they ended up

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.220 
remember for black ops 2 they ended up
releasing<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.210> trailer<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.080> end

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
releasing like a trailer and in the end

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.170 
releasing like a trailer and in the end
of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> trailer<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.980> was<00:02:19.100> pretty<00:02:19.340> much<00:02:19.580> pretty

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
of the trailer it was pretty much pretty

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
of the trailer it was pretty much pretty
sure<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.510> Vonderhaar<00:02:20.720> he<00:02:21.170> ended<00:02:21.320> up<00:02:21.380> hitting

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
sure was Vonderhaar he ended up hitting

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.170 
sure was Vonderhaar he ended up hitting
something<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.190> triple<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> trailer

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
something like a triple in the trailer

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.390 
something like a triple in the trailer
with<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.230> iron<00:02:24.500> sight<00:02:24.680> ballista<00:02:25.040> which<00:02:25.190> was

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
with the iron sight ballista which was

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520 
with the iron sight ballista which was
actually<00:02:25.580> pretty<00:02:25.850> cool<00:02:26.120> because<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:27.170> showed

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
actually pretty cool because that showed

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.080 
actually pretty cool because that showed
that<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.040> was<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> bolt<00:02:28.430> action<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> game

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
that there was a bolt action in the game

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.580 
that there was a bolt action in the game
and<00:02:29.330> not<00:02:29.480> only<00:02:29.600> was<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.020> regular<00:02:30.200> bolt

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and not only was it a regular bolt

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.170 
and not only was it a regular bolt
action<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.220> put<00:02:31.400> iron<00:02:31.580> sights<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.060> it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
action but you put iron sights on it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.060 
action but you put iron sights on it
which<00:02:32.300> was<00:02:32.450> absolutely<00:02:32.720> huge<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:33.740> snipers

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
which was absolutely huge for snipers

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.800 
which was absolutely huge for snipers
because<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:35.000> know<00:02:35.120> he<00:02:35.180> hadn't<00:02:35.450> been<00:02:35.540> able<00:02:35.660> to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
because you know he hadn't been able to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.560 
because you know he hadn't been able to
do<00:02:35.960> that<00:02:35.990> since<00:02:36.470> world<00:02:37.310> at<00:02:37.430> war<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
do that since world at war but like I

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.910 
do that since world at war but like I
said<00:02:38.630> hopefully<00:02:38.900> we<00:02:39.140> get<00:02:39.230> some<00:02:39.290> good<00:02:39.530> sniping

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
said hopefully we get some good sniping

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.670 
said hopefully we get some good sniping
