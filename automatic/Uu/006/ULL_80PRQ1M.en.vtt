00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.160
 Hello that she turns on both there is more little attraction of me 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.170
 to adapt to the topic of which do 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.810
 Picture if someone has always been a while people, maybe they already have, so to speak 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.349
 seen the first part 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.929
 Percent or rather extensive video on the subject of Bishop 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.380
 Brighten up the Fondation Sana 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.930
 which you can usually buy are still too dark 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.820
 In any case, I would definitely recommend it 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.510
 To look at comments below there are a few tips that have fallen 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.560
 Definitely next to the problem that you get when you are 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.230
 March in the sixteenth of the broadcast belongs to the dead 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.980
 that one makes with the texture smears I think that should however 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.650
 Priority will be that of which texture 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.370
 Working well with the skin is another dilemma 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 not in motion sound and especially in the drugstore, he is quite often such a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 Mishmash of yellow and whether instead of yellow or for and percent in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.810
 Czech Republic colors chosen 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.060
 So, according to the motto, they had 10 and that's good for that 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.039
 me very very sad 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.519
 in that very quickly so a bit Indian can look moderate 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.990
 now if you turn yellow and red into collectors he will rise 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.490
 yourself 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.630
 and that's not really in so many I would say 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.979
 that's a big problem another is just these Hellmons 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.619
 Niches are sown so rare but also in the right texture 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.100
 The stitches are not these pink stitch foundations around which it should go on 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 However, I wanted to go back in advance because maybe some 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 his hands his money 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.200
 yes there are different grades we know that I only for those 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.140
 who have not dealt with it I once lose in the category 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.160
 which it from my blog in the info box 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.620
 then you can click on it with the whole lot of it 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.610
 progress 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.320
 and the best way to recognize what you mean by money and cheap if you have one 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 Yellowish hedgehog and the Czech Foundation side by side, I think 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.400
 that says relatively 4 out on the subject of Mac NC and end, I also have a video 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.770
 All of them also made me such a prime example of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 this genre 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.370
 jan-felix Pirmin Schwegler today a man with the fly SZ the conceived 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.610
 which both have like everything to crouch for me has not the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.769
 right texture 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.919
 Finch stitches me deeply 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.069
 You do not see that at first glance, but of course you do 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.789
 driving a little bit out of work and lets oxidize per cent in the air and so on 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:21.759
 continue 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.729
 Then you quickly realize that the posting Klomp in the Czech Republic was what I 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.149
 you guys today actual mistakes and that is about the reminder of the 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.349
 Redness around the primer of Aldiana Tirol 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.360
 To date still relatively new in the range costs 4 euros as ten liters of content me 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.569
 I have received a warm thank you 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.349
 I probably did not buy them from me because I grin pl 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.119
 Removals mostly primer very very transparent leaving the saar-green 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.949
 Sting actually does not show so much impact in the end 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:51.789
 just like that 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.239
 slight touch of Grüningen 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.629
 so to speak, on which the skin makes and compensates for redness but this time 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.839
 the same is intense 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.009
 As you can see, I'll just explain what I do with it 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:08.249
 Rome with good feeling in the sun I try it in the shade 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.989
 he's gonna bring in now and here's the percent of Klack around Mellon Foundation 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.389
 Facilities right down to it 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.819
 because it's relatively different 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.189
 Not so meaningful first, by getting a bit of the agency 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.430
 internet solutions 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.689
 maybe have 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.139
 work a little better on the natural sequence today 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.139
 that it is not allowed to write a text and that in the stronghold 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 and we have to get back to press 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.649
 so and the best it is not in comparison with one 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.719
 This is a bit bitter and not so clean 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.799
 worked out and sometimes so a bit and the lyrics 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.760
 but in principle yes clarified is actually quite good this difference 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.889
 if the whole is still a bit worked out 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.510
 and when it fuses with the skin, it is a completely different one again 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:56.389
 effect 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.609
 you just have to work on the dosage a bit to see what suits you 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.759
 The fact is that of course the red is neutralized and not in money 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.269
 that is going to be a very neutral now 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:09.990
 until the 80th 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.070
 is not synonymous for everyone but I think it is always better than s &amp; p one 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.029
 chill 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.650
 Of course there are alternatives there are many people make-up artists 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 Area there is also plot their products not so 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.259
 Ultra sur in but have a bit higher efficiency but he does not come 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.050
 Everybody ran so fast, of course, with Oxigin too 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.050
 In the case of Grünberg's Mr. Grote, she too works 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.940
 Of course, that's a thing. First of all, it's important that you do 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.770
 you really deserve to decide 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.650
 The animal cosmetics Rakes he chooses that he really no pollution 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.669
 of heavy metals and so on 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.090
 but that is such a thing 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.710
 there is the complete comfort flutes because you have to work everything is without 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.580
 Mess if there's something wrong, everything sucked 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.650
 therefore I would personally depend on oxides but I know that very much 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.679
 many give the benefit to me that is personally too complicated 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.019
 he on the other hand i would otherwise if it is with for which one 

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.639
 either already wanted a finished refined pigments then work 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.629
 before the molecules are already sheathed with a certain amount 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.699
 Substance so that are a bit rounder 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.080
 and homogeneously a 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.599
 so let one work on the proper use of ours 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.610
 Otherwise, if you also know meat products 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.379
 who do not work like the alverde of which maybe one 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.710
 Value for money a bit more 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.939
 because they are better 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.649
 you can just write in the comments but I personally think so 

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.539
 that natural cosmetics is 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.190
 Manet yes and this beautiful the effort is for me that still in 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.389
 Of course it's not all that much 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:39.469
 but off 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.659
 it is alright a shortcoming for me is he that his country on Crete 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.610
 Of course, a very large portion gets actually back to 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.460
 a lot of 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.420
 and every day you have a plate here 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.950
 and product Kropfmühl 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.290
 that dries everything on what she is in this corridor that is a pity for me and time 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.809
 annoying there is also a lot of product led 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.680
 maybe he will revise on New Year's Eve 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.070
 I personally believe that the percent son Malik and he is one of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.400
 Report from me or even two where I still had leftovers 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.259
 just introduced here 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.629
 Ellen White has a bit of a brighten up with Mackel 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.279
 and that the Rhine pumped 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.830
 The fact that this is just more liquid can be homogeneously mixed 

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:22.099
 and not like it's cool because he's not the hard one but otherwise 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.999
 Maybe with cotton balls wealth may be too 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.210
 mixed homogeneously 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.150
 yes and that is and me that my recommendation 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.160
 when it comes to the large areas the large-scale order from the federal government 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.000
 Unfortunately, I can not say so much for this honor if this actually 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.880
 reluctant to know that again is a bit too strong and I have 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.969
 Not even Sad Ser or something 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.659
 not always totally uncomfortable in this one-off work 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.330
 because when you talk about the red thing that you split then you put some out 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.409
 At Minden is that he is not a trend reversal but a greened alone 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.059
 and that 's how I damage my problems so that' s the method of mine 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.580
 choice 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.800
 our family is doing well animals
