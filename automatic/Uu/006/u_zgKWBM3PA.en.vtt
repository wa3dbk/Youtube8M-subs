going<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.459> place<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.970> starting<00:02:18.750> from<00:02:19.049> the

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
going to place this starting from the

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.640 
going to place this starting from the
inner<00:02:19.560> corner<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.370> roll<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.909> across<00:02:21.469> so<00:02:22.469> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
inner corner and roll it across so that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.400 
inner corner and roll it across so that
my<00:02:22.920> flowers

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
my flowers

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.010 
my flowers
so<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> flowers<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.240> are<00:02:26.270> kind<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> at

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
so that the flowers there are kind of at

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.350 
so that the flowers there are kind of at
the<00:02:27.050> bottom<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.710> leave<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.220> opening<00:02:28.820> then

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the bottom and leave the opening then

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.650 
the bottom and leave the opening then
for<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.140> butterfly<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.430> plate<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.450> then

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
for the butterfly on the plate so then

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.350 
for the butterfly on the plate so then
I'm<00:02:33.020> going<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> use<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.980> lab<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> baby<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
I'm going to use the lab and baby and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:46.150 
I'm going to use the lab and baby and
isolate<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:39.190> butterfly<00:02:44.470> pick<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.710> up<00:02:45.740> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
isolate that butterfly pick that up and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.500 
isolate that butterfly pick that up and
place<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.240> in<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:48.010> space<00:02:49.010> where<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:50.090> want<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.450> to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
place it in the space where I want it to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.500 
place it in the space where I want it to
go<00:02:53.710> let's<00:02:54.710> see<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:56.000> can<00:02:56.150> put<00:02:56.300> them<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.480> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
go let's see you can put them at a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
go let's see you can put them at a
different<00:02:56.870> angle<00:02:56.960> this<00:02:57.380> one<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.680> came<00:02:57.770> out

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
different angle this one just came out

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.810 
different angle this one just came out
straight<00:02:58.460> it's<00:02:58.670> no<00:02:58.790> big<00:02:58.940> deal<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.420> then<00:03:00.820> what

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
straight it's no big deal and then what

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.040 
straight it's no big deal and then what
I'm<00:03:01.910> going<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.210> then<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.480> I'm<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:02.960> to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
I'm going to do then is I'm going to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.050 
I'm going to do then is I'm going to

take the lamb baby put a drop of it just
right<00:03:05.240> here<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> plate<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:08.030> using<00:03:08.870> a

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
right here on the plate and then using a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.960 
right here on the plate and then using a
dotting<00:03:09.230> tool<00:03:09.410> I'm<00:03:10.100> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> take<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.490> small

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
dotting tool I'm going to take a small

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.460 
dotting tool I'm going to take a small
end<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.570> dotting<00:03:11.990> tool<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:14.470> I'm

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
end of this dotting tool here and I'm

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.950 
end of this dotting tool here and I'm
going<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:16.070> do<00:03:16.310> some<00:03:16.690> dotted<00:03:17.690> lines

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
going to just do some dotted lines

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.080 
going to just do some dotted lines
starting<00:03:18.650> from<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.100> tip<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.580> nail<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
starting from the tip of the nail and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.270 
starting from the tip of the nail and
working<00:03:20.810> my<00:03:20.930> way<00:03:20.960> up<00:03:21.320> into<00:03:21.770> a<00:03:21.800> couple<00:03:22.190> of

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
working my way up into a couple of

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.730 
working my way up into a couple of
curves<00:03:22.580> sort<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.540> following<00:03:23.960> the<00:03:24.110> curve<00:03:24.470> of

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
curves sort of following the curve of

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.190 
curves sort of following the curve of
the<00:03:25.220> stems<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.000> flowers<00:03:28.510> okay<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.750> then

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
the stems of the flowers okay and then

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.870 
the stems of the flowers okay and then
you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.410> put<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:30.980> put<00:03:31.130> ones<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.670> tip

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
you can put you can put ones on the tip

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.220 
you can put you can put ones on the tip
too<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.330> want<00:03:32.510> i'm<00:03:32.720> going<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.959> just<00:03:33.050> leave

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
too if you want i'm going to just leave

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.000 
too if you want i'm going to just leave
this<00:03:33.440> one<00:03:33.680> way<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.290> you'll<00:03:36.830> do

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
this one way it is and then you'll do

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.010 
this one way it is and then you'll do
the<00:03:37.160> same<00:03:37.190> thing<00:03:37.640> on<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.150> middle<00:03:38.420> finger<00:03:38.810> and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
the same thing on the middle finger and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.360 
the same thing on the middle finger and
then<00:03:39.740> for<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.130> thumb<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.590> best<00:03:42.770> part<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.190> is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
then for the thumb the best part is is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.760 
then for the thumb the best part is is
that<00:03:43.400> because<00:03:43.700> my<00:03:44.090> thumb<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:44.540> larger<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.650> go

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
that because my thumb is larger I can go

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.949 
that because my thumb is larger I can go
ahead<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.100> do<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.850> two<00:03:47.420> colors<00:03:47.990> in<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:49.959> stamp

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
ahead and do the two colors in one stamp

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.500 
ahead and do the two colors in one stamp
so<00:03:51.650> I'm<00:03:51.740> going<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.950> cover<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.430> whole<00:03:52.640> image<00:03:53.000> of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
so I'm going to cover the whole image of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.460 
so I'm going to cover the whole image of
the<00:03:54.320> grey<00:03:54.650> flowers<00:03:56.320> do<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.680> lavender

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
the grey flowers do the lavender

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.530 
the grey flowers do the lavender
butterfly

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.390 

now<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.569> can<00:04:08.080> place<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.500> entire<00:04:08.800> thing<00:04:08.830> across

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
now I can place the entire thing across

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.250 
now I can place the entire thing across
my<00:04:09.760> nail<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.239> one<00:04:11.610> motion<00:04:12.959> see<00:04:13.959> how<00:04:14.050> nice<00:04:14.230> that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
my nail in one motion see how nice that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.720 
my nail in one motion see how nice that
is<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.739> makes<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.010> easier<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.550> bigger

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
is it makes it easier on the bigger

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.550 
is it makes it easier on the bigger
nails<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.540> if<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:16.840> larger<00:04:17.169> nail<00:04:17.320> beds

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
nails so if you have larger nail beds

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.199 
nails so if you have larger nail beds
you<00:04:17.680> don't<00:04:17.859> necessarily<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.639> stamp<00:04:19.000> them

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
you don't necessarily have to stamp them

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.480 
you don't necessarily have to stamp them
separately<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:23.950> going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.130> finish<00:04:24.280> up

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
separately so I'm going to finish up

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.030 
separately so I'm going to finish up
this<00:04:24.669> stamping<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.389> then<00:04:26.050> I'm<00:04:26.200> going<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.530> put

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
this stamping and then I'm going to put

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.129 
this stamping and then I'm going to put
a<00:04:27.070> layer<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.400> seche<00:04:27.970> vite<00:04:28.180> over<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.570> top<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
a layer of seche vite over the top and

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.180 
a layer of seche vite over the top and
I'll<00:04:29.260> come<00:04:29.410> back<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.680> show<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.889> how<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.160> looks

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
I'll come back and show you how it looks

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.909 
I'll come back and show you how it looks
ok<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.470> nice<00:04:32.650> thing<00:04:32.680> with

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
ok so here it is the nice thing with

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.090 
ok so here it is the nice thing with
this<00:04:33.100> one<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.669> these<00:04:33.880> flowers<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.830> so

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100

bits of summer but the grey just sort of

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.140 
bits of summer but the grey just sort of
makes<00:04:53.680> me<00:04:53.860> think<00:04:54.100> of<00:04:54.190> how<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.820> know<00:04:54.940> things
