00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.529
 that you are traveling the coast 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.370
 sanclemente in the media actively 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 ask me what you want I do not have 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.610
 no problem above all tip rasa 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.950
 where I'm going to make crisis domino 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 I am totally and Local I eh 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.180
 and take advantage of a little bit that we have 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 aquatic sports knowledge in the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.600
 floor and here is a school to be 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.430
 that well because we are the spa or 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 So this function of a school of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 sharp and the boys here very kindly 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.040
 they have come to receive us we think that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 there will be a good idea 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.280
 is to gather some people the beach that is not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.080
 I had not much experience and start 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.400
 show in the first steps almost all 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.720
 at home they could see a bit too how 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
 you start this sharp or we're not 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.180
 according to Augustine who are here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.590
 in charge of the school with that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 Augustine teacher is in the part 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.440
 administrative or not and well we're 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.030
 enjoying this day a little 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.240
 spectacular or not many people approach 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.430
 when the day is like this with hot sun and 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.890
 a cloud and if ever seen day 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 coming out the sun is not there is not much 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 wind increases the amount of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 classes in the season a lot of people are 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 about people are interested are offered to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 the bigger the smaller ones if the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.800
 true that this season was quite 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 good we were with all ages 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.940
 we are that they are encouraged until it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 encourage from small to large 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.200
 no age limit 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 and good very good we are 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.100
 charging 100 pesos is one hour and the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 guys are responsible for teaching the technique 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.550
 out of the water just warm up 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
 then they get more or less average 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.080
 hour and that be a daily class 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 then we have classes for 5 by 15 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.430
 classes with 30 classes is depends also 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 the amount of time that stays in the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.120
 stay in those who will take when 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 we have our sector all Pablo 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.740
 we have a group question 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.130
 chandok to juan in the return 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.840
 we asked Juan if it is included by 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.729
 course good to the table obvious good and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.140
 will go to take classes in table but if 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.270
 includes the water suit that is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 fundamental because sometimes the sea is 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.170
 a little cold senses of suit 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.119
 Water 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.619

 neoprene light back for all 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.439
 levels for the cold and how we use 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.420
 tables that have rubber pad and can 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.610
 scrape we give you suits men good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 now we take people from the beach and do not know 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 we put them by time themes but here 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.790
 we grab final sad story so 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.989
 we did look we looked for the first 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.370
 brave who cheered and come 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.480
 sorry the ladies have something of 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 experience in this topic I do two 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.190
 years I practiced in the little school of 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.190
 dock 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 that encouraged us 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 joan the key moment that being has 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.819
 that is only one is the key moment that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.519
 moment 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.530
 be lying down to hit a jump and to 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.530
 art what a stupid thing to do there is 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530
 very difficult 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.610
 and that same thing let's show good come 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.590
 the girls know what the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.360
 girls come here we have my friend 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.850
 also that will be encouraged 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.830
 we invite you here to the table of moment 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.420
 summit the name of vÃ­ctor 35 35 good 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.670
 now we are going to the victor test with the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.770
 girls that are going to cheer us up we have 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.080
 show them the moment as is is the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.920
 technique to stand up and all of them 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.920
 we go 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.250
 but they have to see first they have to 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.410
 see and then they will have to repeat it 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.090
 more than anything the most important thing is that the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.440
 middle of the table always for both 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.080
 sides towards the same 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.390
 the same weight when I go to bed 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.690
 right port 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.250
 from feet to head always with the feet 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.060
 never closed the feet open or for 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.860
 aside once I'm fine I 'm going to 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.560
 start paddling one arm at a time 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.990
 never to the two points and at the time of 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.390
 stop me when I'm in the ball I put 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.340
 arms stuck to the chest I take off the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
 chest and I will pull with the tail when 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.609
 shot with the tail I bring the foot forward 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.380
 the water and turn the foot back and once 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.200
 that I'm standing under the tail not the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.100
 back because there is in front and I point 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.100
 forward very well 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.300
 the girls process these 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.640
 movements we are going to give you a while to 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.620
 practice and we will come back later to 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.580
 see if you retain what you learned from seeing if 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.440
 then they can do it within the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.850
 but as not louis I tell you it's one of the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.860
 tougher sports do not have to 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.980
 be afraid of him but they are more cuts 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.750
 difficult that there is really is 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.000
 very very difficult but you can practice 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.500
 and practice thanks I did it very kind 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.430
 Sir 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.430
