ball and I like to add it right here

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
ball and I like to add it right here
because<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.849> gives<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.119> control<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
because that gives me control of it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
because that gives me control of it
other<00:00:31.230> people<00:00:31.439> hold<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
other people hold it like this but you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.200 
other people hold it like this but you
see<00:00:33.540> there's<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.380> control<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
see there's not as much control and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
see there's not as much control and
that's<00:00:36.210> why<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.829> like<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> hold<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that's why I like to hold it like this

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
that's why I like to hold it like this
and<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.850> mean<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:39.930> my

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and I mean I can do that because my

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
and I mean I can do that because my
juggling<00:00:40.680> balls<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:41.129> pretty<00:00:41.460> small

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
juggling balls are pretty small

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
juggling balls are pretty small
if<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> were<00:00:42.750> juggling<00:00:42.989> big<00:00:43.739> stage<00:00:44.010> balls<00:00:44.340> than

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
if I were juggling big stage balls than

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.799 
if I were juggling big stage balls than
I<00:00:44.610> guess<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.030> would<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> hold<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> like

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I guess I would have to hold it like

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
I guess I would have to hold it like
that<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.980> you'd<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> learn

practice<00:01:42.780> getting<00:01:42.840> rid<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.470> balls<00:01:43.649> really

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
practice getting rid of the balls really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
practice getting rid of the balls really
fast<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fast because that's really what it is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.580 
fast because that's really what it is
you<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you want to you're going to want to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
you want to you're going to want to
learn<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> flash<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.240> order<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
learn how to do a flash and in order to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
learn how to do a flash and in order to
do<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.899> flash<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.890> rid<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
do that flash you have to get rid of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
do that flash you have to get rid of
those<00:01:50.189> balls<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.759> fast<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.960> two

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
those balls really fast so it's one two

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
those balls really fast so it's one two
three<00:01:52.200> four<00:01:52.560> five<00:01:52.740> six<00:01:52.920> seven<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:54.270> actually

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
three four five six seven and I actually

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 
three four five six seven and I actually
learned<00:01:54.960> against<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> wall<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.280> able

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
learned against the wall so I was able

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
learned against the wall so I was able
to<00:01:56.549> throw<00:01:56.759> them<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.210> fast<00:01:57.390> against<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
to throw them really fast against the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.609 
to throw them really fast against the
wall<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:58.920> come<00:01:59.130> back<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> me<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
wall and they would come back to me and

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
wall and they would come back to me and
I'd<00:02:01.619> recommend<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.340> mean<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.670> long<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
I'd recommend it I mean as long as it's

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.719 
I'd recommend it I mean as long as it's
a<00:02:03.270> smooth<00:02:03.509> wall<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.590> high<00:02:04.740> enough<00:02:05.009> then

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
a smooth wall and it's high enough then

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.180 
a smooth wall and it's high enough then
I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> should<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.600> should<00:02:06.659> work<00:02:07.190> make

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I think it should it should work make

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.639 
I think it should it should work make
sure<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.509> throw<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
sure that that you throw them on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.580 
sure that that you throw them on the
wall

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.710 

here's<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.680> tree<00:02:15.420> okay

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
here's a tree okay

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.000 
here's a tree okay
so<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.500> were<00:02:17.680> my<00:02:17.860> wall<00:02:19.380> then<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.620> would<00:02:20.830> throw

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
so this were my wall then I would throw

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.270 
so this were my wall then I would throw
it<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.270> would<00:02:22.569> throw<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> like<00:02:22.989> that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it like this I would throw it like that

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540 
it like this I would throw it like that
so<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:25.480> its<00:02:25.690> way<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.099> like<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
so it's it's on its way up like that I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.460 
so it's it's on its way up like that I
mean<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.239> what<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.510> saying<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.930> you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
mean so what I'm saying is that you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.050 
mean so what I'm saying is that you
don't<00:02:29.650> want<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.069> throw<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.430> directly<00:02:30.580> at

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
don't want to just throw it directly at

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.670 
don't want to just throw it directly at
the<00:02:31.270> tree<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.600> try<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.840> make<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.260> come<00:02:32.500> back

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the tree and try to make it come back

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640 
the tree and try to make it come back
here<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.430> throwing<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.750> apex<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.470> hits

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
here I'm throwing it at the apex it hits

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.340 
here I'm throwing it at the apex it hits
the<00:02:35.800> wall<00:02:35.980> no<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.670> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.120> throw<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.420> against

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
the wall no I want to throw it against

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.339 
the wall no I want to throw it against
the<00:02:38.440> wall<00:02:38.560> as<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.019> it's<00:02:41.200> like

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the wall as it's going up so it's like

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.340 
the wall as it's going up so it's like
like<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.130> come<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.060> want<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.300> roll<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.870> off

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
like this come you want to roll it off

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.100 
like this come you want to roll it off
the<00:02:44.739> tree<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:47.290> three<00:02:47.440> balls

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
the tree like that so with three balls

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.309 
the tree like that so with three balls
that's<00:02:50.110> what<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> easy<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.100> then<00:02:51.400> an

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
that's what it is easy and then an

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.440 
that's what it is easy and then an
advantage<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.150> don't<00:02:55.330> need

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
advantage of this is that you don't need

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.789 
advantage of this is that you don't need
to<00:02:55.569> worry<00:02:55.750> about<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.019> balls<00:02:56.200> hitting<00:02:56.530> each

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
to worry about the balls hitting each

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.370 
to worry about the balls hitting each
other<00:02:57.330> because<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.510> more<00:02:58.840> than<00:02:58.870> one<00:02:59.019> plate

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
other because it's more than one plate

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.050 
other because it's more than one plate
and<00:02:59.590> that's<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.370> one<00:03:00.519> less<00:03:00.670> thing<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.940> worry

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
and that's just one less thing to worry

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.180 
and that's just one less thing to worry
about

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
about

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.940 
about
so<00:03:03.940> five<00:03:04.239> balls<00:03:04.510> against<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.019> tree<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.590> like

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
so five balls against the tree is like

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.270 
so five balls against the tree is like
this<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:07.080> most<00:03:08.080> walls<00:03:08.380> are<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.590> lot<00:03:08.769> more<00:03:08.799> even

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
this and most walls are a lot more even

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.380 
this and most walls are a lot more even
than<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.519> tree

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.750 

you<00:03:15.390> know<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:15.960> that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you know just like that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.850 
you know just like that
all<00:03:18.629> right<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:18.930> once<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.260> feel<00:03:19.409> like<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.709> can

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
all right so once you feel like you can

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.640 
all right so once you feel like you can
do<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.099> release<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.640> 1<00:03:20.909> 2<00:03:21.090> 3<00:03:21.239> 4<00:03:21.450> 5<00:03:21.599> 6<00:03:21.750> 7<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.260> do

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
do the release of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and do

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.649 
do the release of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and do
that<00:03:22.769> pretty<00:03:22.950> easy<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:23.670> time<00:03:23.909> try<00:03:24.599> it

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
that pretty easy then it's time try it

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.570 
that pretty easy then it's time try it
in<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> air<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.049> try<00:03:25.409> to<00:03:25.530> do<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> flash<00:03:25.980> that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
in the air and try to do a flash that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.610 
in the air and try to do a flash that
means<00:03:26.760> throw<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.269> all<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.840> catch<00:03:28.349> them

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
means throw them all up and catch them

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.460 
means throw them all up and catch them
all<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:29.159> right<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:30.090> goes<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.599> you<00:03:31.290> want

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
all all right so here goes and you want

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.600 
all all right so here goes and you want
to<00:03:31.560> just<00:03:31.709> make<00:03:31.890> sure<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.099> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.519> it

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
to just make sure that you can do it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.789 
to just make sure that you can do it
high<00:03:32.760> enough<00:03:32.909> that<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.599> catch<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.620> first

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
high enough that you can catch the first

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.690 
high enough that you can catch the first
ball<00:03:35.099> so<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:37.260> where<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> Sun<00:03:37.739> doesn't<00:03:38.489> get

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
ball so I get where the Sun doesn't get

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.550 
ball so I get where the Sun doesn't get
me<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.269> just<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:42.930> 1

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
me and now it's just like this so it's 1

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.449 
me and now it's just like this so it's 1
2<00:03:43.709> 3<00:03:43.860> 4<00:03:44.099> 5<00:03:44.250> 6<00:03:44.489> 7<00:03:45.049> like<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.260> alright<00:03:47.129> so<00:03:47.159> then

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
2 3 4 5 6 7 like that alright so then

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.800 
2 3 4 5 6 7 like that alright so then
what<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.670> want<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.879> do<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.090> try<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.450> 8

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
what you want to do is try to do 8

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.190 
what you want to do is try to do 8
throws<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.829> it's<00:03:50.010> 1<00:03:50.459> 2<00:03:50.640> 3<00:03:50.790> 4<00:03:51.060> 5<00:03:51.239> 6<00:03:51.420> 7<00:03:51.720> 8

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
throws so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.589 
throws so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
fire then do it yeah that'll be that'll

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.090 
fire then do it yeah that'll be that'll
be<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> lot<00:04:17.400> easier<00:04:17.459> wouldn't<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.799> then<00:04:19.799> I'll<00:04:19.979> be

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
be a lot easier wouldn't it then I'll be

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:28.130 
be a lot easier wouldn't it then I'll be
impressed

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.130 

so<00:04:29.140> that's<00:04:29.320> that's<00:04:29.740> seven<00:04:30.160> balls<00:04:30.900> whether<00:04:31.900> to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
so that's that's seven balls whether to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.710 
so that's that's seven balls whether to
breathe<00:04:32.470> or<00:04:32.710> not<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.070> think<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:33.790> easiest

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
breathe or not I think that it's easiest

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.540 
breathe or not I think that it's easiest
to<00:04:34.870> hold<00:04:35.170> your<00:04:35.320> breath<00:04:35.500> until<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.040> get<00:04:36.340> good

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
to hold your breath until you get good

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.850 
to hold your breath until you get good
enough<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.960> can't<00:04:38.440> hold<00:04:38.620> your<00:04:38.740> breath

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
enough that you can't hold your breath

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.160 
enough that you can't hold your breath
that<00:04:39.040> long<00:04:39.070> which<00:04:39.460> if<00:04:40.420> you're<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.750> good<00:04:40.900> then

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
that long which if you're that good then

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.220 
that long which if you're that good then
then<00:04:42.160> you<00:04:42.280> don't<00:04:42.430> need<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.670> tutorial<00:04:43.270> so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
then you don't need this tutorial so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.310 
then you don't need this tutorial so
another<00:04:44.680> tip<00:04:44.890> is<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.850> want<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.090> look<00:04:46.450> at<00:04:46.690> right

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
another tip is you want to look at right

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.080 
another tip is you want to look at right
where<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.680> balls<00:04:47.890> cross<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.850> want<00:04:49.030> to

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
where the balls cross and you want to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.840 
where the balls cross and you want to
really<00:04:49.330> analyze<00:04:49.620> which<00:04:50.620> throws<00:04:51.160> are<00:04:51.550> higher

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
really analyze which throws are higher

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.420 
really analyze which throws are higher
and<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.900> lower<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.770> really<00:04:54.220> try<00:04:54.400> to

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
and and lower and just really try to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.580 
and and lower and just really try to
correct<00:04:55.210> make<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.840> correction<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.440> might

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
correct make that correction you might

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.110 
correct make that correction you might
see<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.890> your<00:04:56.980> left<00:04:57.190> hands<00:04:57.460> are<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:57.670> as<00:04:57.730> as

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
see that your left hands are not as as

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.330 
see that your left hands are not as as
high<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:59.200> then<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.440> just<00:04:59.620> need<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.860> make<00:05:00.160> sure

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
high so then you just need to make sure

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.040 
high so then you just need to make sure
that<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.580> make<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.270> left<00:05:01.540> hand<00:05:01.780> throws<00:05:02.020> a

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
that you make the left hand throws a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.780 
that you make the left hand throws a
little<00:05:02.290> bit<00:05:02.470> more<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.250> mean<00:05:03.460> it's<00:05:03.580> just<00:05:03.640> like
