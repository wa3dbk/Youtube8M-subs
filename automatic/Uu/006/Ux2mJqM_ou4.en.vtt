hood<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.650> we've<00:02:56.250> also<00:02:56.430> put<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.849> step<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.629> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
hood and we've also put a step on the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.080 
hood and we've also put a step on the
fender<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.709> make<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:59.040> more<00:02:59.489> comfortable<00:02:59.760> for

the operator to stand on the machine
when<00:03:02.190> doing<00:03:02.430> his<00:03:02.549> daily<00:03:02.730> checks<00:03:03.170> at<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> front

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
when doing his daily checks at the front

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.569 
when doing his daily checks at the front
of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> machine<00:03:04.950> we've<00:03:05.099> also<00:03:05.280> now

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
of the machine we've also now

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.819 
of the machine we've also now
incorporated<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.540> new<00:03:06.750> hinge<00:03:07.140> cooling<00:03:07.620> pack

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
incorporated a new hinge cooling pack

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.830 
incorporated a new hinge cooling pack
this<00:03:08.310> also<00:03:08.700> makes<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> much<00:03:09.209> easier<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.629> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
this also makes it much easier for the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.780 
this also makes it much easier for the
operator<00:03:10.230> or<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> service<00:03:10.859> technician<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
operator or the service technician to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.119

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
keep the cooling pack clean so as you

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.190 
keep the cooling pack clean so as you
can<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.909> new<00:03:15.090> f-series<00:03:15.510> backhoe<00:03:15.840> loader
