about<00:01:09.479> those<00:01:09.779> waves<00:01:10.139> because<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.529> were<00:01:10.649> you

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
about those waves because you were you

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.429 
about those waves because you were you
were<00:01:10.979> saying<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.310> 500<00:01:11.880> miles<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.719> our<00:01:12.749> u.s.

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
were saying like 500 miles for our u.s.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.839 
were saying like 500 miles for our u.s.
audience<00:01:14.090> 800<00:01:15.090> kilometres<00:01:15.270> per<00:01:15.630> hour<00:01:16.049> for

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:16.849 
audience 800 kilometres per hour for

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.519 
audience 800 kilometres per hour for
global<00:01:17.849> audience<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.479> mean<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.109> just

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:19.529 
global audience I mean it just

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:22.039 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:20.249> strength<00:01:21.090> involved<00:01:21.779> in<00:01:21.899> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.590> say<00:01:22.829> it<00:01:23.009> comes<00:01:23.270> presumably<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.419 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:24.779> one<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.319> strongest<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.129 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:26.639> that<00:01:26.880> follow<00:01:27.179> a<00:01:27.329> weaker<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.499 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:28.409> no<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:29.099> necessarily<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.359> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
correct no not necessarily if you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.139 
correct no not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.990> Abunda<00:01:31.469> arch<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:32.149> tsunami

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
remember in the Abunda arch a tsunami

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.690 
remember in the Abunda arch a tsunami
the<00:01:33.419> initial<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.619> bad<00:01:35.039> enough<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.579> then

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.169 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:35.819> had<00:01:36.349> essentially<00:01:37.349> wave<00:01:38.039> 3<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.639> wave<00:01:38.819> 4

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
we had essentially wave 3 and wave 4

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.929 
we had essentially wave 3 and wave 4
which<00:01:39.419> were<00:01:39.569> actually<00:01:39.990> higher<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.889> worse<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
which were actually higher and worse so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.589 
which were actually higher and worse so
the<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.929> damage<00:01:43.349> is<00:01:43.770> ongoing<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.849> now<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
the the damage is ongoing right now but

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.599 
the the damage is ongoing right now but
may<00:01:45.719> continue<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.590> next<00:01:46.679> several<00:01:47.310> hours

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
may continue over the next several hours

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.569 
may continue over the next several hours
because<00:01:48.209> we<00:01:48.749> talk<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:49.950> waves<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because we talk about these waves that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.179 
because we talk about these waves that
come<00:01:50.819> in<00:01:51.060> each<00:01:51.380> successively<00:01:52.380> producing

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
come in each successively producing

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.370 
come in each successively producing
damage<00:01:53.969> here<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.479> we'll<00:01:54.719> have<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.989> watch<00:01:55.139> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
damage here so we'll have to watch that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.409 
damage here so we'll have to watch that
closely<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.889> again<00:01:56.069> not<00:01:56.639> just<00:01:56.669> Japan<00:01:57.239> but<00:01:57.359> we

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:57.419 
closely and again not just Japan but we

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.080 
closely and again not just Japan but we
have<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.679> regional<00:01:58.679> across<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.309> Pacific<00:01:59.759> now<00:01:59.880> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have a regional across the Pacific now a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.349 
have a regional across the Pacific now a
tsunami<00:02:00.689> watch<00:02:01.319> in<00:02:01.829> effect<00:02:02.249> and<00:02:02.849> as<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.149> watch

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
tsunami watch in effect and as you watch

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.749 
tsunami watch in effect and as you watch
these<00:02:03.689> dramatic<00:02:03.869> pictures<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> telling

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
these dramatic pictures that is telling

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
these dramatic pictures that is telling
me<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.149> since<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> tsunami<00:02:06.869> was<00:02:07.409> generated

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
me that since the tsunami was generated

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
me that since the tsunami was generated
and<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.459> has<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.939> hit<00:02:09.209> Japan

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and it has now hit Japan

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.149 
and it has now hit Japan
we<00:02:10.170> were<00:02:10.289> talking<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:10.709> other<00:02:10.920> countries

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
we were talking about other countries

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.090 
we were talking about other countries
that<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.549> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.939> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.599> path<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.469> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
that are going to be in the path of it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.530 
that are going to be in the path of it
of<00:02:14.130> course<00:02:14.340> Japan<00:02:14.550> didn't<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.300> much

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
of course Japan didn't have that much

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.510 
of course Japan didn't have that much

seashore because they are 150 kilometers

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
seashore because they are 150 kilometers
to<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> west<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> epicenter<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.530> this

to the west of the epicenter and this

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.340 
to the west of the epicenter and this
thing<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.250> moving<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.760> 800<00:02:24.720> kilometres<00:02:25.290> per

thing is moving at 800 kilometres per

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
thing is moving at 800 kilometres per
hour<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> math<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.150> certainly

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
hour do the math it has certainly
