when<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.479> comes<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.899> pedals<00:00:38.370> other<00:00:39.370> pedals<00:00:39.819> are

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.509 
resistant and powerful why can't we make
a<00:00:45.069> pedal<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:45.489> bridges<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.149> gap<00:00:46.179> I<00:00:47.519> noticed

a pedal that bridges the gap I noticed
that<00:00:48.819> each<00:00:49.030> pedal<00:00:49.299> was<00:00:49.569> only<00:00:50.079> about<00:00:50.489> 96

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
that each pedal was only about 96

two point cam adjustment that alters

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410 
two point cam adjustment that alters
resistance<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.549> motion<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> suit<00:02:48.329> your

resistance and motion to suit your
playing<00:02:48.720> style<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.820> cam

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
playing style so as you can see the cam

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
playing style so as you can see the cam
is<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.900> forward<00:02:52.260> positioning<00:02:52.980> right<00:02:53.130> now

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
is in the forward positioning right now

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.660 
is in the forward positioning right now
it's<00:02:54.060> got<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.630> space<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.799> front<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> cam

it's got a space in the front of the cam

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.210 
it's got a space in the front of the cam
and<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.870> more<00:02:58.140> powerful<00:02:58.410> positioning

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
and this is a more powerful positioning

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.009 
and this is a more powerful positioning
that's<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> create<00:02:59.730> more<00:02:59.940> throw<00:03:00.329> if<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
that's going to create more throw if you

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.990 
that's going to create more throw if you
want<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> more<00:03:01.440> relaxed<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.370> simply<00:03:02.790> remove
