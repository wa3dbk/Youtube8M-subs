going to pull into a parking lot here
and<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.959> want<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.319> take<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> look<00:02:31.890> through

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and I want you to take a look through

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.490 
and I want you to take a look through
these<00:02:32.340> bioptic<00:02:33.300> glasses<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.260> get<00:02:34.380> an

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
these bioptic glasses so you can get an

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.790 
these bioptic glasses so you can get an
idea<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.190> looks<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.640> I'll<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.870> park

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
idea what it looks like I'll just park

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
idea what it looks like I'll just park
in<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.160> lap<00:02:38.489> that's<00:02:38.819> right<00:02:39.300> straight<00:02:39.630> across

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
in this lap that's right straight across

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.759 
in this lap that's right straight across
the<00:02:40.140> street<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:40.769> office<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.500> we'll<00:02:43.500> have

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the street from my office and we'll have

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.449 
the street from my office and we'll have
a<00:02:43.800> look<00:02:45.049> here<00:02:46.049> we<00:02:46.080> are<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:49.830> that's<00:02:50.069> my<00:02:50.250> office

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
a look here we are okay that's my office

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.420 
a look here we are okay that's my office
straight<00:02:50.880> across<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.420> street<00:02:52.100> I'll<00:02:53.100> show<00:02:53.340> you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
straight across the street I'll show you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
straight across the street I'll show you
what<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.670> looks<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.510> telescopic

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
what it looks like with the telescopic

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.160 
what it looks like with the telescopic
glasses<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> demonstrate<00:03:00.420> how<00:03:00.570> bioptic

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
glasses just to demonstrate how bioptic

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.190 
glasses just to demonstrate how bioptic
telescopes<00:03:01.850> work<00:03:02.850> right<00:03:03.600> now<00:03:03.810> you're<00:03:04.019> looking

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
telescopes work right now you're looking

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.550 
telescopes work right now you're looking
through<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.070> carrier<00:03:05.610> lens<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.320> Perak<00:03:07.320> by

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
through the carrier lens of Perak by

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.670 
through the carrier lens of Perak by
optics<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.120> lower<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.049> telescope

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
optics and when we lower the telescope

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.009 
optics and when we lower the telescope
you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.100> see<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.609> they<00:03:11.820> building<00:03:12.780> across

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
you can see that they building across

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.979 
you can see that they building across
the<00:03:13.140> street<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.100> office<00:03:14.720> gets<00:03:15.720> bigger

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
the street that's my office gets bigger

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.160 
the street that's my office gets bigger
and<00:03:16.709> easier<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and easier to see so here it is for the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.060 
and easier to see so here it is for the
carrier<00:03:19.530> lens<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.230> bioptic

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
carrier lens it is with the bioptic

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.039 
carrier lens it is with the bioptic
telescope<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.299> that's<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:24.989> is

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
telescope so that's really all there is

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.930 
telescope so that's really all there is
to<00:03:25.170> using<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.799> optics<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.430> look<00:03:26.609> through<00:03:26.820> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
to using the optics you look through the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.479 
to using the optics you look through the
carrier<00:03:27.420> when<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.470> need<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.890> see<00:03:29.070> something<00:03:29.430> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
carrier when you need to see something a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.890 
carrier when you need to see something a
little<00:03:29.519> bit<00:03:29.820> better<00:03:30.000> something<00:03:30.540> off<00:03:30.690> at<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
little bit better something off at a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.470 
little bit better something off at a
distance<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.560> lower<00:03:31.769> your<00:03:31.980> chin<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.880> you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
distance you lower your chin and you're

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.460 
distance you lower your chin and you're
looking<00:03:33.840> through<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:35.900> telescopic<00:03:36.900> part<00:03:37.350> of

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
looking through the telescopic part of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.949 
looking through the telescopic part of
the<00:03:37.530> glasses<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.329> wanted<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> be

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the glasses so I just wanted you to be

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.190 
the glasses so I just wanted you to be
able<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.440> how<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.829> works<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:42.200> always

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
able to see how that works so you always

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.900 
able to see how that works so you always
speak<00:03:43.440> by<00:03:43.620> phone<00:03:43.950> with<00:03:44.220> patients<00:03:44.760> before

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
speak by phone with patients before

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.479 
speak by phone with patients before
