00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.040
 We will get the oil grabbed to in advance to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.520
 she has softened well now 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.010
 add sugar vanilla sugar and 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:39.559
 stir with a mixer so that sugar 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:44.269
 dissolved this you add here 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:47.950
 eggs and keep stirring 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:51.079
 we should have a homogeneous mixture 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.059
 so now the flour will add 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.050
 The remaining dry ingredients are good. 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:01.750
 mix them up and pour in a little 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.750
 egg mixture and stir again 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.369
 we get such a rather thick dough 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.560
 add nuts and raisins into it again 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.610
 stir well so in the nuts and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.610
 raisins evenly distributed across the vise 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.690
 divide the dough into 2 parts and blind from 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.780
 each of the halves 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.470
 such a sausage from what on blue 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.700
 thickness 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.649
 depends on the size of the finished cookies we get 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.610
 2 sausages that we put in the oven 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.729
 at a temperature of 180 degrees to 20 25 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.759
 minutes we get a little cool to 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.330
 could be taken with hands and cut 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.289
 across but such small cookies 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.569
 we lay them out on parchment and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.399
 return the pan to the oven for another 10 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.399
 minutes then let the liver cool
