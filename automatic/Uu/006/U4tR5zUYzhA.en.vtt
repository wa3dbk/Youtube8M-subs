00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.219
 pension plans I'm going to show a lime bus combo 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.929
 of the logitech brand 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.250
 what is murgas combo mk a320 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.710
 this combo is wireless 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.759
 make us 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 we bristle so much french 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.869
 so I'm pretty stable 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 stern we avoid a few cables 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.500
 we can see the keyboard is 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 it is a size a standard 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.530
 shortcut keys for mail 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.580
 audio multimedia keys 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.870
 pausini 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 ollanta 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.989
 in synthesis keyboard quite 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.210
 soft 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.100
 they are very good 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 without well designed 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.970
 It is also worth mentioning that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.300
 if this were not otherwise 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.570
 wireless connect through a single receiver photo alonso kings 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.580
 We can see your 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.480
 know your maturity 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.180
 your receiver 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.710
 use a single receiver 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.539
 this is good because then we only have to use a single vcb driver 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 however you can yes its only against this one 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.150
 we can not use 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.830
 the keyboard and the mouse on different computers at the same time since they use 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.830
 the same receiver 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.730
 We can see 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.100
 Thelma use is very 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.020
 it's not comfortable if it's something small 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.750
 however, it is quite like 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.029
 and here we want is security 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.539
 so that the magician does not lend 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.709
 once it is removed is to learn 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.169
 today we can see him 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.319
 we can see that if it's a pretty expert system 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.369
 he is thin 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.139
 we can see where to go 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.559
 It has its rows 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.559
 he also has his 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.929
 sure to surprise us 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.409
 however here we can also see that they have 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 an on / off button 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.079
 I mentioned before 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.859
 the keyboard standards 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 it's very good 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.909
 the manufacturer tells us that duhon batteries 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.139
 approximately 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.139
 15 fifteen months 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.669
 five months in the mab 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.389
 however these times vary depending on each use of elevate each 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.649
 person 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.329
 that is an approximate that the manufacturer gives you 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.849
 versus I love a lot of time 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.299
 will last us less than that estimated time or if I love them very little 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.299
 it can last longer and that is already to be feared 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.519
 and that's what varies from time 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.930
 also the manufacturer does not mention that it has already reached 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.769
 as for the receiver of tdt 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.839
 ten meters 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.289
 this is very good since we are in 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.429
 we are quite far from the computer without any problem we can 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.529
 they managed to be a bossi movie we are playing 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.439
 and we do not have to be to simÃ³n it takes off what we 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.199
 we touch limits us for example when what we connect by wires 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.799
 Well, that would be all 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.869
 because I'm not going to try them 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.829
 see what happens 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.529
 well I said goodbye would be silly
