a size comparison here's an iPhone 4 it
won't<00:00:16.529> stand<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.070> its<00:00:17.190> own<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.490> think

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
won't stand up on its own I don't think

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.740 
won't stand up on its own I don't think
oh<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.449> go

are the ones you can choose from when
you're<00:00:45.300> using<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:46.129> I've<00:00:47.129> tested<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you're using this thing I've tested it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
you're using this thing I've tested it
on<00:00:47.910> two<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:48.360> fours<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.350> trees<00:00:50.030> kind<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
on two by fours and on trees kind of the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.319 
on two by fours and on trees kind of the
places<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.930> would<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.289> using<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
places that I would be using it in

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.770 
places that I would be using it in
everyday<00:00:54.329> life<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.120> it's<00:00:57.120> worked<00:00:57.449> great<00:00:57.750> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
everyday life and it's worked great for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
everyday life and it's worked great for
all<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.440> had<00:00:58.590> no<00:00:58.739> problem<00:00:59.100> getting

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
all of that I've had no problem getting

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670 
all of that I've had no problem getting
the<00:00:59.460> staples<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:00.989> surfaces

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the staples to go in to those surfaces

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.880 
the staples to go in to those surfaces
my<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.300> guess<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.019> downside<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
my one I guess the one downside with the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.530 
my one I guess the one downside with the
thing<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.869> tough<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
thing is that it's a little bit tough to

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.760 
thing is that it's a little bit tough to
squeeze<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> handle<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
squeeze the handle all the way down to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
squeeze the handle all the way down to
make<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.600> actually<00:01:12.600> shoot<00:01:12.810> staples<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
make it actually shoot staples and I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.539 
make it actually shoot staples and I
don't<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.650> any<00:01:13.799> staples<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.490> now

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
don't have any staples in it right now

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
don't have any staples in it right now
so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.360> tables<00:01:15.720> safe<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.280> squeeze<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so we my tables safe but to squeeze it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
so we my tables safe but to squeeze it
all<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:17.909> down<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> pops

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
all the way down is that's when it pops

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.289 
all the way down is that's when it pops
this<00:01:20.670> table<00:01:21.000> comes<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.320> hand

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
this table comes out and from my hand

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
this table comes out and from my hand
that's<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:24.990> tough<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> I'd

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that's a little bit tough to get to I'd

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
that's a little bit tough to get to I'd
much<00:01:26.220> prefer<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.630> pop<00:01:28.080> happened<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.770> if

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
much prefer the the pop happened here if

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
much prefer the the pop happened here if
the<00:01:28.950> staple<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.939> came<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.630> but

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the staple actually came out here but

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
the staple actually came out here but
instead<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.680> blaze<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> goes<00:01:32.579> all

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
instead you got blaze it so it goes all

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
instead you got blaze it so it goes all
the<00:01:32.790> way<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.299> me<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:33.990> bit<00:01:34.140> tough

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the way for me that's a little bit tough

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.810 
the way for me that's a little bit tough
on<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.560> forearm<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.430> bit<00:01:35.520> tough<00:01:35.670> on

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
on my forearm it's a little bit tough on

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
on my forearm it's a little bit tough on
my<00:01:35.939> hand<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.420> fingers<00:01:37.009> maybe<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
my hand and my fingers maybe I'm just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.140 
my hand and my fingers maybe I'm just
weak<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.150> doubt<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
weak but I really doubt it and and so I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
weak but I really doubt it and and so I
guess<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.439> hand<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
guess if you you know to hand it that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.639 
guess if you you know to hand it that's
one<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:46.200> manage<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one thing or if you just can manage to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.810 
one thing or if you just can manage to
move<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.890> hand<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.220> further<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
move your hand down further on the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.090 
move your hand down further on the
handle<00:01:48.570> makes<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.560> easier<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
handle makes it a little bit easier so
