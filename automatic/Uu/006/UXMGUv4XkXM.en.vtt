00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 all right 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.309
 it seems that canijo does not walk short of 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.309
 talent 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.310
 I'm out consumer and we're 10 seconds away 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.259
 to finish the regular season for the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 canijo and for the warriors and we're going to 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.060
 to do evidently with shit on the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.970
 puta has not gone well is good 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 here will end the regular season 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.180
 of the canijo that take me to the dock 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 but because you take me to the dock 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 good man in the end congratulations 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 you have gained better positional not you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 whole of nothing marc jackson in order here 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 we see how we are applauding I do not know very 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.019
 well who am I the shortest with 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 difference here we are applauding 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.570
 good road ends the season we 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.089
 got our victory number 60 60 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.549
 wins in 82 games is nothing 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.170
 wrong the truth and let's see now how 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.960
 has gone the balance of what has been this 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 season for the canijo obviously 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 the game player like can not be 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 in another way since he crushes is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.560
 Looked up, look, look, look 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 Look, look, look, look, look how it looks 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.799
 happen that we're going to see here obviously 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 some triple but let's see also 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 some true mate that yes that we have not given 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 another assistance but I think I see mates 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.800
 math 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.159
 so if we were mates 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.140
 rock mates 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.929
 let my son crush some that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.080
 always follow the raisins well there 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.280
 is 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.750
 good that and another one seems my no more 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
 assistance I think this video has 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.830
 done my marketing director that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.500
 wants to pass me off as someone 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.690
 generous instead of a pacifier and there 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 is although they have covered me in the mate 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.050
 but good in order assistance with the iup 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.310
