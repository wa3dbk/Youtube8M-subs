00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
helpful in offsetting excessive anterior

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.299 
helpful in offsetting excessive anterior
pelvic<00:00:08.639> tilt<00:00:09.120> now<00:00:09.780> all<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.440> us<00:00:10.559> have<00:00:10.860> some

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
pelvic tilt now all of us have some

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.299 
pelvic tilt now all of us have some
degree<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.840> anterior<00:00:12.840> pelvic<00:00:13.080> tilt<00:00:13.559> naturally

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
degree of anterior pelvic tilt naturally

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.250 
degree of anterior pelvic tilt naturally
that<00:00:14.759> means<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> top<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.630> pelvis<00:00:15.839> tilt

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
that means the top of the pelvis tilt

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.349 
that means the top of the pelvis tilt
slightly<00:00:16.590> forward<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.789> most<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> us<00:00:18.270> have

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
slightly forward but most of us have

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.840 
slightly forward but most of us have
developed<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.890> bad<00:00:20.070> postural

developed some really bad postural
habits<00:00:21.060> where<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.960> forward<00:00:22.470> tilt<00:00:22.680> has

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
habits where that forward tilt has

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.730 
habits where that forward tilt has
become<00:00:23.279> excessive<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.480> causes<00:00:25.109> pain<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.650> the

tightened and finally the lumbar are

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
tightened and finally the lumbar are
rector's<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.920> aren't<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.790> much<00:01:05.939> tight<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
rector's which aren't so much tight is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
rector's which aren't so much tight is
just<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.170> bit<00:01:07.290> shortened<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
just a little bit shortened up which can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
just a little bit shortened up which can
restrict<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:09.150> movement<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> contribute<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
restrict your movement and contribute to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.609 
restrict your movement and contribute to
postural<00:01:11.430> problems<00:01:11.930> let's<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
postural problems let's get right to the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.810 
postural problems let's get right to the
stretches<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.060> s<00:01:16.640> isolate<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
stretches for the so s isolate that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
stretches for the so s isolate that

over your hips all we need to do is take

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.850 
over your hips all we need to do is take
ourselves<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.490> an<00:01:32.670> anterior<00:01:33.119> tilt<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> by

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
ourselves from an anterior tilt and by

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
ourselves from an anterior tilt and by
talking<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.640> tail<00:01:35.880> under<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:36.720> creating<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
talking the tail under I'm creating a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.370 
talking the tail under I'm creating a
posterior<00:01:38.369> tilt<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.780> I've<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
posterior tilt so what I've got is the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
posterior tilt so what I've got is the
pelvis<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.070> tilting<00:01:41.579> slightly<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:42.240> I'm

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
pelvis is tilting slightly back I'm

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
pelvis is tilting slightly back I'm
going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> grip<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> glutes<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> press

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
going to grip the glutes and press

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.270 
going to grip the glutes and press
forward<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.990> away<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.649> feel<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
forward and right away I can feel this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
forward and right away I can feel this
stretch<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:48.240> through<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.259> as

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
stretch all the way through that so as

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
stretch all the way through that so as
muscle<00:01:49.950> we're<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> hold<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
muscle we're going to hold that for

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.560 
muscle we're going to hold that for
about<00:01:51.420> thirty<00:01:52.020> seconds<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.820> repeat

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
about thirty seconds and you can repeat

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
about thirty seconds and you can repeat
that<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:55.200> three<00:01:55.560> times<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.280> course<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.000> do

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that about three times of course you do

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.990 
that about three times of course you do
alternate<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.189> side<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.909> between

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
alternate to the other side in between
