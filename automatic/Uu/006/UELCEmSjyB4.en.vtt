extra<00:01:00.730> statistical<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.930> times<00:01:05.170> i<00:01:05.320> failed

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.639 

the<00:01:13.530> x<00:01:13.799> axis<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:15.049> how<00:01:16.049> desperate<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.619> am

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
the x axis there is how desperate I am

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.929 
the x axis there is how desperate I am
for<00:01:17.009> sure<00:01:18.170> y<00:01:19.170> axis<00:01:19.679> is<00:01:19.890> someone<00:01:20.399> chance<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
for sure y axis is someone chance of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.069 
for sure y axis is someone chance of
getting<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.210> pity<00:01:21.420> shank<00:01:23.959> obviously<00:01:24.959> yeah

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
getting a pity shank obviously yeah

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.830 
getting a pity shank obviously yeah
that's<00:01:25.799> an<00:01:25.950> estimate<00:01:26.429> it<00:01:29.179> you<00:01:30.179> can<00:01:30.359> see<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's an estimate it you can see the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's an estimate it you can see the
trend<00:01:33.409> driv<00:01:34.409> anything<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.920> statistics<00:01:36.020> but

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
trend driv anything with statistics but

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
trend driv anything with statistics but
I<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.349> tried<00:01:37.709> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.520> interest<00:01:38.880> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
I have tried you know in the interest of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.380 
I have tried you know in the interest of
just<00:01:39.569> being<00:01:39.750> myself<00:01:39.899> I<00:01:40.200> tried<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.679> make<00:01:40.709> the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
just being myself I tried to make the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
just being myself I tried to make the
amassing<00:01:42.390> work<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> check<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.289> women<00:01:43.649> gotta

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
amassing work to check out women gotta

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
amassing work to check out women gotta
go<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.489> something<00:01:44.789> like<00:01:44.909> care<00:01:45.299> hey<00:01:47.090> I'm<00:01:48.090> going

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
go to something like care hey I'm going

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
go to something like care hey I'm going
to<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> tangent<00:01:48.959> so<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> could<00:01:50.009> touch<00:01:50.189> your

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
to be a tangent so I could touch your

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.469 
to be a tangent so I could touch your
curve<00:01:54.469> if<00:01:55.469> I<00:01:55.619> balance<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.159> checkbook<00:01:56.479> with

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
curve if I balance your checkbook with

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.639 
curve if I balance your checkbook with
you<00:01:57.659> factorize<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.590> polynomial<00:02:03.950> as<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.009> friend

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
you factorize my polynomial as a friend

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.319 
you factorize my polynomial as a friend
this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> conversation<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.030> had<00:02:09.209> it
