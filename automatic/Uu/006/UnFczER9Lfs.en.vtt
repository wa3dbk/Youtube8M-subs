00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that's what I like these cards because

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.280 
that's what I like these cards because
they<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> backs<00:02:59.050> right<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:01.290> it's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
they have the backs right here and it's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.650 
they have the backs right here and it's
not<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.530> pack<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:02.980> you've<00:03:03.100> got<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.370> card<00:03:03.660> so

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
not the pack and you've got the card so

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.510 
not the pack and you've got the card so
it's<00:03:04.750> right<00:03:04.840> here<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.500> then<00:03:06.040> what<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.489> is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
it's right here and then what you do is

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's right here and then what you do is
you<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:07.000> hold<00:03:07.390> like<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.570> robot<00:03:08.470> or<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.860> can

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
