00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello, I'm here, Andrew Bogdanov 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.310
 funds deal sales group of companies 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.299
 galaxy 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.120
 today we will talk about 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.219
 Paro and waterproofing anything we need and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 where it all came need it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.020
 We, of course, to save money on 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.820
 gas heating 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 so there are two twisted pairs 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 waterproofing steam insulation pair needed 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 preparation is needed to protect 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 insulation here couples which variations 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.670
 inside the house 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.250
 where does steam come from a good question 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.100
 can get out almost anywhere can 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.800
 hide from breathing may appear 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.710
 the very same kettle on any where there is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.290
 moisture from hijacking appears thereby 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.789
 vapor barrier 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 interests us so that it protects 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.230
 insulation from these terrible fumes which 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 are ruined there are also 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 waterproofing for what we need like 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 how to close the insulation from below 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.949
 above the creator and above also have a pair 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.049
 moisture everything that means anything 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 guitarist for isolation put 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.330
 will be installed on top of the insulation thereby 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.930
 she protects him from like from which will 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 condense on the metal roof 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 I will give an example clearly see how 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.740
 it works but it is worth some point on 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.409
 my yes of course rendered sleepy film 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.400
 I think to the bottom of the air above the water 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.590
 and a lot and that it works I 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 I apply pressure that is imitation 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.909
 couple who go out in force and we are not 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.159
 You can see it is full here, but I see a bubble 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.600
 and let's look from above the bubbles below 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.950
 water is not back and even what it goes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 membrane she process the current in one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 direction the air permeates 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.770
 most protects the insulation from 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.539
 from moisture, that is, if I understand correctly 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 the moisture that steam here which 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.979
 still passed through the vapor barrier 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 insulation with condensed metal 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.869
 there yes he dug on this tape but through 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 she did not pass and rolled down to 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.259
 accordingly let's consider the layout 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.330
 how does this headquarters work like more 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.180
 close we have a sectional roof 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.640
 it consists it is subtracted 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.769
 kontrobreshetka obreshetka thereby and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:30.450
 there is waterproofing here let's say park 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:34.230
 which penetrated from below of course it passes 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.870
 we have an inside room here 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.049
 we do not blame you on our vapor barrier 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.510
 Seneca yes yes pass here she stays 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.160
 also it accumulates evaporates but those 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 fumes that even pass through the film 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.959
 died of devils go so they don't there 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.040
 accumulated 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.620
 accordingly they come in 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.180
 waterproofing there they pass as we 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 seen on the stand these crayons are beautiful 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.450
 bubbles for also they 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.690
 rises rises condenses 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.480
 on the metal inside the house from the inside and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.450
 droplets once fall and where are they further 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.130
 go that is best so easy closed 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.880
 a circle but not in this case 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.690
 get airing the roof 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.459
 water that appears on 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.470
 cut into earth insulators it flows down 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.910
 down and insulation 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.950
 stays dry and what can be offered 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.569
 look for your assortment with us 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.940
 wonderful range there 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.290
 Russian manufacturers for the span which 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.989
 recommend proven to be very 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.600
 well and there is also a manufacturer 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.370
 metal profile there are keys this 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 6 there is a European version of this civic here 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.650
 all very wonderful cool bling 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.460
 they you have availability or take them out 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.620
 by order. 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.750
 we have available we have under 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.940
 order we are now we are yes yes big 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.440
 quantity that is enough there we are 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.630
 several houses if you will 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.670
 at the same time build if you will 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.540
 building big buildings is enough 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.350
 bring all good bye to 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.010
 new meetings 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.010
 come in
