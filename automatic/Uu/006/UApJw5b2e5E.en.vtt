00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
that entire second half well I'll tell
you<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> first<00:01:30.960> half<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.320> thought

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you what you know first half I thought

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.649 
you what you know first half I thought
fundamentally<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:33.329> were<00:01:33.450> not

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
fundamentally we just we were not

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.719 
fundamentally we just we were not
executing<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.009> thought<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.640> were

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
executing the way that I thought we were

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
executing the way that I thought we were
capable<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> say<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.340> made<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
capable and you know to say we made a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.710 
capable and you know to say we made a
lot<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> adjustments<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> shut<00:01:39.479> him<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
lot of adjustments and shut him out the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.090 
lot of adjustments and shut him out the
second<00:01:39.960> half<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.350> can't<00:01:40.650> say<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.829> was

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
second half I can't say that was

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.740 
second half I can't say that was
necessarily<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.790> issue<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.720> thing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
necessarily the issue I think the thing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
necessarily the issue I think the thing
it<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.680> challenged<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.130> kids<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it was is that we challenged our kids to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
it was is that we challenged our kids to
come<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.299> execute<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.810> way<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.079> had

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
come out and execute the way they had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
come out and execute the way they had
practiced<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> execute<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> things<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
practiced and execute the things of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
practiced and execute the things of
schemes<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.659> we've<00:01:49.110> asked<00:01:49.320> them<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
schemes that we've asked them to do and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
schemes that we've asked them to do and
they<00:01:50.490> did<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> look<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.540> faster<00:01:51.990> than

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
they did that we look much faster than

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.359 
they did that we look much faster than
half<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> thought<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.340> very

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
half and I thought it was very

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
half and I thought it was very
dominating<00:01:54.030> demon<00:01:54.299> severe<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> second

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
dominating demon severe for the second

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050 
dominating demon severe for the second
half<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> i'll<00:01:56.549> tell<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.909> now

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
half and and i'll tell you what now

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.429 
half and and i'll tell you what now
you'll<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.689> second<00:01:57.930> half's<00:01:58.079> any<00:01:58.259> time

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you'll take those second half's any time

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.459 
you'll take those second half's any time
just<00:01:59.250> need<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> wig<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.450> those<00:02:00.840> pretty<00:02:01.079> special

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
I've thought since day one you've got a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
I've thought since day one you've got a
plethora<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.290> receivers<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.009> choose<00:02:05.250> from

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
plethora of receivers to choose from

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850 
plethora of receivers to choose from
good<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:05.939> during<00:02:06.180> Lazar<00:02:06.630> pick<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> 70

guy<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.340> also<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.820> kind<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> momentum

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
guy that also has kind of a momentum
