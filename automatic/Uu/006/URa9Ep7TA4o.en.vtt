00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 will be the most complex 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.359
 performance match speak out further 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.220
 put everything on a draw 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 do more damage in addition to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 everything such a mission and then well, in theory 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 well there it is convenient to play defense on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.520
 sandy river well, look well, that's 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 they are 90 here they are t1 cunningham 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.289
 lower base for the upper command 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.060
 base behind the team na'vi and we all the same 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 the question from the air is hovering 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.160
 through or again unity command 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.620
 will come up with something that will not allow 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 attack and again it was not so and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.800
 this is the norm, this is the norm 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 let's look after these guys 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 Now, in principle, we probably have one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 screen unity look at getting though 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 maybe we will be a big break 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 before the liver you can and color me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 now I can not I can not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 rushed friends watch how i 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.030
 here guys again will not speak until 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.219
 first team after all both teams 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 receive information from us and we can not 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.899
 issue position equipment everything is fine 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 understand well and let's see whether 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.200
 He is on the line the first contact is mesilovo 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.909
 some 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.220
 Well, at least for the light is Cyrillic 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 Anatolich Two Ninety on X-ray 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.780
 now we are watching these guys but 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.549
 and see what happens next and how there 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 Scandinavian guys will stand exactly in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.189
 the third will not attack as will be 10 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.159
 guys from unity team 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.380
 there is training here see today 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.270
 repeat the feat okay come on come on 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 on the show manu give a look all the same 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.180
 guys but ignore the colors 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.590
 and now for a second we will switch the screen 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.549
 here, too, blue is the same color 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.479
 but so far absolutely nothing besides 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.340
 for the light or 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 and did not see there was no 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 aggressive departure was not on the cat from 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.180
 unity attempts some shooting and 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.799
 the fault there they understood no there is not 69 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.030
 which is why aif.ru and 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:07.469
 waiting for developments on this map 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.569
 Well, in fact, science players 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:18.670
 play hits the light on the center 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:20.680
 but this is the only thing that will show five 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 minutes it's ok ok let's 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.849
 let's go back to the other team yet 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.719
 what are we keeping in mind 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.790
 here are all attempts from one of the teams but 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.349
 You understand this principle, yes, this one 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.349
 positions probably for a lot of things we can 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.480
 say yes she talks about the sandy river 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.459
 Well, I do not know whether the river is written or you are sandy 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.040
 the river well, at least an attempt after all 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.139
 do not risk cook understand so far guys 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.239
 here you can not some super super 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.560
 cool some kind of circuit leaving something 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.569
 interesting on the sandy river 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.430
 Well, there are all the options guys read but 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.819
 understand will be littered with rivers what did put 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.099
 on 2 a grain of sand all of and here you can 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.969
 from written and you have to talk 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.569
 don't believe what I believe in the sandy river 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.819
 the rest is so preparation then 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.919
 now Lesha sandy river yes I 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.269
 rename 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:16.299
 Immediately she directs 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.750
 so guys 5 cards but so far in this 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.030
 tempo 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.709
 4 was more interesting where there was an attempt from 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.199
 navi attack nom again ended 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.250
 nobody and unity you can 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.780
 finally arrange yourself a holiday if 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 will reach this point on the sandy river 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.739
 where they do not take away the side and it would seem that 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.139
 will make navi 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.269
 but I’m sure that there’s something for sure 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.639
 something will come up and there I am not 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.530
 avoid us anyway there fight 7 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.729
 minutes either one team won either 2 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.729
 everything there is very clear and vigorous in any 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:54.689
 case of a little more than three and a half 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:58.900
 minutes remain to us until the last card and 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.870
 rolled and very quiet gift 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.689
 everywhere youtube friend's team is very quiet 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.079
 especially do not try to shine cautious 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.319
 and Cyrillic shake yes there Cyrilloid 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:15.310
 Anatolical permanent just center of the map 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.150
 nothing changes will still still 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.669
 one try either navi after yes it's mountains 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.710
 those akepa mines think that listen 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.419
 let's better chocolate is not an option yes y 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.900
 we have a plan there on the sandy river behind 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.690
 attack all ok let them stand 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.720
 if they want to stand people understand that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.760
 suggested panic had to be taken 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:43.120
 either still does not understand that everything is under 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.889
 control is normal its hard canada and 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.610
 trying to baku infected rotach on and 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.130
 passing 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.099
 stopper pick up from a pair from the mountain with 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.810
 pick go back which alignment 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.479
 not at all expected here really 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.789
 I will finish already in the light on the Renoir 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.680
 and on garena pick up reno he is one shot 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.770
 finish to finish the tank he still tighter 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 have time to take it but need to take 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.280
 and a tatar from a couple gets faces and already 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.650
 have seen lucie to on this position and 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.380
 understand the guys behind us, that's all for now 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.340
 well squandered davano wonderful 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.050
 two minutes 15 seconds left well and here i am 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.419
 I don't know will be very interesting in my opinion 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.330
 ending what they are mounting since 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.270
 still a lot of time to strike further 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.240
 die because of the roller coaster here we did not expect 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.400
 there you will see the hour of anatolich wins back 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.990
 on one shot running also hacked 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.539
 this is very little now 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.930
 Well, there is already more damage serious bid 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.849
 minus two eights for unity and 5 for 3 by 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.710
 8 left yes there is a van on me 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.380
 technique na'vi also yes if in the us 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.539
 which 200 is in this situation can 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.530
 so to call but here I release that I will show 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:54.900
 also interesting there was already that 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.900
 interesting and when turning over the tanks 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.070
 On brother here his guys need 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.289
 to switch 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.289
 now look wait enter 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.039
 already ready already ready yes it guys too 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:17.800
 it’s very special there 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.650
 special things yes so guys you 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.160
 understand that jokes and jokes a minute 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.960
 remains 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.900
 Well, there most likely of course drives 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.729
 recharging occurred forced now 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.410
 again without water here it is we heed 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.530
 the minute remains you need to act 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.570
 need action from us five tanks from 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:39.520
 They have 2 1 levels for the unity team, three 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.320
 eights 50 seconds are close close nariq 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.080
 victory and now if the second wave they 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.509
 attacked the opponent 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.080
 had time to kill then yes well that's what we 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:52.419
 watch see see all the same 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.060
 Here I went with him right here here 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.130
 very difficult yes here diadora says that 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.260
 no no no but there is one more product 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.889
 there is a troyka Oleg but there is a chamber 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.139
 by bit 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.650
 or tablet and trying to escape but how 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.960
 lighthouse that fare just takes time well 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.000
 it's 20 seconds very little very few 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.729
 I don’t know if this damage is enough 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.570
 the team on him role situation to 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:20.400
 I think not enough I do not know they are better 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:23.590
 probably change the judge will install targaryen 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.720
 r200 remains to be done in such a situation 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.669
 according to my left-handed found the answer what to do 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.400
 this situation is back in the guy no 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:34.770
 almost 1000 what it was but it was 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.770
 arson and now what
