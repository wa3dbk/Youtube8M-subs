 thing that comes and we never know too much 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.330
 when it comes or what will happen 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.900
 to pass but it always turns a little to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 vinegar 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:44.570
 people are really perfect 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 it's not these material things the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.020

 it looks at me then sometimes what 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.970
 frankly it's exaggerated month the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.480
 temptation is too great 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 a walk that drips doctor who

 esker besides going there beyond 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.890
 expectations rumors frankly I hope 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.170

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.670

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:18.839
 potential 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:20.099

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:30.629
 dangerous eventually we may be going 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:33.179

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:36.029
