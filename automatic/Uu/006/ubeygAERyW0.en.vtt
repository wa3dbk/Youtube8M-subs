hips up by extending the knees now we

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.149 
hips up by extending the knees now we
usually<00:01:10.240> like<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.690> utilize<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:11.259> lift<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.799> a

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
usually like to utilize this lift in a

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.670 
usually like to utilize this lift in a
power<00:01:12.490> or<00:01:12.880> strength<00:01:13.240> type<00:01:13.750> manner<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.619> is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
power or strength type manner this is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.710 
power or strength type manner this is
where<00:01:15.009> we<00:01:15.159> go<00:01:15.310> with<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.520> heavy<00:01:15.850> intensity<00:01:16.600> or

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
where we go with a heavy intensity or

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.740 
where we go with a heavy intensity or
high<00:01:16.900> intensity<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:18.220> lower<00:01:18.700> volume<00:01:19.210> lower

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
high intensity and a lower volume lower

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.139 
high intensity and a lower volume lower
reps<00:01:20.190> however<00:01:21.190> we<00:01:22.180> also<00:01:22.450> use<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
reps however we also use it in the

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.840 
reps however we also use it in the
preseason<00:01:25.149> as<00:01:25.570> an<00:01:26.020> auxilary<00:01:26.470> /<00:01:27.009> conditioning

type<00:01:28.060> movement<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.750> where<00:01:28.899> we're<00:01:29.020> going

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
type movement this is where we're going

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.800 
type movement this is where we're going
to<00:01:29.200> decrease<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.220> intensity<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.030> increase

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
to decrease the intensity and increase

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.469 
to decrease the intensity and increase
the<00:01:31.990> volume<00:01:32.470> but<00:01:33.340> I'm<00:01:33.580> pretty<00:01:33.880> sure<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.330> you

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
the volume but I'm pretty sure of you

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.090 
the volume but I'm pretty sure of you
strongmen<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.229> are<00:01:35.320> familiar<00:01:35.500> with<00:01:35.890> this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
strongmen that are familiar with this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.279 
strongmen that are familiar with this
it's<00:01:36.310> usually<00:01:36.490> high<00:01:36.880> intensity<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.840> high

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
it's usually high intensity and high

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's usually high intensity and high
volume<00:01:38.560> when<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.070> comes<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.429> training<00:01:39.789> with

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
volume when it comes to training with

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.180 
volume when it comes to training with
this<00:01:40.030> apparatus<00:01:40.720> now<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.440> benefit<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.920> this

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
this apparatus now the benefit of this

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
this apparatus now the benefit of this
movement<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.880> it's<00:01:43.179> a<00:01:43.270> total<00:01:43.659> body<00:01:43.810> movement

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
movement is it's a total body movement

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.730 
movement is it's a total body movement
however<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.369> are<00:01:45.580> working<00:01:46.080> explosive<00:01:47.080> hip

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
however we are working explosive hip

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.010 
however we are working explosive hip
extension<00:01:48.520> which<00:01:49.000> really<00:01:49.270> taxes<00:01:49.869> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
extension which really taxes the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.040 
extension which really taxes the
posterior<00:01:50.649> chain<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.520> back<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.420> glutes<00:01:52.810> and
