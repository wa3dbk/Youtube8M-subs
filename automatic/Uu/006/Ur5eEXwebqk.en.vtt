00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.960
 there is the Peruvian team not with the clothing known 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.079
 we do a little consultation complain 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.299
 what is still the model after the change of brand 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.079
 upholstery clothes of the selection is waiting a bit for the theme 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.109
 of the elderly 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.619
 that's why they played yesterday with this selection clothing 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 Peruvian party at 3 and 30 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 in the stadium Jorge Basadre 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.880
 a loose 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 amount of public it seems to me that the party 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.750
 I should have had a better framework, although it is true that I did not do it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.740
 public c promotion very little the party the confirmation practically 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.640
 had this weekend 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.820
 and so it was also unlikely that people would attend at an unusual time and in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.140
 a day also quite strange for what is the activities especially the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 football not Tuesday 3 'of the former president the afternoon many people crossed with 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 work but we have the cd party images 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 a very weak first time of Peru fought with the ball 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.140
 the Chilean set 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.700
 highlighted or in those first 45 basically by revel the good 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.860
 turnover of the ball in the midfield 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.210
 thanks for the short one you're not going to have a 9 lorenzo kings and josé silva the 7 and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.550
 the good the Chilean team that showed some interesting things and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.380
 up then 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.160
 had yesterday gil pinto no of 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.740
 with quite high but that was always well controlled by the captain of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.070
 this Peruvian team 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.640
 lb number 14 carlos ascues 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.410
 that had a quite acceptable commitment good work also from Carlos 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.590
 Remember that every time it was demanded, he answered 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.340
 very good to the headquarters and the team's attempts 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 of chile directed by Caesar vaccia let's see her image of the second 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.970
 part 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 Claudio Torrejón had also left on television 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.290
 after a shock 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.110
 it had to go income in its place 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.750
 the boy andré carrillo of lima alliance and in this action the first one will arrive 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.849
 from india or portugal another reserve alliance player 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.840
 that marks the first very good free kick you saw him move the weekend in the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.759
 Reserve tournament mark you book shot Juan Aurich 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.259
 and this time he does 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.609
 but at the level of selection before the chile team good response and in the 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.819
 second time it seems to me that in better or very much with the income of day or 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.929
 portugal does so much also to the party andré carrillo 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.849
 Tarek Carranza 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.870
 It also added very well to the attack and, in the end, the departure of Carlos Paz in 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.929
 the arc 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.359
 alexander callens to me it seems to me that in the second time and in general the 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.069
 Peruvian campus improved a lot 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.030
 in those others 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.280
 45 minutes of the second half 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.760
 let's see more actions 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.679
 chile I think very little of the second time 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.109
 but as I told you 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.549
 which I think was very good of her and Carlos Caceda in this attempt 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.349
 d yashir pinto 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.769
 he was very well controlled the Peruvian goalkeeper we will see more attempts again 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 or Portugal in the center on the ball stopped 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.639
 apparently this lp has to be played will have a very high 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.709
 but what has a very good touch of the ball the truth photo andrés garrido is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.199
 He knows a lot about the subject of the reservation as well 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.199
 I had a very good participation 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.419
 yesterday also entered omar I do not think we see here 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.599
 the attempts of the Peruvian player 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.859
 it was not Christian cave was among the list of 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.859
 players who were going to finally act on the subject of participation 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.930
 the university san martín in the South American Cup could not take care together 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.530
 we had advanced to the delegation on Monday not everything is committed and 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.649
 here and a corner kick 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.499
 of the Chilean national team will do 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.909
 the goal the second goal of perú through André Carrillo takes 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.119
 all Maradonian play and marks the second 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.399
 for the team 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.129
 directed by gustavo ferrín a player 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.879
 who knows him well knows the tournament of reservations for good quality 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.639
 that has been demonstrating 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.819
 a team from Peru that I think that in the collective has to improve a lot if 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.309
 they want to see more important things in which South America not that although the 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.239
 next year in our city 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.650
 so also a milestone from here to the fans because you have to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.460
 commit a little more next year 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.240
 we have been chosen as the seat of a South American 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.229
 so let's hope that things improve in terms of the response of the fan 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.830
 also ends up arriving the third tarek carranza the crystal man who already 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.979
 I had minutes in the first division 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.370
 Mark the third 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.699
 and the one that is finally going to seal 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.979
 a very good triumph of the Peruvian national team 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.020
 but as we repeat, it has to improve a lot in the aspect 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.249
 collective is not enough as some individuals
