00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.510
 hi to you poor mortals and 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.860
 welcome to this pic my name the show 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.990
 who explains why the super 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.820
 heroes are super heroes of romulus and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.300
 remus to tarzan via oliver 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.010
 twist 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.170
 our culture is full of characters 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 orphans abandoned or torn from their 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.780
 Parents then is collected by 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.789
 individuals more or less well 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.890
 intentional and whose destiny is to 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.510
 become great heroes the superheroes 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.309
 Messianic figure par excellence 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.820
 this is not an exception to this rule 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.530
 their beginnings 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.110
 since at the exit of action comics 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.670
 number one in 1938 superman that we can 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.800
 consider as the first superhero 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.190
 modern society is deprived of his father and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.229
 his mom 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.269
 while the krypton planet is at the edge 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.010
 of the apocalypse jor-el and his wife lara 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.629
 decides to place their tax it in 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.979
 a vessel to ensure its survival 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.330
 until he lands on a 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.019
 planet a little less in danger than at 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.460
 his 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.690
 ie ours in fact it comes back 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.250
 a little bit to fuck his child in a 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.449
 basket on a river hoping 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.400
 someone nice will get it 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.350
 yes that's it's the story of Moses 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.270
 exactly a heavy meaning symbolic 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.740
 for jerry siegel and joe shuster son 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.670
 Jewish emigrants who left europe 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.440
 for the American dream 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.119
 the little superman will be collected by 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.260
 the kent charming to the farmers of 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.270
 smallville in the kansas 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.650
 this loving family will inculcate him 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.660
 true American values ​​like the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.250
 freedom and justice pushing their son 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 adoptive used his powers to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 do good in the interest of all 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.290
 and if it had been different if the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.540
 kal-el's ship had not landed 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.190
 in the united states but in ukraine in full 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.320
 communist regime has precisely 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.670
 the story told by superman renson 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.260
 written by mark millar 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.790
 a story that proves to us that he is very 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.300
 important to choose your parents 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.770
 adoptive 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.480
 so what do you see if a conclusion that has 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 the merit of being completely stupid but 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.870
 so completely that does not mean anything 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.830
 we can not talk about superheroes 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.910
 orphans not to mention batman so good 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.800
 we still see batman 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.060
 even more than superman it's really 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 the death of his parents who pushed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.930
 bruce wayne to become an enemy of crime 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 if the first appearance of the knight 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.470
 black created by bob kane and bill finger a 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.110
 place in the detective number 27 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.950
 comics in 1939 we have to wait for the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.420
 number 33 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.980
 a few months later to find out 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.390
 a little bit more about the origins of batman 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.069
 is it really necessary that I you 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.599
 tells the origins of batman well 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.010
 yes since the murder of the parents of 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.840
 bruce wayne at the exit of a room 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.980
 cinema is really the starting point 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.870
 of his fight against crime 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090
 from there the whole life of the young 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.769
 bruce wayne will be dedicated to justice and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.719
 I said justice not revenge 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.249
 once again it's because it will be 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.390
 collected is supported in his mourning 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.490
 by characters like 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.960
 alfred pennyworth or leslie tomkins that 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.550
 bruce wayne will decide to use his 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.230
 money and his detective skills for 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.220
 do good and if you think that everything 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 it does not matter 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.209
 I do not have a counter example but three 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.280
 to give you in the flashpoint saga 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.990
 barry allen alias flash wakes up in 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.550
 an alternate universe where it's not 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.830
 thomass and mark twain that have been 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.390
 murdered but their son bruce thomas 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.190
 either he then becomes batman instead 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.080
 of his son while his dark wife 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.940
 in the madness and becomes the other joker 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.489
 example from an alternate universe 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.650
 holman there are different versions of 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.150
 this character from earth 3 a world 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.770
 where all the heroes are actually super 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.270
 naughty the most common is that the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.890
 presenting as thomas care and juniors 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.600
 who after the death of his brother bruce and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.550
 of his mother decides to become the leader 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.470
 of crime to gotham city and finally thanks 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.120
 true batman antagonists 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.560
 since it's all his life is forced 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.220
 to become the perfect opposite of the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.840
 black Knight 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.970
 everything started from the death of his parents 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.050
 little criminals beat the same night 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.700
 than those of bruce wayne by the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.920
 commissioner gordon then young agent of 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.630
 police from that moment on he swore 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760
 to devote one's life to defying all forms 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.890
 authority taking the opposite path to 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.180
 the one chosen by batman the character 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.920
 is all the more interesting 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.760
 using and then hijacking the codes 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.620
 of the black knight 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.180
 he manages to deceive his entourage for 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.769
 better to trap him is that 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.000
 you only need as an example of superheroes 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.750
 for whom the death of their parents is a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 decisive event or not there were sufficient 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.290
 he had to these names so at the first 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940
 first it seems obvious that the super 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.920
 powers of peter parker aka spider 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.610
 man are in no way related to the loss 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.989
 of his parents 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.090
 the same can not be said of his 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.010
 vocation of justice richard and marie 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.540
 parker was a secret agent I mean well 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.950
 been as they disappeared into 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.840
 mysterious circumstances after having 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.459
 entrusted their sons peter to his uncle and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.650
 his aunt by the way during his first 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.600
 appearance in 1962 in amazing fantasy 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.070
 15 the fact that the boy was alive at his house 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.630
 uncle and aunt is absolutely not 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.190
 explained it's only over time 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.780
 that we will learn a little more about its 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.549
 biological parents but much more than 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.690
 the disappearance of his parents then 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.370
 that he was still very young 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.320
 it is obviously the murder of his uncle 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.489
 ben that will push the young peter to fight 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.090
 against crime under the mask of 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.650
 Spiderman 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.030
 that said it is also pretty obvious that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.380
 if his parents had not entrusted him to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.210
 his uncle and his aunt all this does not 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.919
 would never have happened too nice series in 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.240
 five numbers launched by marvel in the 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.220
 purpose of bringing up to date the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.510
 romance stories of the 50s we 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.620
 tells a possible origin of the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.270
 spider man character 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.710
 indeed we discover that tent but 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.300
 would actually be the biological mother of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.409
 peter parker the series dealing 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.699
 mainly of the theme of 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.800
 teenage pregnancy does not 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.360
 will not meet the expected success and the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 controversy created by this revelation does 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.389
 will not serve his cause to women 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.159
 of the weaver waiting but it's a 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.529
 fat slut at these facts trombin and 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.059
 by everybody everybody 11 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.439
 naughty go to continue this 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.819
 video in joy and good mood 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.769
 I propose now to speak 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.899
 an orphaned and disabled child 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:00.489
 matt murdock and brought up by his father after 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.869
 the death of his mother this one is a 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:04.089
 boxer at the sawtooth quarry 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:05.289
 who feels he has missed his life or 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.599
 son to study to become 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.099
 lawyer is good by wanting to save the 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.509
 life of a blind man crossing the street 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.369
 in front of a big truck full of products 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.909
 matt chemicals is hurt and becomes 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.529
 blinded 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.239
 and then his father is murdered for having 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.789
 refused to cheat during a fight 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:20.110
 it's a lot less good only these 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.729
 chemicals gives matt a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.349
 sort of radar senses that coupled with a 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.610
 intensive training will allow him to 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.139
 become of cities art the man without 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.939
 fear and so lead a merciless struggle 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.709
 against criminals and mafioso who 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.779
 gangrene our society and that he feels 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:33.159
 responsible for the death of his father this is 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.689
 once again the murder of the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.279
 only sure person he could count 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.079
 during all his childhood that grows 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.939
 Math to use its extraordinary powers 

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:41.379
 to fight crime later matt 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.369
 will learn that his mother is not dead and 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:42.759
 that she is actually going back in 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.469
 orders 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.169
 then beyond the obvious symbolic 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.860
 opponent god to the devil well we can 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.569
 to say that it's still a sacred 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.550
 slut to have him leave like that all 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.929

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.550
 sure I already know what you are going to say 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:56.319
 all these are just stories of 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.490
 superheroes in real life people 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.079
 who lose their parents do not have any 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.999
 super powers to do justice 

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.379
 and it's true but it would really be 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.909
 silly to believe that losing parents 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.409
 very young has no influence on the 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.639
 person that we can become and there is 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.869
 do not need to have super powers 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.800
 to do great things in life 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.689
 for example 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 adolf hitler and joseph stalin all have 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.800
 the two lost their very young father 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.550
 and then we can also note that 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.379
 several American presidents like 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.059
 george washington abraham lincoln or 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.929
 bill clinton lost their peers then 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:24.879
 he was still a kid 

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:25.989
 good that said it's not because you 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.429
 lost your father when you were 

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:28.959
 child that you will inevitably become 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.759
 the president of the united states i am 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.929
 sorry and then finally steve jobs 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.300
 abandoned by his biological parents 

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:35.550
 then adopted today his famous apple 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.689
 is better known than the superman logo 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.279
 finally be it in the comics 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.779
 or in real life the loss of 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.369
 parents and for the child a sign that the 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:43.659
 outside world is not sure and that 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.800
 to face it and find a 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.869
 pretense of security 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.459
 it will take a lot of energy and 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.990
 sometimes even redefine who we are 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.150
 really here until next time 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.040
 I'm counting on you for 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.840
