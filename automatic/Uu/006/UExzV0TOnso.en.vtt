00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.050
 Then thank you again this time 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.900
 Well internet and seminars 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.440
 I only after self-help manual 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:02.780
 Something that gives you such a naming that somehow changes you in an instant 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.650
 I see this often, but in the conclusion, it's a lie that I say clearly 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.990
 I 'm sorry I'm sorry to say something like selling a fight 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:18.170
 That is the exaggerated catch copy it is often a lie it is such a 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.300
 As long as you are able to change things like this in an instant, no one is having trouble 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.800
 So everyone 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.510
 The meaning of saying this content is good 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.510
 I think you will understand 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:35.380
 A big catchy catch copy like a kind of kind 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.369
 Yeah I that Tteyuu after real or seminar title 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.580
 Because no one us with their audience if Well have to flashy about any 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 That method is a method 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:53.470
 Anything but I do not think this in what went Tadaa temporarily high motivation value 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:01.330
 This is the biggest problem as a rose 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 Sustainability Toka continued force after this I action was continued Rutteyuu things not such do, such as stacking 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.149
 Is it 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:14.440
 But also it is your own to say that that can not be it 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.540
 I know this well, so this kind of big catch phrase 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 I 'm dependent on walking like this 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.340
 I'll end up doing basics after all or not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340
 Hmm 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.630
 But a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.930
 Becomes this leaning and would travel basic is to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.069
 The psychology of these people 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:44.470
 Actually I understand so painfully that I 1 a 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:48.520
 This is you know more than anyone else anymore but I was at the beginning sleep a little critical to say how 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:54.130
 I mean, I also have more than 10 years 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.410
 I felt that I wanted to live in a stress-covered life and want to live in something 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.460
 You know enough 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:12.040
 And also Kou be Tteyuu not progress nothing actually be Na' be something more than that 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:13.250
 I understand that I understand and understand the internal affairs so I can understand how painful it is 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.330
 However 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:23.620
 When a person to act 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:25.890
 It has the property that if there is no uncontrollable desire or intolerable pain, it will not move to action 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.890
 Right 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:39.170
 It is, however I guess I do I say this as much this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.550
 I desire and serves as pain 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 There is no taste unless it has a lot of things in everyday life 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:53.750
 Even went so pain Toka desire and money, such as intense I went the other way emotion is shaken 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.160
 There is no such thing as 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.700
 I think most of the day-to-day repeated inertia and a week of seafood and it no 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.670
 Right 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:14.400
 It way is real is or to overcome this it is a cover underwear 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.400
 There is only one way to get people to guide you 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:25.150
 First create opportunities whether action detonator for causing the agent Mora made to another person other than your own 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.410
 It is true that it is true 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:33.220
 It is, of course it is a person other than the myself 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.419
 I wonder if they'll be your reasonable create opportunities to their own 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.220
 I wonder if you already know how to do that 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.790
 It will be a little different story 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.560
 Yeah it's just 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:53.230
 It is in line for Tteyuu effective way its way without a little corn 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:05:00.940
 It is something I say in my experience, but I 'm not aware of it 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:06.160
 And it is the technology called coaching that is effective in creating this unreasonable opportunity 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.180
 This though Are there counseling from and it is intended that similar consulting 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.150
 Luo Well I actually 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:17.389
 The talk will be long, but it's totally different, isn't it different? 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:24.409
 Please try to use these by all means 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:29.360
 We are wondering Fu called Do not if it is possible to take advantage of the tips to find a sound way out of life 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:32.199
 It was a strategy meeting to create the opportunity to change the life above 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.199
 Thank you very much 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.120
