00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.950
 general in all pc tutorials and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.960
 we will start with life 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.519
 Well, the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.940
 this study will be about how 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.130
 and know if I do not put microphone to walk 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.870
 in our good pc what we have to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.550
 to do is go to the control panel 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.380
 let's deposit the audio sound 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.429
 let's go to sound and audio device 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 well here we go to voice up here then 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.510
 we arrived to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.350
 as it is hardware test down here 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.719
 let's go to the next 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.289
 and here we have to wait a few minutes 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.289
 the soils 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 I'm going to wait for the video because it 's very 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.329
 Short able to appear a kart x 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.449
 block or something from your put you 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.310
 unlock that to appear before is 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 a crankcase here 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.090
 in addition to those of this measure 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 like this but not so great just the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.260
 unlock and you're done 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.550
 well what this does is tests to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.010
 act like this our 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.350
 how is our sound on our pc is 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.170
 our microphone me in this case are 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 microphones when headphones 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.360
 well we wait for the time 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 well they saw that here it goes up well 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 down here and up here this does not interest 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.580
 this part is not this volume here 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 they have to put select only 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.110
 selections if they have not selected 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 they just select good they did not see that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.140
 like it goes green when I'm 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.650
 talking they saw if I lower it down the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.080
 volume and soil if not stronger rise 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.190
 the volume mister that's not good 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:58.940

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.790
 the selected half if they are not 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.049
