00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.890
 Welcome, the system enter Brazil for the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.900
 manufacture of seats and backrests 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 customized wheelchair with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.940
 your company will be able to meet the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 better shape the patients with alterations 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.990
 postural disorders such as hyperlordosis 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 scoliosis with different 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 degrees of severity the system 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 customized to work as follows 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630
 This evaluation takes place with the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 equipped wheelchair simulator 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.969
 with a pair of flexible cushions 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 this time the therapists the commodo 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.460
 patient in the simulator as a goal of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 reduce elastic deformities and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 accommodate the plastic deformities already 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 existing 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.850
 the equipment is capable of recording the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.829
 mold the patient's body so that in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 Then the data from these surfaces 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.559
 scanned and sent to the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 with a scanner 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 the points that make up the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 the surface of the mold are scanned and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.479
 sent to a computer 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.820
 the points are captured line line 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.430
 following a careful order to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.030
 ensure a fair representation of the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.909
 original surface since the data 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.909
 on the computer are dedicated software 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 is used to filter the data and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 adjust to the surface 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.829
 this moment also occurs in printing 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.720
 the image and the size of the image 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.740
 within a virtual block of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 rigid polypropylene block which will be 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.829
 used in the machining process after 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 the data is sent by 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.950
 numeric code for a ceni machine if 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.540
 this machine has the responsibility 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.560
 excuse a faithful copy of the body of the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.320
 patient 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.380
 operating on three axes the machine in 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.079
 few minutes to fulfill its function 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.149
 the process is finished with the injection of 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.849
 foam on the senate block 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.670
 with this system we can produce a 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.590
 single piece without the need of gluing 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.800
 parts or make patches 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.319
 to produce seats and backrests 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.900
 so we reduced the number of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.260
 errors and we have managed to ensure 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 faithful copy of patterned flexible foam 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.840
 at the time of the evaluation the results of the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.269
 customized system of digisis brazil 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.420
 have been positive mainly for 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.860
 patients with postural alterations 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.660
 significant reduction of component 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 elastic in scoliosis pictures 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 very marked and accommodation of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.829
 and reversible deformities also have 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.989
 have been successfully observed 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.329
 with the system we are able to offer 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.290
 correct posture without losing the 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.420
 comfort 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.340
 It should be remembered that all processes 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.579
 in this video are accompanied by 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.000
 therapists and orthopedic technicians 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.239
 specialized 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.940
 This is Dish Brazil creating a new 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.940
 concept itself has for your company
