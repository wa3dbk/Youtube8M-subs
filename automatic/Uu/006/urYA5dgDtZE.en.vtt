00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.840 

alright<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> few<00:00:22.619> months<00:00:22.890> back<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.100> unboxed<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
alright so a few months back I unboxed a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
alright so a few months back I unboxed a
thing<00:00:24.269> called<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.900> pop<00:00:25.140> phone<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.529> guy

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
thing called the pop phone this guy

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.189 
thing called the pop phone this guy
right<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.539> I<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.689> gonna<00:00:27.840> give<00:00:28.080> my

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
right here and I was gonna give my

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.779 
right here and I was gonna give my
review<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.070> never<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.580> on

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
review but I just never got it on

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.950 
review but I just never got it on
through<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.090> there's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> perfectly<00:00:30.840> good

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
through and there's a perfectly good

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.790 
through and there's a perfectly good
reason<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
reason for that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
reason for that
the<00:00:32.430> reason<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.690> never<00:00:34.290> got

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the reason for that is I never got

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.280 
the reason for that is I never got
around<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.190> using<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.790> thing<00:00:36.290> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
around to actually using this thing this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.220 
around to actually using this thing this
thing<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.070> impractical<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.809> no<00:00:40.050> idea

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
thing was so impractical I had no idea

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
thing was so impractical I had no idea
if<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.770> should<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.820> everywhere<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
if I should take it with me everywhere I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.619 
if I should take it with me everywhere I
went<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> should<00:00:42.960> take<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.230> too<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:45.510> know

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
went if I should take it too you know

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.950 
went if I should take it too you know
when<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:45.899> backpack<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:47.210> just<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.899> just

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
when my backpack with me just it just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
when my backpack with me just it just
was<00:00:49.260> completely<00:00:49.770> impractical<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.550> me<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
was completely impractical for me to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
was completely impractical for me to
pull<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.170> phone<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.800> ringing

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
pull out my phone when it was ringing

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.700 
pull out my phone when it was ringing
and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.149> plug<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> answer

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and then to plug this in then to answer

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
and then to plug this in then to answer
the<00:00:55.980> phone<00:00:56.190> call<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.239> two

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the phone call it was just like two

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.889 
the phone call it was just like two
extra<00:00:57.899> steps<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.320> did<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.710> need<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
extra steps I did not need to do so I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
extra steps I did not need to do so I
just<00:01:00.930> never<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.680> got<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.129> using<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
just never really got around to using it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.719 
just never really got around to using it
but<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.149> tried<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> few<00:01:03.809> times<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.729> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
but I have tried it a few times and I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.710 
but I have tried it a few times and I
thought<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.090> would<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.210> good<00:01:06.510> enough<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
thought that would be good enough to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
thought that would be good enough to
give<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.049> opinion<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.340> off

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
give my opinion on this so first off

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.160 
give my opinion on this so first off
what<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.090> about<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.540> pop<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> pop

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
what do I like about the pop on the pop

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
what do I like about the pop on the pop
phone<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> design<00:01:11.390> before<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> even

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
phone I like the design before I even

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
phone I like the design before I even
get<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> functionality<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> design

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
get to the functionality it's the design

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
get to the functionality it's the design
I<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.280> enjoy<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> design<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.810> quality<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I really enjoy the design the quality is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
I really enjoy the design the quality is
made<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.460> nice<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.909> doesn't

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
made really not really nice it doesn't

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
made really not really nice it doesn't
feel<00:01:18.330> cheap<00:01:19.130> it's<00:01:20.130> light<00:01:20.430> obviously<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
feel cheap it's light obviously but it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
feel cheap it's light obviously but it
doesn't<00:01:23.369> feel<00:01:23.460> cheap<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> fact<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
doesn't feel cheap I like the fact that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
doesn't feel cheap I like the fact that
it's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.960> matte<00:01:25.530> black<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> doesn't<00:01:26.490> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's a matte black so it doesn't really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.149 
it's a matte black so it doesn't really
attract<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> finger<00:01:27.630> prints

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
attract a lot of finger prints

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
attract a lot of finger prints
it<00:01:29.159> hasn't<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:29.759> scuffed<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.450> then

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it hasn't really got scuffed up but then

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.670 
it hasn't really got scuffed up but then
again<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.750> haven't<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.200> taken<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
again I haven't really taken it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.440 
again I haven't really taken it
everywhere<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.189> me

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
everywhere with me

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
everywhere with me
but<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.960> build<00:01:34.229> quality<00:01:34.380> feels<00:01:34.920> very<00:01:35.130> nice<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
would not be the greatest idea it just

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.539 
would not be the greatest idea it just
takes<00:03:22.299> up<00:03:22.450> more<00:03:22.660> time<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.440> few<00:03:24.069> extra<00:03:24.400> more

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
takes up more time it's a few extra more

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.740 
takes up more time it's a few extra more
steps<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.650> not<00:03:26.799> very<00:03:27.630> practical<00:03:28.630> in

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
steps it's just not very practical in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.170 
steps it's just not very practical in
that<00:03:28.870> aspect<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.609> that's<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.790> only<00:03:30.879> thing

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
that aspect so that's the only thing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.699 
that aspect so that's the only thing
it's<00:03:31.359> just<00:03:31.510> it's<00:03:31.629> kind<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.870> hard<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.079> find

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
it's just it's kind of hard to find

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.039 
it's just it's kind of hard to find
where<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.129> fits<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.700> my<00:03:34.090> personal<00:03:34.599> life<00:03:34.660> but

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
where it fits in my personal life but

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.330 
where it fits in my personal life but
like<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.290> said<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:35.650> using<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:36.010> as<00:03:36.129> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
like I said if you're using it as you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.550 
like I said if you're using it as you
can<00:03:36.519> replace<00:03:36.930> using<00:03:37.930> another<00:03:38.109> application<00:03:38.410> of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
can replace using another application of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.930 
can replace using another application of
your<00:03:38.709> place<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:38.980> has<00:03:39.069> your<00:03:39.190> main<00:03:39.400> line<00:03:39.700> then

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
your place that has your main line then

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.190 
your place that has your main line then
that's<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.419> think<00:03:40.480> that'd<00:03:40.750> probably<00:03:40.840> be<00:03:41.079> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that's I think that'd probably be the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.080 
that's I think that'd probably be the
best<00:03:41.410> way<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.650> use<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:42.010> for<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.579> that's<00:03:42.699> my<00:03:42.819> kind

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
best way to use it for so that's my kind

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.819 
best way to use it for so that's my kind
of<00:03:43.150> review<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.569> opinion<00:03:43.930> on<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.379> pop<00:03:44.590> phone
