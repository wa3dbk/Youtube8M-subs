and I'm not normally a big fan of hack
squats<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.260> find<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.770> can

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
squats because I find they can

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.950 
squats because I find they can
a<00:02:22.920> bit<00:02:23.610> painful<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> knees<00:02:24.600> they<00:02:24.840> can

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
a bit painful on the knees they can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.630 
a bit painful on the knees they can
cause<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> lot<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.440> pressure<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.160> your<00:02:26.460> knee

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
cause a lot of pressure on your knee

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.120 
cause a lot of pressure on your knee
joint<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.110> felt<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.680> good<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
joint but this one felt really good the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.430 
joint but this one felt really good the
way<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.610> angled<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.900> way<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
way that it's angled the way that the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.070 
way that it's angled the way that the
sled<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> footplate<00:02:32.850> works<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
sled and the footplate works and it's a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.420 
sled and the footplate works and it's a
really<00:02:34.290> big<00:02:34.500> foot<00:02:34.770> plate<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.130> you'll<00:02:35.250> notice

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
really big foot plate as you'll notice

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.100 
really big foot plate as you'll notice
so<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> lot<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> room<00:02:36.300> there<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so you got a lot of room there to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.310 
so you got a lot of room there to
experiment<00:02:38.100> with<00:02:38.130> different<00:02:38.670> width<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.210> your

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
experiment with different width of your

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.780 
experiment with different width of your
stance<00:02:40.320> but<00:02:40.680> again<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.400> smooth

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
stance but again it's a really smooth

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550 
stance but again it's a really smooth
machine<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.300> didn't<00:02:42.810> bother<00:02:42.960> my<00:02:43.200> knees<00:02:43.380> at

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
machine and didn't bother my knees at

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.010 
machine and didn't bother my knees at
all<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.340> liked<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.790> body<00:02:45.450> masters

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
all so I really liked this body masters

00:02:46.020 --> 00:03:06.110

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.200 
here I'm doing some work for the lower
back<00:04:38.650> specifically<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.669> spinal<00:04:40.150> erectors

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
back specifically the spinal erectors

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.740 
back specifically the spinal erectors
with<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.199> hyperextension<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.539> an

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
with the hyperextension and this is an

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.629 
with the hyperextension and this is an
awesome<00:04:43.960> exercise<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:45.009> really<00:04:45.280> works<00:04:45.460> that

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
awesome exercise that really works that

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.460 
awesome exercise that really works that
hold<00:04:45.850> posterior<00:04:46.509> chains<00:04:46.840> who's<00:04:47.139> going<00:04:47.289> to<00:04:47.350> get

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
hold posterior chains who's going to get

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.920 
hold posterior chains who's going to get
everything<00:04:47.919> from<00:04:48.220> your<00:04:48.520> spinal<00:04:49.120> erectors<00:04:49.389> or

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
everything from your spinal erectors or

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.230 
everything from your spinal erectors or
glutes<00:04:50.229> your<00:04:50.350> hamstrings<00:04:50.979> basically<00:04:51.940> all<00:04:52.090> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
glutes your hamstrings basically all the

glutes your hamstrings basically all the
major<00:04:52.449> muscles<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.320> back<00:04:53.470> of<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.740> body

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
major muscles in the back of the body

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.159 
major muscles in the back of the body
and<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.150> this<00:04:55.330> particular<00:04:55.690> variation

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
and I like this particular variation

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.430 
and I like this particular variation
this<00:04:56.560> one<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.039> allows<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.930> up<00:04:59.050> till

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
this one here allows you to go up till

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.260 
this one here allows you to go up till
your<00:04:59.590> body<00:04:59.710> is<00:05:00.009> horizontal<00:05:00.789> at<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.060> top<00:05:01.240> of

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
your body is horizontal at the top of

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.300 
your body is horizontal at the top of
the<00:05:01.449> move<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.500> find<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.800> this<00:05:02.949> one<00:05:03.160> really

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
the move and I find that this one really

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.370 
the move and I find that this one really
gives<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:03.699> good<00:05:04.090> peak<00:05:04.449> contraction<00:05:04.690> in

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
gives you a good peak contraction in

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:13.379 
gives you a good peak contraction in
that<00:05:06.130> lower<00:05:06.430> back<00:05:06.639> area<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:13.000> final
