batteries in
so<00:03:24.980> what<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.519> do<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.820> unscrew<00:03:26.360> that

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
so what you have to do is unscrew that

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.160 
so what you have to do is unscrew that
it<00:03:27.019> takes<00:03:27.230> three<00:03:27.440> triple<00:03:28.040> A's<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.870> yes<00:03:29.900> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
it takes three triple A's so yes and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.170 
it takes three triple A's so yes and
they<00:03:30.350> actually<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.769> not<00:03:30.980> too<00:03:31.340> bad<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.940> does

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
they actually is not too bad it does

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.770 
they actually is not too bad it does
fold<00:03:32.420> in<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.400> basically<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.420> would<00:03:35.450> just

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
fold in and basically you would just

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.920 
fold in and basically you would just
whip<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.080> out<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.950> has<00:03:40.540> unless<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.660> see<00:03:41.900> it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
whip it out and it has unless you see it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.120 
whip it out and it has unless you see it
