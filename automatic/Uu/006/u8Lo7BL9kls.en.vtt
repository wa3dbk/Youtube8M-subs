00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.990
 There are 2 carrots 150 grams of ham 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.170
 of salt the first thing we're going to do to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 to cook the rice is to put a pot on fire 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.530
 to strong fire at the beginning and we will throw 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.420
 a liter of water will take until 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 start to boil once you are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.379
 boiling water we put a little bit of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.379
 Salt and we throw the rice 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 we will move a little 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.040
 and let it cook, we'll leave it like 15 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 minutes covered so you are 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.130
 before once they've been cooked 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.130
 we are going to wash it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.039
 now we let it drain until it 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.079
 let's use now we will cut the 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.710
 ingredients first we will cut the 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.710
 spring onion 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.580
 then cut the ham and what 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.180
 we will do in squares now we will peel 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.180
 the carrots 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.690
 once we have them peeled we go 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.310
 to grate 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.680
 and then we will make the tortillas 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.830
 French and for this we will put a 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.410
 pan over high heat at the beginning 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.890
 we put a little oil and beat 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.890
 the eggs 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.730

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 pan-fried eggs 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.140

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.900

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.060
 two tortillas because we like it a lot 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.970

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.180
 strong fire now we will throw the oil 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.890
 a good trickle we will throw the onion 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.520

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.710

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.810
 we have the poached onion and we're going to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.930
