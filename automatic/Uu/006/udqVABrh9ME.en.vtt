their<00:05:23.490> android<00:05:23.790> 3.1<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.570> we're<00:05:24.660> not<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.870> 3<00:05:24.990> by<00:05:25.110> 2

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
their android 3.1 so we're not on 3 by 2

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.350 
their android 3.1 so we're not on 3 by 2
again<00:05:25.440> like<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.800> said<00:05:25.830> doesn't<00:05:26.820> have<00:05:26.910> TouchWiz

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
again like I said doesn't have TouchWiz

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.450 
again like I said doesn't have TouchWiz
so<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.660> hasn't<00:05:27.780> been<00:05:27.930> messed<00:05:28.170> with<00:05:28.320> if<00:05:29.280> we<00:05:29.370> go

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
so it hasn't been messed with if we go

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.930 
so it hasn't been messed with if we go
into<00:05:29.580> storage<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:31.620> can<00:05:31.770> see<00:05:32.010> idea<00:05:32.340> of<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.520> 16

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
into storage you can see idea of the 16

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.970 
into storage you can see idea of the 16
gig<00:05:33.150> version<00:05:33.530> 13<00:05:34.530> gig<00:05:34.800> available<00:05:36.440> okay<00:05:37.440> let's

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
gig version 13 gig available okay let's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.770 
gig version 13 gig available okay let's
go<00:05:38.130> back<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.580> what<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.300> probably<00:05:39.450> want<00:05:39.750> to

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
go back and what you probably want to

see<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.020> this<00:05:40.200> speed<00:05:40.590> test<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.550> speed<00:05:41.760> test

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
see is this speed test so the speed test

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.210 
see is this speed test so the speed test
app<00:05:42.150> obviously<00:05:42.750> doesn't<00:05:42.960> build<00:05:43.290> for<00:05:43.680> tablet

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
app obviously doesn't build for tablet

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.280 
app obviously doesn't build for tablet
so<00:05:44.340> it's<00:05:44.460> going<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.610> look<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.850> little<00:05:44.970> odd<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.570> I

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
so it's going to look a little odd and I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.470 
so it's going to look a little odd and I
ran<00:05:46.530> this<00:05:46.710> when<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.580> first<00:05:47.850> got<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.330> it

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
ran this when I first got it and it

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.870 
ran this when I first got it and it
didn't<00:05:48.690> get<00:05:48.780> crazy<00:05:49.290> scores<00:05:49.980> because<00:05:50.340> like<00:05:50.790> I

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
didn't get crazy scores because like I

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.850 
didn't get crazy scores because like I
said<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.150> don't<00:05:51.270> have<00:05:51.510> full<00:05:51.900> four<00:05:52.200> bars<00:05:52.500> here

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
said I don't have full four bars here

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.880 
said I don't have full four bars here
but<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.880> still<00:05:54.270> is<00:05:54.420> cooking<00:05:54.780> along<00:05:55.020> except<00:05:55.860> for

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
but it still is cooking along except for

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.090 
but it still is cooking along except for
today<00:05:56.310> oh<00:05:57.200> there<00:05:58.200> we<00:05:58.290> go<00:05:58.320> picking<00:05:58.770> up<00:05:58.860> speed

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
today oh there we go picking up speed

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.170 
today oh there we go picking up speed
now<00:05:59.160> I<00:06:00.080> want<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.110> say<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.290> hit<00:06:01.560> about<00:06:01.740> 8<00:06:02.040> as<00:06:02.490> a

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
now I want to say I hit about 8 as a

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.380 
now I want to say I hit about 8 as a
high<00:06:05.000> again<00:06:06.000> not<00:06:06.690> full<00:06:07.050> four<00:06:07.500> bars<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:09.270> know

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
high again not full four bars you know

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.940 
high again not full four bars you know
this<00:06:09.570> coverage<00:06:10.080> could<00:06:10.260> be<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.410> little<00:06:10.590> spotty

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
this coverage could be a little spotty

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.760 
this coverage could be a little spotty
in<00:06:11.130> my<00:06:11.220> house<00:06:11.430> here<00:06:11.700> in<00:06:11.790> Portland<00:06:12.710> yeah<00:06:13.710> you

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
in my house here in Portland yeah you

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.710 
in my house here in Portland yeah you
can<00:06:13.980> see<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.160> uploads<00:06:14.460> not<00:06:14.760> anywhere<00:06:15.660> near

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
can see the uploads not anywhere near

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.330 
can see the uploads not anywhere near
where<00:06:16.080> they<00:06:16.200> should<00:06:16.470> be<00:06:16.500> so<00:06:17.040> we'll<00:06:17.160> do<00:06:17.250> this

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
where they should be so we'll do this

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.210 
where they should be so we'll do this
test<00:06:17.610> again<00:06:17.760> when<00:06:18.660> we<00:06:18.720> get<00:06:18.870> into<00:06:18.990> a<00:06:19.220> full

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
test again when we get into a full

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.700 
test again when we get into a full
coverage<00:06:20.730> zone<00:06:21.000> i<00:06:21.240> should<00:06:21.450> say<00:06:21.690> give<00:06:22.410> you<00:06:22.530> guys

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
coverage zone i should say give you guys

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.190 
coverage zone i should say give you guys
a<00:06:22.740> better<00:06:23.040> idea<00:06:23.190> of<00:06:23.370> how<00:06:23.520> fastest<00:06:24.150> 4G<00:06:24.510> LTE<00:06:24.660> is<00:06:24.930> I

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
a better idea of how fastest 4G LTE is I

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.690 
a better idea of how fastest 4G LTE is I
mean<00:06:25.530> that's<00:06:25.590> still<00:06:25.860> faster<00:06:26.280> than<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:26.580> know

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
mean that's still faster than you know

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.000 
mean that's still faster than you know
your<00:06:26.880> 3g<00:06:27.360> let's<00:06:27.990> just<00:06:28.140> run<00:06:28.290> it<00:06:28.410> one<00:06:28.590> more<00:06:28.770> time

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
your 3g let's just run it one more time

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.460 
your 3g let's just run it one more time
just<00:06:29.340> for<00:06:29.640> fun<00:06:30.120> oh<00:06:32.450> I<00:06:33.450> would<00:06:34.290> say<00:06:34.380> it's

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
just for fun oh I would say it's

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.630 
just for fun oh I would say it's
probably<00:06:34.500> not<00:06:34.830> doing<00:06:34.980> well<00:06:35.190> because<00:06:35.340> it's

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
probably not doing well because it's

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.210 
probably not doing well because it's
pulling<00:06:35.940> up<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.120> Wichita<00:06:36.660> Kansas<00:06:37.170> let's<00:06:38.100> go

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
pulling up a Wichita Kansas let's go

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.290 
pulling up a Wichita Kansas let's go
ahead<00:06:38.280> and<00:06:38.370> stop<00:06:38.940> that<00:06:41.060> sorry<00:06:42.060> about<00:06:42.150> this

find speeds like that on anybody else
tablet<00:07:18.470> it's<00:07:18.860> faster<00:07:19.160> than<00:07:19.280> most<00:07:19.370> people's

Wi-Fi<00:07:30.320> version<00:07:30.640> I<00:07:31.640> do<00:07:32.360> believe<00:07:32.660> this<00:07:32.810> is<00:07:32.870> 600

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830

aankhon<00:07:34.310> to<00:07:34.640> your<00:07:34.820> contract<00:07:35.920> you<00:07:36.920> know<00:07:37.040> that's

aankhon to your contract you know that's

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.830 
aankhon to your contract you know that's
sort<00:07:37.340> of<00:07:37.430> a<00:07:37.520> steep<00:07:37.760> price<00:07:37.790> but<00:07:38.300> we'll<00:07:38.480> see<00:07:38.630> it's

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
sort of a steep price but we'll see it's

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.660 
sort of a steep price but we'll see it's
worth<00:07:38.990> it<00:07:39.200> once<00:07:39.380> we<00:07:39.530> do<00:07:39.890> a<00:07:39.920> full<00:07:40.160> walk<00:07:40.370> throat

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.670 
worth it once we do a full walk throat

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.310 
worth it once we do a full walk throat
