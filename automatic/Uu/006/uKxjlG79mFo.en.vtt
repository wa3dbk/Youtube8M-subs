 ğŸ¦„ğŸ‘‹ Hello my nice people welcome to the channel once again in today's video I bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.150
 makeup that I wear with this palette of maybelline that is called 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.789
 The Nudes this is a super basic palette and 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 super easy to use so if you are from people who 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 they are starting to play with shadows I highly recommend that palette and can 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.810
 to be interested in the money but to stay half 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.840
 We begin by applying a test to stop skin tone and for this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.160
 makeup does not want more 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.560
 We continue with the base when I maquillo to leave at night I make sure that the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.060
 base I do not have sunscreen so my face is not white in the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 photographs I will apply the base with a brush and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 then I will blur it with the house to give it a more finished 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.049
 I'm going to apply a concealer and it's also blurred because of the attitude 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.030
 to close the base and the corrector I'm using a powder transfers 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.720
 to define and do not formulate face I am using the pronounced in the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.020
 entity 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.019
 and to give color and luminosity to the face I am using a rumor 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.590
 will now we continue as they are I will start by applying a beige color 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.989
 based on the whole eyelid very logical a light brown to give 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.769
 dimension as 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.500
 this is a coffee one darker eye of the previous one and I'm going to apply it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.060
 immediate out 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.690
 now to give the shape to an armed man was applying a dark coffee 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:40.850
 just in the corner of the eye and we would end it somewhere in the part 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.709
 inside of the eye apply this color chance and with a little bit of brightness a 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.660
 center only spears 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.220
 with this color I will illuminate the gesture of the eyebrow and the lower part of the eye 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.430
 with a black apex covers the water line above and already 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.050
 Now to add a touch of color I'm going to use a green color only 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.489
 in the lower part of the eye 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 we continue with the hardest part taught 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.830
 for this fear I will use an eyeliner in a hymn of milani 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.910
 and let's not forget our eyelashes 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.689
 e false eyelashes are optional 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.239
 who want a more dramatic look 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.139
 This is the look with a natural area but if we want a little more 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.379
 color and we put a pizzi colon and you look at the flight through this has been all 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.789
 for today's video I hope you liked the greetings of the devil in 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.529
