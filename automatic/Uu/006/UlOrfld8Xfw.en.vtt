of<00:00:08.059> CPUs<00:00:08.630> named<00:00:08.900> ivy<00:00:09.350> bridge<00:00:09.700> there's<00:00:10.700> been<00:00:10.850> a

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
of CPUs named ivy bridge there's been a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.100 
of CPUs named ivy bridge there's been a
lot<00:00:11.059> of<00:00:11.090> discussion<00:00:11.629> and<00:00:11.719> buzz<00:00:11.900> surrounding

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
lot of discussion and buzz surrounding

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.529 
lot of discussion and buzz surrounding
Ivy<00:00:12.680> Bridge<00:00:12.920> but<00:00:13.699> some<00:00:13.969> of<00:00:14.059> that<00:00:14.209> discussion

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
Ivy Bridge but some of that discussion

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.590 
Ivy Bridge but some of that discussion
has<00:00:14.750> been<00:00:14.869> very<00:00:15.080> technically<00:00:15.559> involved<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.029> in

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
has been very technically involved so in

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.510 
has been very technically involved so in
the<00:00:17.690> next<00:00:17.779> couple<00:00:18.050> of<00:00:18.170> minutes<00:00:18.260> or<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:19.430> are

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
the next couple of minutes or so we are

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.279 
the next couple of minutes or so we are
going<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:19.760> discuss<00:00:19.880> in<00:00:20.270> simple<00:00:20.449> terms<00:00:20.690> what<00:00:21.169> is

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
going to discuss in simple terms what is

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.650 
going to discuss in simple terms what is
so<00:00:21.410> important<00:00:21.980> about<00:00:22.070> ivy<00:00:22.519> bridge<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:22.970> who

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
so important about ivy bridge and who

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.370 
so important about ivy bridge and who

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
Ivy Bridge is based in the sandy bridge

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.880 
Ivy Bridge is based in the sandy bridge
architecture<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:30.380> means<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
architecture this means that the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.530 
architecture this means that the
building<00:00:31.279> blocks<00:00:31.519> that<00:00:31.640> make<00:00:31.789> up<00:00:31.970> both<00:00:32.210> lines

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
building blocks that make up both lines

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.080 
building blocks that make up both lines
of<00:00:32.720> CPUs<00:00:33.170> are<00:00:33.320> very<00:00:33.500> similar<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:34.760> can<00:00:34.940> see

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
of CPUs are very similar and you can see

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.780 
of CPUs are very similar and you can see
that<00:00:35.120> here<00:00:35.560> for<00:00:36.560> example<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.400> actual

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
that here for example the actual

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.660 
that here for example the actual
arrangement<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.330> cores<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:40.100> shared<00:00:40.400> l3

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
arrangement of the cores the shared l3

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.510 
arrangement of the cores the shared l3
cache<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.630> even<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.500> memory<00:00:42.620> controller<00:00:42.890> are

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
cache and even the memory controller are

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.410 
cache and even the memory controller are
very<00:00:44.150> similar<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.670> most<00:00:46.850> significant

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
very similar the most significant

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.000 
very similar the most significant
difference<00:00:47.810> which<00:00:47.990> is<00:00:48.140> not<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.530> easy<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:48.800> see

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
difference which is not so easy to see

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.510 
difference which is not so easy to see
however<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.880> size<00:00:50.330> with<00:00:50.570> transistors<00:00:51.520> the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
however is the size with transistors the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.220 
however is the size with transistors the
size<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.030> transistors<00:00:53.480> in<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.630> CPU<00:00:54.050> is

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
size of the transistors in the CPU is

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.900 
size of the transistors in the CPU is
very<00:00:54.530> important<00:00:55.100> because<00:00:55.370> there<00:00:55.610> are<00:00:55.730> two

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
very important because there are two

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.050 
very important because there are two
basic<00:00:56.270> ways<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.840> make<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.990> CPU<00:00:57.470> faster<00:00:58.010> are<00:00:58.220> the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
basic ways to make a CPU faster are the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.510 
basic ways to make a CPU faster are the
speed<00:00:59.330> up<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.690> transistor<00:01:00.320> or<00:01:00.470> add<00:01:01.220> more

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
speed up the transistor or add more

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.749 
speed up the transistor or add more
transistors<00:01:01.970> by<00:01:02.300> making<00:01:02.600> them<00:01:02.690> smaller

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:03.759 
transistors by making them smaller

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.370 
transistors by making them smaller
pushing<00:01:04.759> up<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:04.970> speed<00:01:05.330> however<00:01:05.509> is<00:01:06.140> like

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
pushing up the speed however is like

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.990 
pushing up the speed however is like
rubbing<00:01:06.650> out<00:01:06.770> revving<00:01:07.159> up<00:01:07.280> your<00:01:07.310> car<00:01:07.640> engine

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
rubbing out revving up your car engine

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.849 
rubbing out revving up your car engine
there<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.869> limit<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.229> how<00:01:09.259> far<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:09.649> can<00:01:09.829> push

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
there is a limit to how far you can push

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.399 
there is a limit to how far you can push
a<00:01:10.039> car<00:01:10.340> engine<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.719> will<00:01:11.960> always<00:01:12.170> produce

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
a car engine and it will always produce

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.999 
a car engine and it will always produce
more<00:01:12.859> heat<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.939> same<00:01:14.210> goes<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.630> CPUs<00:01:15.109> heat<00:01:15.829> is

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
more heat the same goes for CPUs heat is

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.039 
more heat the same goes for CPUs heat is
a<00:01:16.070> real<00:01:16.249> issue<00:01:16.520> with<00:01:16.789> CPUs<00:01:17.210> because<00:01:17.509> processes

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
a real issue with CPUs because processes

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.239 
a real issue with CPUs because processes
are<00:01:18.170> being<00:01:18.350> pushed<00:01:18.560> into<00:01:18.740> smaller<00:01:19.130> and

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
are being pushed into smaller and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.489 
are being pushed into smaller and
smaller<00:01:19.369> cases<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.719> getting<00:01:20.929> rid<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.229> that

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
smaller cases so getting rid of that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.099 
smaller cases so getting rid of that
heat<00:01:21.770> can<00:01:21.920> become<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> real<00:01:22.520> problem<00:01:23.109> that

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
heat can become a real problem that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.349 
heat can become a real problem that
leaves<00:01:24.469> drinking<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.100> transistor<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.880> is
