our ends you know I mean that wasn't
what<00:00:20.210> was<00:00:20.390> said<00:00:20.630> but<00:00:20.689> we're<00:00:21.289> going<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.470> do<00:00:21.560> our

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590

what was said but we're going to do our
workforce<00:00:22.130> redesign<00:00:23.020> which<00:00:24.020> well<00:00:24.380> what<00:00:24.650> does

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
workforce redesign which well what does

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.279 
workforce redesign which well what does
that<00:00:24.919> mean<00:00:25.220> when<00:00:26.000> they<00:00:26.119> talk<00:00:26.329> about<00:00:26.360> tasks<00:00:27.140> and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
that mean when they talk about tasks and

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.279 
that mean when they talk about tasks and
that<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:27.680> our<00:00:27.860> concern<00:00:28.340> again<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.939> that<00:00:29.289> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
great experiment that we're going into

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.410 
great experiment that we're going into
that<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:15.950> has<00:02:16.220> not<00:02:16.489> been<00:02:16.790> tried<00:02:17.090> elsewhere

that really has not been tried elsewhere

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.800 
that really has not been tried elsewhere
and<00:02:17.989> we're<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.680> research<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.370> very<00:02:19.430> clear

our end staff have better outcomes that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.750 
our end staff have better outcomes that

coming up nurses are upset because they

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.640 
coming up nurses are upset because they

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
think that every one of them could be

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.619 
think that every one of them could be
laid<00:04:12.980> off<00:04:13.010> sometime<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.969> the<00:04:14.090> next<00:04:14.239> year<00:04:14.599> or

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
laid off sometime in the next year or

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.199 
laid off sometime in the next year or
two<00:04:14.810> or<00:04:15.169> three<00:04:15.439> but<00:04:16.100> again<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.459> guess<00:04:16.850> my

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
two or three but again I guess my

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.240 
two or three but again I guess my
concern<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.169> have<00:04:18.440> much<00:04:18.829> more<00:04:19.040> of<00:04:19.100> a

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
concern is is just have much more of a

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.039 
concern is is just have much more of a
pliant<00:04:19.790> health<00:04:20.030> care<00:04:20.269> system<00:04:20.690> when<00:04:20.840> there's
