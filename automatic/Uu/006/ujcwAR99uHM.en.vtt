00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
one thing that we have not touched on is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
one thing that we have not touched on is
the<00:02:43.430> fact<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.700> all<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.239> research<00:02:44.570> deals

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the fact that all of this research deals

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.110 
the fact that all of this research deals
with<00:02:45.110> heterosexual<00:02:45.410> couples<00:02:46.250> very<00:02:46.610> curious

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
with heterosexual couples very curious

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.479 
with heterosexual couples very curious
to<00:02:47.150> find<00:02:47.390> out<00:02:47.510> whether<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.680> take<00:02:49.130> those

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
to find out whether if you take those

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.940 
to find out whether if you take those
gender<00:02:49.820> norms<00:02:50.060> away<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:51.080> just<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.410> happens

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
gender norms away if it just so happens

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.650 
gender norms away if it just so happens
that<00:02:52.040> couples<00:02:52.430> tend<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.510> more

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
that couples tend to have a more

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.360 
that couples tend to have a more
dominant<00:02:54.140> driver<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.860> guess<00:02:55.040> what<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> want

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
dominant driver so I guess what I want

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.090 
dominant driver so I guess what I want
to<00:02:55.430> know<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.910> who's<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.900> chauffeur<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.830> your

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100
