knitting cotton you can see that I have

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.880 
knitting cotton you can see that I have
four<00:00:25.320> there<00:00:25.619> four<00:00:26.279> gives<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.730> nice<00:00:26.939> full<00:00:27.330> fringe

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
four there four gives a nice full fringe
to<00:00:28.890> start<00:00:29.160> off<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.760> need<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.300> create<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to start off with we need to create a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.310 
to start off with we need to create a
slipknot

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
slipknot

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
slipknot
so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> loop<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> turn<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> loop

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so I make a loop like that turn the loop

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
so I make a loop like that turn the loop
over<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> pull<00:00:35.130> those<00:00:35.700> threads<00:00:36.120> through<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
over and pull those threads through the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
over and pull those threads through the
loop<00:00:38.180> today<00:00:39.180> I'll<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.360> using<00:00:39.750> two<00:00:40.850> double

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
loop today I'll be using two double

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.549 
loop today I'll be using two double
ended<00:00:42.149> needles<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.960> reason<00:00:43.230> why<00:00:43.379> I'm

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
ended needles the only reason why I'm

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
ended needles the only reason why I'm
using<00:00:43.739> double<00:00:44.129> ended<00:00:44.370> needles<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> because

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
using double ended needles is because

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.069 
using double ended needles is because
they<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.480> short

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
they are short

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
they are short
I<00:00:46.160> put<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.700> Slipknot<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> left<00:00:48.930> needle

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I put the Slipknot on to the left needle

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.970 
I put the Slipknot on to the left needle
and<00:00:49.440> tighten<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.980> insert

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and tighten it a little then I insert

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.760 
and tighten it a little then I insert
the<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:54.059> needle<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> front<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the right needle into the front of that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060

like<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.990> again<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.430> take<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> yarn<00:01:08.880> around

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
like that again I take the yarn around

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the Left needle we're going to need a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.050 
the Left needle we're going to need a
total<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> nine<00:01:18.750> stitches<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.340> I'll<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.759> keep

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
total of nine stitches so I'll just keep

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
total of nine stitches so I'll just keep
doing<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> same<00:01:21.840> thing<00:01:22.170> until<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.890> nine

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
doing the same thing until we have nine

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.359 
doing the same thing until we have nine
I'm<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:24.270> metal<00:01:24.810> needles<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:26.009> metal

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I'm using metal needles because metal

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.730 
I'm using metal needles because metal
needles<00:01:26.759> won't<00:01:27.450> break<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.530> using

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
needles won't break when you're using

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
needles won't break when you're using
four<00:01:29.100> strands<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> knitting<00:01:29.970> cotton<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.509> we

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
four strands of knitting cotton as we

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.120 
four strands of knitting cotton as we
are<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.159> no<00:01:32.520> give<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
are here there is no give and so it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880 
are here there is no give and so it
means<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.570> used<00:01:36.810> plastic<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.500> bamboo

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
means that if you used plastic or bamboo

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
means that if you used plastic or bamboo
they'd<00:01:38.189> break<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
they'd break we don't want that to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.219 
they'd break we don't want that to
happen<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:40.950> why<00:01:41.189> we're<00:01:41.369> using<00:01:41.460> metal

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
happen so that's why we're using metal

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.539 
happen so that's why we're using metal
so<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> keeping<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:44.009> adding<00:01:44.310> stitches

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so I'm just keeping on adding stitches

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.899 
so I'm just keeping on adding stitches
until<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.420> nine<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.920> eight<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.880> we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
until I get nine now I have eight so we

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
until I get nine now I have eight so we
just<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:50.180> okay<00:01:51.320> there's<00:01:52.320> our<00:01:52.530> nine

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
we also need to bring our thread around

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.630 
we also need to bring our thread around
the<00:02:09.209> front<00:02:09.690> end<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.800> needle<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the front end of the right needle and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730 
the front end of the right needle and
what<00:02:12.540> that's<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
what that's going to do is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.270 
what that's going to do is
it's<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.250> increase<00:02:15.290> one<00:02:16.290> before<00:02:17.130> we

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's going to increase one before we

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.360 
it's going to increase one before we
then<00:02:17.460> decrease<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:18.900> take<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> thread

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
then decrease so we take the thread

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.270 
then decrease so we take the thread
around<00:02:20.700> though<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.270> needle<00:02:21.570> there<00:02:22.280> knit

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
around though that needle there knit

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.670 
around though that needle there knit
through<00:02:23.580> both<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.880> those<00:02:24.210> stitches<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
through both of those stitches and you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.560 
through both of those stitches and you
can<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:25.980> we've<00:02:26.160> increased<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.390> we've

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
can see we've increased and then we've

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.780 
can see we've increased and then we've
decreased<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.950> end<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> same

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
decreased so we end up with the same

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.420 
decreased so we end up with the same
number<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> stitches<00:02:30.860> now<00:02:31.860> we're<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.250> to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
number of stitches now we're going to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.250 
number of stitches now we're going to
knit<00:02:32.610> one

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
knit one

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
knit one
once<00:02:34.260> again<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:35.280> bring<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> yarn<00:02:36.030> forward

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
once again we bring the yarn forward

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.890 
once again we bring the yarn forward
that<00:02:37.020> will<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.590> increase<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.940> insert<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that will be our increase we insert the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.000 
that will be our increase we insert the
needle<00:02:40.260> into<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.770> next<00:02:41.190> two<00:02:41.610> stitches<00:02:43.010> knit

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
knitted days we can imagine that there's

such as with scallops you'll need extra

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
to ease into those curves we can see

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.340 
to ease into those curves we can see
quite<00:04:52.670> clearly<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:53.510> there's<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.990> openwork

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
quite clearly that there's the openwork

quite clearly that there's the openwork
at<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.770> edge<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.880> ridges<00:04:56.390> more<00:04:57.140> openwork<00:04:57.710> and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
at the edge the ridges more openwork and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.200 
at the edge the ridges more openwork and
then<00:04:58.130> another<00:04:58.370> Ridge<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:01.430> last<00:05:01.670> step<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:01.970> we

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
then another Ridge the last step that we

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.080 
then another Ridge the last step that we
need<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.480> do<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.960> cast<00:05:03.200> off<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.790> do<00:05:04.940> this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
need to do is to cast off to do this

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.320 
need to do is to cast off to do this
we'll<00:05:05.300> do<00:05:05.420> it<00:05:05.540> quite<00:05:05.810> loosely<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.330> it

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
we'll do it quite loosely so that it

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.970 
we'll do it quite loosely so that it
doesn't<00:05:08.660> end<00:05:08.810> up<00:05:08.900> being<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.170> real<00:05:09.350> tight<00:05:09.620> cast

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
doesn't end up being a real tight cast

longer there pull the thread through

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.490 
longer there pull the thread through
those<00:06:19.250> last<00:06:19.700> stitches<00:06:20.000> there<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:20.930> we've<00:06:21.290> got

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
those last stitches there and we've got

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
get rid of the needles now now imagine

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.930 
get rid of the needles now now imagine
that<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.540> are<00:06:26.570> wearing<00:06:27.050> some<00:06:27.770> pantyhose<00:06:28.220> and

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
that you are wearing some pantyhose and

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.470 
that you are wearing some pantyhose and
you<00:06:29.930> get<00:06:30.140> a<00:06:30.320> ladder<00:06:30.740> in<00:06:31.310> your<00:06:31.520> pantyhose<00:06:31.970> and

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
you get a ladder in your pantyhose and

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.870 
you get a ladder in your pantyhose and
that's<00:06:32.780> what<00:06:33.080> we're<00:06:33.260> going<00:06:33.470> to<00:06:33.590> do<00:06:33.830> here<00:06:34.310> with

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
that's what we're going to do here with

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.159 
that's what we're going to do here with
these<00:06:35.150> stitches<00:06:35.480> here<00:06:35.990> we<00:06:36.320> are<00:06:36.350> going<00:06:36.860> to

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
these stitches here we are going to

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.309 
these stitches here we are going to
make<00:06:37.289> the<00:06:37.650> stitches<00:06:38.219> run<00:06:38.779> and<00:06:39.779> in<00:06:39.960> doing<00:06:40.169> so

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
make the stitches run and in doing so

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.269 
make the stitches run and in doing so
that's<00:06:41.099> how<00:06:41.490> we<00:06:41.879> form<00:06:42.240> our<00:06:42.569> fringe<00:06:43.129> so<00:06:44.129> we're

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
that's how we form our fringe so we're

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.629 
that's how we form our fringe so we're
just<00:06:44.310> undoing<00:06:44.999> them<00:06:45.379> and<00:06:46.909> undoing<00:06:48.080> and

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
just undoing them and undoing and
