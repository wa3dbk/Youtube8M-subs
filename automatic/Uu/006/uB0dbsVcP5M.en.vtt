to<00:01:18.060> internet<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.950> might<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.610> work<00:01:20.909> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to internet and it might don't work in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.980 
to internet and it might don't work in
that<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.759> at<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.420> should<00:01:24.479> use

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that way so at that time you should use

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
that way so at that time you should use
Jeanette<00:01:25.860> key<00:01:26.040> feature<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> this
