you have a slightly different key fob
Hardware<00:01:18.520> measurement<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.979> want<00:01:21.130> to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
Hardware measurement then you want to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.060 
Hardware measurement then you want to
place<00:01:21.400> your<00:01:21.450> stiffer<00:01:22.450> piece<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:23.170> interfacing

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
place your stiffer piece of interfacing

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.999 
place your stiffer piece of interfacing
and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.960> piece<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.290> fleece<00:01:26.439> on<00:01:26.619> top<00:01:26.830> I

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
and then the piece of fleece on top I

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.730 
and then the piece of fleece on top I
just<00:01:27.280> like<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.790> cushy<00:01:28.750> kind<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.380> appearance

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
just like the cushy kind of appearance

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.890 
just like the cushy kind of appearance
that<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.070> fusible<00:01:30.400> fleece<00:01:30.640> gives<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.750> this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
that the fusible fleece gives to this

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.710 
that the fusible fleece gives to this
look<00:01:32.790> obviously<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.210> kind<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.540> play

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
look obviously you can kind of play

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.480 
look obviously you can kind of play
around<00:01:34.750> with<00:01:35.049> it<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.380> adjust<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
around with it and adjust the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.830 
around with it and adjust the
interfacing<00:01:37.210> as<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:38.110> know<00:01:38.229> as<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.740> liked<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
interfacing as you know as you liked so

this is where you can make any
adjustments<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:07.570> sure<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.229> has<00:02:08.410> a

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
adjustments make sure that it has a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
machine and I just sort of ballpark it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640 
machine and I just sort of ballpark it
about<00:02:46.269> an<00:02:46.360> eighth<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.630> an<00:02:46.720> inch<00:02:46.810> from<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.260> side

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
about an eighth of an inch from the side

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.949 
about an eighth of an inch from the side
you<00:02:47.860> want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.070> make<00:02:48.220> sure<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.519> catch<00:02:48.959> that

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
you want to make sure to catch that

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.170 
you want to make sure to catch that
folded<00:02:50.410> fabric<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.130> pressed<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:52.030> make

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
folded fabric that you pressed to make

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.900 
folded fabric that you pressed to make
sure<00:02:52.330> everything<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.690> nice<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:52.989> sealed<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.920> use

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
sure everything is nice and sealed I use

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.729 
sure everything is nice and sealed I use
a<00:02:54.940> slightly<00:02:55.390> larger<00:02:55.690> stitch<00:02:56.110> length<00:02:56.380> about<00:02:56.680> a

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
a slightly larger stitch length about a

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.800 
a slightly larger stitch length about a
three<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.530> coordinating<00:02:59.530> thread<00:03:00.660> then<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.750> do

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
three and coordinating thread then I do

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.000 
three and coordinating thread then I do
the<00:03:01.959> same<00:03:02.140> thing<00:03:02.320> on<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> other<00:03:02.590> side<00:03:02.739> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
the same thing on the other side and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
the same thing on the other side and
altogether<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.250> used<00:03:06.640> four<00:03:07.000> different

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
altogether I used four different

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.240 
altogether I used four different
stitches<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.190> way<00:03:09.220> down<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.650> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
stitches going all the way down so just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.039 
stitches going all the way down so just
try<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.579> out<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.090> your<00:03:13.299> machine<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.690> see

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
what works best now go over to the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.500 
what works best now go over to the
ironing<00:03:18.579> board<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.880> give<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> nice<00:03:19.239> good

press and here you can kind of see what

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.310 
press and here you can kind of see what
mine<00:03:23.320> looks<00:03:23.350> like

mine looks like

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.260 
mine looks like
next<00:03:26.320> thing<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.590> want<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.370> trim<00:03:28.060> off

your ends now what I like to do when

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.970 
your ends now what I like to do when
applying<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.110> hardware<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.650> double<00:03:32.950> check

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
applying the hardware is double check

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.610 
applying the hardware is double check
the<00:03:33.310> size<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.910> then<00:03:34.060> pinch<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.140> slightly

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the size and then pinch it slightly

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.430 
the size and then pinch it slightly
closed<00:03:36.280> ahead<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.000> time<00:03:37.210> it<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:38.050> makes<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
closed ahead of time it just makes it a

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.650 
closed ahead of time it just makes it a
little<00:03:38.530> bit<00:03:38.740> easier<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.700> stays<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.360> fabric

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
little bit easier it stays on the fabric

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.640 
little bit easier it stays on the fabric
a<00:03:40.720> little<00:03:40.930> bit<00:03:41.020> better<00:03:41.140> when<00:03:41.350> you're<00:03:41.470> trying

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
a little bit better when you're trying

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.950 
a little bit better when you're trying
to<00:03:41.890> finish<00:03:42.070> pinching<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.180> all<00:03:43.360> together<00:03:43.660> with

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
to finish pinching it all together with

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.660 
to finish pinching it all together with
those<00:03:44.110> needle<00:03:44.380> nose<00:03:44.560> pliers<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.190> use<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> piece

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
those needle nose pliers and use a piece

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.090 
those needle nose pliers and use a piece
of<00:03:45.700> batting<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.080> don't<00:03:47.230> scratch<00:03:47.590> any

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
of batting so that you don't scratch any
