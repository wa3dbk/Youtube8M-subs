00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
I say that they don't move they don't
move<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.439> nothing<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.829> moving

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
move so as you can see nothing is moving

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.170 
move so as you can see nothing is moving
and<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> imagine<00:01:45.450> how

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
and can you imagine how

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.780 
and can you imagine how
surely<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.830> for<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.100> side<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.670> know

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
surely that is and for the side you know

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.480 
surely that is and for the side you know
there's<00:01:52.390> no<00:01:52.920> bouncing<00:01:53.920> no<00:01:53.950> strain<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.310> your

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there's no bouncing no strain on your

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.790 
there's no bouncing no strain on your
back<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.000> know<00:01:55.150> anything<00:01:55.600> like<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.200> you

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
back you know anything like that so you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.260 
back you know anything like that so you
know<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.220> bras<00:01:57.430> they<00:01:57.670> do<00:01:57.730> come<00:01:58.120> up

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
know with the bras they do come up

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.940 
know with the bras they do come up
higher<00:01:58.510> as<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.930> can<00:01:59.080> see<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.260> am<00:01:59.500> wearing<00:01:59.650> this

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
higher as you can see I am wearing this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.430 
higher as you can see I am wearing this
shirt<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.270> does<00:02:01.390> come<00:02:01.630> up<00:02:01.660> above<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
shirt and it does come up above the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.640 
shirt and it does come up above the
neckline<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:04.240> because<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.470> not<00:02:05.619> only

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
neckline and that's because it not only

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.950 
neckline and that's because it not only
has<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.040> lift<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.610> bust<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.570> has<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.869> hold

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
has to lift the bust but it has to hold

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.660 
has to lift the bust but it has to hold
it<00:02:08.140> down<00:02:08.289> too<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:08.920> doesn't<00:02:09.160> come<00:02:09.310> popping

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
it down too so it doesn't come popping

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.320 
it down too so it doesn't come popping
at<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.850> top

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
at the top

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720 
at the top
so<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.200> little<00:02:11.410> bit<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.709> extra<00:02:11.950> coverage<00:02:12.250> is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
so a little bit of extra coverage is

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.750 
so a little bit of extra coverage is
there<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> reason<00:02:13.810> also<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> back<00:02:15.490> as

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
there for a reason also in the back as

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.400 
there for a reason also in the back as
you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.360> does<00:02:16.540> come<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.810> pretty<00:02:17.170> high

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you can see it does come up pretty high

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can see it does come up pretty high
and<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.030> has<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.780> that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and that all this has to do with in that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.020 
and that all this has to do with in that
of<00:02:20.080> support<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.830> need<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.190> give<00:02:21.400> your

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
of support that you need to give your

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.590 
of support that you need to give your
larger<00:02:22.360> breasts<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> amount
