00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
think so it's pretty much the same

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.700 
think so it's pretty much the same
question<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.449> most<00:00:18.630> part<00:00:18.779> my

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
question and for the most part my

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.179 
question and for the most part my
response<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.609> don't<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:22.010> say<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
response is don't do it I say that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.460 
response is don't do it I say that
because<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.359> these<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.600> people<00:00:24.990> most

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
because you know these are people most

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.779 
because you know these are people most
of<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.680> who<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.460> any

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

experience in the business you know you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589

might have to fill out some claims or
maybe<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> buy<00:00:54.510> software<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> handle<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.770> lot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
maybe you buy software to handle a lot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
maybe you buy software to handle a lot
of<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.030> when<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.600> send<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> medical

bill if you're lucky eighty to ninety
five<00:01:01.770> percent<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.090> paid<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.809> because

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
five percent will get paid just because

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
five percent will get paid just because

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
being able to figure out why those bills

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.980 
being able to figure out why those bills
were<00:01:16.950> paid<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.610> being<00:01:17.820> able<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.689> what

physician or the insurance company so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.630 
physician or the insurance company so
there's<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.810> need<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.640> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there's a lot that you need to know that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.660 
there's a lot that you need to know that
someone<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:30.869> experience<00:01:31.680> probably

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
someone with some experience probably

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
someone with some experience probably
doesn't<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.180> thing<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.840> want<00:01:34.229> a

doesn't know that thing if you want a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 
doesn't know that thing if you want a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
true learning curve it'll probably take

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
true learning curve it'll probably take
you<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.240> least<00:01:36.270> six<00:01:36.600> months<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> year<00:01:37.079> just
