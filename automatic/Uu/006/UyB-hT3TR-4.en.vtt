problem with primer cane blackberries is
you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.460> primer<00:00:45.120> cane<00:00:45.360> blackberries<00:00:45.960> are

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you know primer cane blackberries are

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
you know primer cane blackberries are
the<00:00:46.260> blackberries<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.070> autumn<00:00:47.700> bearing

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the blackberries like autumn bearing

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
the blackberries like autumn bearing
raspberries<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.050> cut<00:00:49.410> them<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.739> 100

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
raspberries you can cut them down 100

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
raspberries you can cut them down 100
percent<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.239> making<00:00:51.989> new<00:00:52.140> shoots<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
percent they are making new shoots in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
percent they are making new shoots in
spring<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> same<00:00:54.000> shoots<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
spring and on the same shoots in the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
spring and on the same shoots in the
same<00:00:54.780> year<00:00:55.110> they're<00:00:55.440> making<00:00:55.800> blooms<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
same year they're making blooms and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
same year they're making blooms and
fruits<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.360> autumn<00:00:58.289> bearing<00:00:58.680> raspberries

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
fruits like autumn bearing raspberries

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
fruits like autumn bearing raspberries
so<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> trait<00:01:01.859> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so now we have this trait in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
so now we have this trait in
blackberries<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> problem<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
blackberries the problem is that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
blackberries the problem is that
blackberries<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.379> raspberries<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
blackberries are not raspberries the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.320 
blackberries are not raspberries the
ripening<00:01:06.060> later<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:09.000> time

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
ripening later and they need more time

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
ripening later and they need more time
to<00:01:09.630> ripen<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.500> need<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.119> become

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to ripen they need more time to become

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.710 
to ripen they need more time to become
from<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> bloom<00:01:13.200> also<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> fruit<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:15.210> 30<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
from a bloom also a fruit about 30 to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
from a bloom also a fruit about 30 to
50%<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> problem

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
50% more time and this is the problem

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280 
50% more time and this is the problem
when<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.320> our<00:01:19.560> climate<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.310> UK<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.450> Holland

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when we in our climate in UK in Holland

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
when we in our climate in UK in Holland
in<00:01:22.500> Germany<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.460> Switzerland<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.210> Austria

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
in Germany and Switzerland and Austria

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.080 
in Germany and Switzerland and Austria
when<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.280> varieties<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.060> have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
when we don't have varieties which have

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
when we don't have varieties which have
really<00:01:27.810> ripe<00:01:28.049> fruit<00:01:28.549> beginning<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> middle

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
really ripe fruit beginning and middle

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
really ripe fruit beginning and middle
of<00:01:30.090> August<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.320> never<00:01:31.530> become<00:01:31.799> ripe

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
of August they will never become ripe

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
of August they will never become ripe
then<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.210> end<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.750> precious<00:01:34.020> full<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
then you end up with precious full of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.670 
then you end up with precious full of
green<00:01:35.070> fruit<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.150> ripening<00:01:36.720> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
green fruit which are not ripening so

numbers which we are beginning to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.599 
numbers which we are beginning to
multiplicate<00:02:47.379> which<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.799> really<00:02:48.129> working<00:02:48.340> we
