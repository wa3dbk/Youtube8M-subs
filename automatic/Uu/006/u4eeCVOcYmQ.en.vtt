00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.860
 so you understand how we will 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.290
 what classes are in this 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.950
 I'll show you now one basic 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.500
 element 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.720
 could protion better and most importantly in 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.580
 illusoriness is isolation is when 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.200
 directly moving one part 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.080
 body the other part stands still that is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.680
 hand arm brush brush and head head 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.820
 body shoulder turn on chest and so on and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.570
 Now we will analyze a small 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.090
 a piece of the robot and it consists of the following 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.479
 pieces put your hands wide 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.410
 then stand up and straighten your back 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:42.880
 let's go look leagues of nations 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:45.040
 times two three 4 5 six what i did in 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.500
 principle, nothing here I stand quietly at 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:55.399
 us lean only back now 1 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.420

 6 so that your movement is possible 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.060
