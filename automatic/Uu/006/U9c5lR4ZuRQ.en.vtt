00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 The kickers had to play three matches in a row 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.620
 Offenbach suffered a defeat 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.300
 This negative trend was for rico 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.200
 Schmitt and his boys in Freiburg 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.670
 against their second team at very 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.590
 to stop varied weather 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.199
 Nevertheless, there were positive too 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.859
 reporting from the home of the fc with baris 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.230
 yakut mohammed tahiri and steven from the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.260
 Burg Rico Schmitt has three real coach 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.550
 talents in his ranks the last top 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 had shown performances 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 Nevertheless, all three started from 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.559
 the bank's first chance of the game 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.110
 but then had the host 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 kinoshita misses here in the middle only 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.289
 but the game was almost there 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.989
 22 minutes than 30 minutes were played 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.390
 we say half to the first new one 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.730
 chance for ofc further freekick from 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.250
 benjamin pintol after all freiburgs 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 closing man alexander schwadorf 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 attentive and punishable sure of this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 ability proved the freiburg goalkeeper 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.339
 again only a minute later 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.280
 freistoss brush and again is gay 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.530
 of winners in the air then it should 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 first time become much more dangerous 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.290
 daniel endres is here with his 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.299
 tee nearly prepared 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 then flank from the left in the middle 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.540
 misses the ball just barely the ball arg 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 much more had not happened in either 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.500
 half time one as so often in the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.829
 There were opportunities in the past games 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.140
 for the ofc just not used 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 Two could be at half past two 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 but first again the freiburger 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 marcel wilke first of all clears his mind 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.299
 and then comes Caleb stanko strong for 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.180
 conclusion more but not synonymous 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.670
 then strong ball conquest of the ofc 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.560
 your own goal and then you got it right 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.659
 quickly switched kapek on 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.060
 Theodosiadis 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.780
 he gave up with the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.600
 flank attempt and again alexander wolf 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.960
 a step faster then on the ball 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.009
 eckball pintol and then comes 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.530
 Theodosiadis for this committee is 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.780
 not dangerous and goes into the clouds 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.709
 yes I think who we are before the game 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.010
 made compact are finally 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.250
 then again to play zero 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.160
 We are very praised a few times 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.650
 the ofc had conceded late goals 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.459
 in this season and so some points 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.579
 let lie 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.099
 so today the boy the jboss here 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.440
 alone before daniel endres the first 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.569
 held and then takes over in the morning 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.019
 chalk and wets 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.569
 again a late goal for the guys 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.959
 by coach rico schmitt is on this 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.700
 real chance or some players of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.500
 points shows that was offside 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.370
 umpire not so already 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.690
 now 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.390
 or phase , of course , even so 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.299
 to guard a counterfeit unauthorized 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.269
 but otherwise played well 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.580
 really compact had been defensive 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.280
 yes that was a classic game at 1 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.440
 0 it remained for today's hosts 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.150
 then and that meant the fourth 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.400
 defeat in succession 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.079
 rico schmitt wants one at the goal 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.079
 have seen offside position 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.600
 this is natural 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.170
 regular in the whole big time position 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.930
 after the country break, it goes for 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.910
 the fc at home against hessen kassel 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.220
 the break is for the kickers though 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.580
 shorter than for the rest of the league the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.020
 Partie is on monday the 14th 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.020
 at 20 15
