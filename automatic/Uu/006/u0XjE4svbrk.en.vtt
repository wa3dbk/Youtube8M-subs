think that's a stupid idea
especially<00:01:38.540> because<00:01:38.659> every<00:01:38.960> year<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.770> mean

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
especially because every year so I mean

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.050 
especially because every year so I mean
with<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:41.500> first<00:01:42.500> I'm<00:01:43.189> okay<00:01:43.460> with<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.729> for

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
with that first I'm okay with that for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.850 
with that first I'm okay with that for
the<00:01:44.090> first<00:01:44.360> movie<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:44.990> new<00:01:45.200> trilogy<00:01:45.470> as
