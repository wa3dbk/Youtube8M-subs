00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
is interesting because the unlocked

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.170 
is interesting because the unlocked
model<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.920> comes<00:03:08.159> with<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> sim<00:03:08.790> ejection

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
model actually comes with a sim ejection

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
model actually comes with a sim ejection
tool<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.780> did<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.139> know<00:03:10.349> this<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.799> thought<00:03:11.069> that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
tool I did not know this I thought that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.330 
tool I did not know this I thought that
all<00:03:11.430> US<00:03:11.790> models<00:03:12.420> whether<00:03:12.659> it<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.220> know

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
all US models whether it be the you know

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.879 
all US models whether it be the you know
unlocked<00:03:15.090> model<00:03:15.540> or<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> carrier<00:03:16.200> brand<00:03:16.530> ones

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
unlocked model or the carrier brand ones

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.640 
unlocked model or the carrier brand ones
I<00:03:17.419> figured<00:03:18.419> that<00:03:18.599> they<00:03:18.720> did<00:03:18.900> not<00:03:19.079> they<00:03:19.470> would

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
I figured that they did not they would

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.439 
I figured that they did not they would
not<00:03:19.829> come<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> similar<00:03:20.609> suit<00:03:20.970> ejection

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
not come with a similar suit ejection

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.000 
not come with a similar suit ejection

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.750 
and power the phone on so yeah I was
basically<00:04:46.889> torn<00:04:47.889> between<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.310> 5s<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
basically torn between the 5s and

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.090 
basically torn between the 5s and
another<00:04:49.419> 6<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.110> 5s<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.650> screen<00:04:50.950> is<00:04:51.070> just

another 6 but the 5s the screen is just

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.610 
another 6 but the 5s the screen is just
too<00:04:51.460> small<00:04:51.790> for<00:04:51.970> me<00:04:52.120> nowadays<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.500> know

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
too small for me nowadays so you know

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.070 
too small for me nowadays so you know
again<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.340> got<00:04:54.580> another<00:04:54.820> 6<00:04:55.150> which<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.840> fine

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
again I got another 6 which is fine

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.720 
again I got another 6 which is fine
because<00:04:56.320> this<00:04:56.620> one<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.070> actually<00:04:57.280> built

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
because this one is actually built

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.090 
because this one is actually built
properly<00:04:58.210> which<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.350> think<00:04:59.590> has<00:04:59.740> something<00:04:59.980> to

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100

do<00:05:00.280> with<00:05:00.310> me<00:05:00.610> waiting<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.360> few<00:05:01.600> months<00:05:01.870> because

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
do with me waiting a few months because

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.200
