 today in this video I'll show you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:18.119
 how to move android application on 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.170
 sd card well let's start I'm hearing the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 my for the phone to do what 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 I told you first move the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.970
 applications on the sd card 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 we need to install an application 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.380
 call up to sb we find it on the play 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.380
 store tranche store 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.399
 sorry 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 even then 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 if it is sooner, here it is 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:06.129
 in research 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.129
 let's write to 2 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.400
 sd we try 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.580
 here is the first one coming out app2sd up 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 manager 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.550
 then another one here loads then 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 this operation has exceeded 10 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:42.830
 millions of downloads weighs just a little 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:46.729
 put an average 69 fines speak well of it 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.890
 okay we are here in the upper right corner on 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.910
 install accepts and downloads and we wait 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.910
 that you download 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.600
 I remember that it is free 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.770
 there is also the forever that for a fee 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.080
 installation 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.910
 ok yes it was 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.470
 now we find it up here above 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.100
 we open 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.170
 here it says the various versions thing in the checkout 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.590
 centese small scale these sites does 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.720
 we briefly explain how the saw 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.940
 in English 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.620
 you can also follow mine there 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.190
 asks to accept the license here 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.630
 now he is doing is creating a list 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.230
 of all the applications installed on the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 our cell phone 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.140
 here then 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.430
 but 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 then here you see above there are various 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.440
 movable sections where there are the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.230
 applications that can be put 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.270
 on the card sd pe because there are some 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.180
 applications that developers do not 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.370
 give permission to be in the room 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.540
 on the sd card little idice on sd cards 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.250
 please we have already installed 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 from cards st 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 also only phone with 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.300
 applications that cannot be 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.140
 moved to the new exterior because they are 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.140
 system applications 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.670
 then we go on movable machetes are 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.450
 three ways to do it 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.150
 let's try with 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:07.620
 it here theme windows seven 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.180
 create above here is a video 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.569
 sunday mind the menu 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.769
 settings they think lives this menu 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.030
 even by going to settings 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:22.160
 downloaded applications manages 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.320
 sorry applications then downloaded e 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.560
 let's look for this application now 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.120
 will have to leave this menu to us we must 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.910
 press this button below 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.840
 move on sd cards but i don't know if you see it 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.000
 so much good spots that we give press and 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.000
 luisa by moving to the sd card 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.169
 now when on this button first 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.410
 written scene moves to sd cards now 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:57.270
 spouses on the phone here but I remember you 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.370
 that a psd installs most seems then 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.910
 install sd cards because if you see 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.510
 total on the phone arrived installed 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.190
 However, 60 kilobytes is something that 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:15.620
 although very little will be installed on the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.620
 phone now if we see here 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:28.650
 if we give here on sd cards we find a 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:32.090
 theme windows seven colÃ³n share well 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.050
 that other way practically 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.759
 practically when we download 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.250
 an application from the plexus now vi 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:44.030
 let's show now let's try 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.030
 in the application in something light 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.949
 born hopefully zap example 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.710

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.050
 canalis water 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.589
 I person such applications for example 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.360
