00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's got little triangle on the bottom a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
it's got little triangle on the bottom a
there's<00:01:34.170> three<00:01:34.409> separate<00:01:34.740> limbs<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.189> come

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
there's three separate limbs that come

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
there's three separate limbs that come
up<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.909> almost<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.450> pyramid

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
go real quick here and show you how to
dig<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
dig it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.810 
dig it
find<00:01:49.000> one<00:01:49.330> we<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.720> get<00:01:49.870> out<00:01:50.050> here<00:01:50.820> okay<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
find one we can get out here okay so you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.690 
find one we can get out here okay so you
can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.300> there<00:01:55.510> it<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.920> down<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.160> go<00:01:57.370> the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
can see there it is down you go the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300 
can see there it is down you go the
roots<00:01:58.450> go<00:01:58.870> down<00:01:59.050> maybe<00:01:59.320> four<00:01:59.680> or<00:01:59.800> five<00:02:00.040> inches

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
roots go down maybe four or five inches

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.610 
roots go down maybe four or five inches
and<00:02:00.700> then<00:02:00.820> they<00:02:00.970> they<00:02:01.690> taper<00:02:01.960> off<00:02:02.230> and<00:02:02.410> then<00:02:02.500> go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
and then they they taper off and then go

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.490 
and then they they taper off and then go
in<00:02:02.740> one<00:02:02.920> direction<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.960> just<00:02:05.260> this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
in one direction but I'm just this

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500 
in one direction but I'm just this
estate<00:02:05.920> they<00:02:06.130> get<00:02:06.310> lot<00:02:06.490> much<00:02:06.940> longer<00:02:07.360> than

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
estate they get lot much longer than

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.820 
estate they get lot much longer than
this<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:07.690> I'm<00:02:08.080> just<00:02:08.170> doing<00:02:08.320> real<00:02:08.560> quick<00:02:08.800> just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
this but I'm just doing real quick just

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.190 
this but I'm just doing real quick just
to<00:02:09.100> give<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.340> an<00:02:09.399> idea<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> roots<00:02:11.020> are

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
to give you an idea what the roots are

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.030 
to give you an idea what the roots are
like<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.730> up<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.970> 18<00:02:13.240> feet<00:02:13.480> long<00:02:14.410> or

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
like they can be up to 18 feet long or

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.130 
like they can be up to 18 feet long or
well<00:02:15.520> my<00:02:15.730> nephew<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.180> 18<00:02:16.630> feet<00:02:16.780> long<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
well my nephew going 18 feet long I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.670 
well my nephew going 18 feet long I
couldn't<00:02:17.380> believe<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
couldn't believe it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680 
couldn't believe it
anyway<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.880> take<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.150> part<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
anyway so you just take this part of it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.000 
anyway so you just take this part of it
like<00:02:19.810> now<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.680> whole<00:02:20.920> plant<00:02:21.610> can<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:21.940> used

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like now this whole plant can be used

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.750 
like now this whole plant can be used
but<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.810> generally<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.840> use<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.530> root<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
but I generally just use the root so

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.040 
but I generally just use the root so
there's<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.209> little<00:02:28.480> root<00:02:28.690> there<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:31.050> it's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
there's the little root there and it's

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.860 
there's the little root there and it's
best<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.980> plant<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.870> spring

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
best to get this plant in the spring

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.550 
best to get this plant in the spring
early<00:02:35.680> spring<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.160> late<00:02:36.340> fall<00:02:37.410> there's<00:02:38.410> just

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
early spring or late fall there's just

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.840 
early spring or late fall there's just
more<00:02:38.709> energy<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:42.490> but<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
more energy in it and you know but you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.600 
more energy in it and you know but you
can<00:02:43.030> use<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.300> any<00:02:43.420> time<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.920> you'll<00:02:45.130> know<00:02:45.340> in

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the law the three separate pieces that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.220 
the law the three separate pieces that
come<00:03:13.630> out<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:15.550> about<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.989> kind

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
come out and that's about it so it kind

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.860 
come out and that's about it so it kind
of<00:03:17.290> gives<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.590> an<00:03:17.709> idea<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:19.630> sauce

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
of gives you an idea of what sauce

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.670 
of gives you an idea of what sauce
Aprilia<00:03:20.320> looks<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.310> where<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.640> grows<00:03:21.880> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
Aprilia looks like and where it grows I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.960 
Aprilia looks like and where it grows I
hope<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.040> going<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.310> be<00:03:24.370> beneficial<00:03:24.790> to
