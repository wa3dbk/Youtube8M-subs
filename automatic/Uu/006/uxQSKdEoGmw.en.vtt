open<00:05:20.880> toe<00:05:21.000> police<00:05:21.330> is<00:05:21.570> not<00:05:21.900> as<00:05:22.139> sexy<00:05:22.470> because

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
open toe police is not as sexy because

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.310 
open toe police is not as sexy because
it<00:05:23.550> doesn't<00:05:23.970> shows<00:05:24.150> as<00:05:24.389> much<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.870> your<00:05:24.990> skin's

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
however the site cut from lower to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.520 
however the site cut from lower to
higher<00:05:28.710> would<00:05:29.520> definitely<00:05:30.150> create<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.960> thinner

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
higher would definitely create a thinner

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.620 
higher would definitely create a thinner
and<00:05:31.889> longer<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.970> goes<00:05:37.910> so<00:05:38.910> that's<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.419> wrap

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
and longer and goes so that's a wrap

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.260 
and longer and goes so that's a wrap
