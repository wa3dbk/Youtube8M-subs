players in this Lobby I think there was

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.270

only<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.189> random<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.000> um

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
only one was here random I don't know um

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
only one was here random I don't know um
it<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.490> incredibly<00:01:27.090> quickly<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it goes incredibly quickly I this is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
it goes incredibly quickly I this is
