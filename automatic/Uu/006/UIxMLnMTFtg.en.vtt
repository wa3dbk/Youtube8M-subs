00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
like this a lot of people like to do

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119

they're barely gripping it right here
but<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.219> sure<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> use<00:01:03.750> a

hook grip because this forces you to
