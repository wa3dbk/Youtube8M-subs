00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 Hello everyone today I was thinking 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.259
 do a video review for some of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.349
 board games 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.750
 but when I opened the closet I started to choose not 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.350
 I could decide which of them 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.029
 make a review so i will show you that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 we are at home 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 if you want to see us review 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 some of these games in the comments under 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.949
