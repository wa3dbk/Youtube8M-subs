 we are a little cold but do not think 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.710
 nothing more is no longer winter in Moscow 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 spring is in full swing 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.600
 but it's snowing but running is such a discipline 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 which can be practiced in any weather 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.360

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.420
 and we are preparing sneakers feet in winter and spring 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.280
 but with not nevertheless eat say no 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.959
 bad weather have bad clothes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.930
 today we will just talk how 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.040
 properly dressed on from the competition and on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.220
 training run 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
 clothes should be free and she is not 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.519
 should hold down the movement because 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.950
 any constraint of movement is superfluous 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.720
 waste of energy and special attention 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.829
 please take your choice of sneakers 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.320
 because sneakers 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.510
 this is what all the other parts suffer from 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.180
 body ankle knees sneakers must 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.370
 be special for running with soft 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.440
 enough heel to run 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 on asphalt and fit you in size 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.850
 remember that running shoes we 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.340
 choose one size larger than your 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.850
 size so that there is no discomfort for 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.040
 soldering 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.610
 hand must be bent while running 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 90 degrees 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.130
 hand can not raise the hand above the chest 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.560
 while running and do not lead the brush back further 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.019
 then hands should shift 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.519
 towards the center but do not cross 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.769
 the brush should line the nose 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.750
 so that there are no twisting movements and 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.690
 arms should not be too tight 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.060
 so when a man runs he must 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.790
 easy free with loose keys 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 work with your hands and thereby set 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.359
 the pace of the legs must be a longer god 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 and shorter exhalation that is on 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.100
 let's take three steps you breathe in and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.590
 two steps you exhale thus 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.250
 you will observe the correct rhythm 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.560
 breath 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.050

 We organize together with Natalia 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.849

 development camps where they can go 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.079
