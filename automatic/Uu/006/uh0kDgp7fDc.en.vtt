00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.350
 no 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 after 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.360
 we're not going to turn around the pot I 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.360
 board this rocket 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 you will stay here and protect the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.309
 cortex until the army is at 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.600
 full charge 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.399
 I'm sorry that ends like this 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.379
 I wish I had another solution 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.310
 but nobody else has the slightest 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.050
 chance facing the ancestors 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.910
 glad to see that you have chosen 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.530
 your camp doctor I'm going to open this 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 door 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 it's useless 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.580
 elio legasse flapi I hope you 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.860
 go well we meet today 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.299
 for the end of exodus are simply 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.250
 so this is a spoile video if you do not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 do not want to be spoiled well I you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 invite to see other tutorials that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 I did on this map just go 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 play on this card is therefore not to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.770
 watch the video 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.110
 so so frankly this map I 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.610
 found quite simple only except or at 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 moments it's really the brothel my 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 sheets 3 it's easy to survive I 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.830
 found quite simple where is what was 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.479
 well it was almost there but 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.970
 almost all types of yen except 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.190
 the plants vs. zombies as I them 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 domain call is so here's for 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.750
 these throw in companion accompanied 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.850
 of super league so here is no bezeq 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 and in his super ninja friends so 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
 here we have succeeded the map is really 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 very very simple I give you a few 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 little tips well here succeed it's 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.640
 that already the players and still 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.950
 special tears that can be good 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.819
 effective when it's the brothel or if 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.579
 we must not take it 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.750
 that they take mx1 grenades so 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.760
 when at least it's highway bagdad 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 well it's a pomegranate mx1 your feet that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 kill what's around 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.799
 so that's it then you're stuck in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.480
 the spawn once you have activated 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.489
 and six generators it seems to me that we have 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.370
 six must return to the spawn is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.780
 activated I believe it's not the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.519
 vortex if something like this where all 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.410
 players need to tap on it at wholesale 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.820
 then you have ancestors who go 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.350
 to arrive a gauge which must be filled 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.660
 then the allies can not destroy 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 this object that you activate because 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.630
 I 'm not at all the name it's this 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.370
 that you brought back to the end of the way 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.829
 big canning and so here are the allies 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.269
 does not show damage to this brothel is 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.859
 but you have ancestors who 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.870
 happened could have like camps 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.190
 u2 us in the end we got 1 kg at this 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.799
 post is the fourth did not even have 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.620
 need to kill him so that's it 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.989
 depends 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.060
 your time that you put to kill 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.690
 aliens that's how I think 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.799
 the vortex it seems to me little fill 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.349
 so then I give you some 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.580
 tips to easily kill years 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.870
 is just to put you the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.970
 really in melee and the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.170
 withdraw at the level of their heads here so 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.670
 you are putting to clinch in their 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.349
 head they can be really deadly that 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.209
 Damage to them pauli 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.180
 look crazy black hole and shield 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.349
 it can also be fatal to you 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.140
 we saw a black hole in a loop if you 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.930
 you move away you hide yourself next 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.970
 I recommend the vulture and not the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.170
 turret the return it destroys itself 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.260
 really easily given that a 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.640
 big big number of alien especially that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.109
 your towers can be improved since the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.430
 update or even if it's 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.140
 literally from larnack the points 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.280
 that they put for the vulture who 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.859
 last longer anyway 50 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.000
 points is expensive so here's what 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.500
 that was pretty much everything I'm going 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.849
 tell you with the amap so I will you 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.430
 leave with a bit of gameplay and with 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.620
 hungry drivers so that I have not 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.970
 too much honestly understand a great all 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.079
 case break out on this map do not hesitate 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.159
 not to subscribe if it is not already 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.879
 done i 'll tell you take care of 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.879
 you and next season 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.889
 history repeats itself a species 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.569
 disappears 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.569
 and our just takes his place 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:25.050
 so many sacred lives for the survival of 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:27.779
 a few privileged of power would 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.439
 the difference between survival of 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.439
 extensions 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.650
