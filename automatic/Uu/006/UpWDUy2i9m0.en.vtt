you'll<00:01:19.049> notice<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> spawn<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.979> its<00:01:20.130> kind

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you'll notice when you spawn is its kind

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
you'll notice when you spawn is its kind
of<00:01:20.430> dark<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.750> already

under<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> epic<00:01:23.490> overhang<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:24.990> gonna

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
under this epic overhang so we're gonna

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.630 
under this epic overhang so we're gonna
go<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> second<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.220> another<00:01:26.400> cool

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
playing survival and you have a little
difficult<00:01:33.960> time<00:01:34.110> finding<00:01:34.470> coal<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.829> anyways

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
difficult time finding coal but anyways

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
difficult time finding coal but anyways
we'll<00:01:35.700> fly<00:01:35.909> straight<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.079> see

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
we'll fly straight up and as you can see

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.780 
we'll fly straight up and as you can see
we<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.650> over<00:01:38.369> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
we are over this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
we are over this
overhang<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
overhang right over here you can see the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.789 
overhang right over here you can see the
lava<00:01:40.710> fall<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.649> like<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
lava fall right over there I like this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
lava fall right over there I like this
area<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.670> it'd<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.909> really

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

I'm gonna show you one thing that I

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.450 
I'm gonna show you one thing that I
think<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.330> cool<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:16.460> structure

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
think is really cool is this structure

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.460 
think is really cool is this structure
right<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> middle<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.720> looks<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
right in the middle it looks like a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.470 
right in the middle it looks like a
giant<00:02:19.830> scythe<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.700> don't<00:02:20.880> know<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.450> looks

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
giant scythe I don't know what it looks

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.910 
giant scythe I don't know what it looks
like<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.020> because<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
like to you because you know it's in the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.620 
like to you because you know it's in the
oddly<00:02:23.220> beholder<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.420> looks<00:02:24.450> like

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
oddly beholder but I think it looks like

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
oddly beholder but I think it looks like
a<00:02:24.690> scythe<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.410> looks<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:25.620> epic<00:02:25.980> so

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a scythe I think it looks really epic so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.280 
a scythe I think it looks really epic so
you<00:02:27.030> could<00:02:27.240> definitely<00:02:27.360> build<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.960> really

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you could definitely build like a really

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710 
you could definitely build like a really
cool<00:02:28.470> cave<00:02:28.710> home<00:02:28.920> inside<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.540> over<00:02:30.540> here

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
cool cave home inside that's over here

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
cool cave home inside that's over here
it's<00:02:30.840> got<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.990> nice<00:02:31.260> little<00:02:31.650> overhang<00:02:32.640> which

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it's got a nice little overhang which

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's got a nice little overhang which
would<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.450> perfect<00:02:33.870> responding<00:02:34.350> some<00:02:34.530> mobs<00:02:34.709> if

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
would be perfect responding some mobs if

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860 
would be perfect responding some mobs if
you<00:02:34.980> want<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> check<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.870> another

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you want to check that out another

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.630 
you want to check that out another
little<00:02:37.440> thing<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.860> noticed<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.459> looks

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
little thing that I noticed that looks

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.610 
little thing that I noticed that looks
pretty<00:02:39.060> cool<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.780> seed<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.200> over<00:02:40.440> here

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
pretty cool about the seed is over here

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.610 
pretty cool about the seed is over here
has<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.740> really<00:02:41.430> small<00:02:42.110> overhang<00:02:43.110> right<00:02:43.410> over

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
has a really small overhang right over

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.780 
has a really small overhang right over
here<00:02:43.770> as<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.100> there's<00:02:44.490> some<00:02:44.640> more

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
here as you can see there's some more

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
here as you can see there's some more
coal<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.540> kind<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> cool<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.080> could

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
coal in here it's kind of cool you could

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.740 
coal in here it's kind of cool you could
probably<00:02:46.590> build<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.459> nice<00:02:47.700> hidden<00:02:48.239> Hut<00:02:48.450> over

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
probably build a nice hidden Hut over

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.840 
probably build a nice hidden Hut over
here<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.650> might<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> Awesome

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
here so that might be kind of Awesome

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.460 
here so that might be kind of Awesome

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
flat grassy area near the water sleep
this<00:02:58.470> would<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.770> perfect<00:02:59.520> for<00:02:59.760> building<00:03:00.390> like

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
this would be perfect for building like

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.070 
this would be perfect for building like
a<00:03:00.540> dock<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.050> boating<00:03:01.410> area<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.810> another<00:03:03.810> thing

a dock or boating area and another thing
that<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.739> really<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.160> nice<00:03:05.459> about

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
the seat is it has a lot of a mix

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.790 
the seat is it has a lot of a mix
between<00:03:08.390> rough<00:03:09.390> terrain<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.989> also<00:03:10.260> flat<00:03:10.590> land

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
between rough terrain and also flat land
