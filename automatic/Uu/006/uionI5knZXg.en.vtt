00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.290 

I<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.900> we<00:00:16.990> left<00:00:17.050> out<00:00:17.440> one<00:00:17.650> of<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.860> most

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I think we left out one of the most

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.600 
I think we left out one of the most
controversial<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:20.190> interesting<00:00:21.190> elements

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
controversial and interesting elements

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.260 
controversial and interesting elements
that<00:00:22.860> is<00:00:23.860> overlooked<00:00:24.369> in<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.640> golf<00:00:24.820> swing<00:00:25.060> is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
that is overlooked in the golf swing is

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.710 
that is overlooked in the golf swing is
ball<00:00:25.840> position<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.279> I<00:00:27.430> think<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.820> it's<00:00:28.570> a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
ball position and I think that it's a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.290 
ball position and I think that it's a
mistake<00:00:29.080> that<00:00:29.110> I<00:00:29.320> see<00:00:29.640> such<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.670> large<00:00:31.180> number

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
mistake that I see such a large number

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.380 
mistake that I see such a large number
of<00:00:31.720> people<00:00:32.320> making<00:00:32.500> their<00:00:32.710> games<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:34.360> I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
of people making their games that I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.970 
of people making their games that I
wanted<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.840> deal<00:00:35.020> with<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:35.559> give<00:00:35.860> you

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
wanted to deal with this and give you

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.070 
wanted to deal with this and give you
some<00:00:36.220> indication<00:00:36.820> as<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.390> difference

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
some indication as to the difference

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.470 
some indication as to the difference
between<00:00:38.290> an<00:00:38.650> iron<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.160> wood<00:00:39.670> ball<00:00:39.940> position

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
between an iron and a wood ball position

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.010 
between an iron and a wood ball position
and<00:00:41.760> give<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.940> routine<00:00:43.330> that<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.660> can<00:00:43.690> work

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
and give you a routine that you can work

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.110 
and give you a routine that you can work
on<00:00:44.260> both<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:44.980> practice<00:00:45.160> but<00:00:45.520> take<00:00:45.730> out<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
on both in practice but take out to the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.090 
on both in practice but take out to the
golf<00:00:46.360> course<00:00:46.629> so<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:46.840> you<00:00:47.080> can<00:00:47.290> guarantee

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
golf course so that you can guarantee

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.579 
golf course so that you can guarantee
the<00:00:48.280> correct<00:00:48.610> ball<00:00:48.790> position<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.589> after

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
the correct ball position because after

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.219 
the correct ball position because after
all<00:00:50.650> if<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:50.979> make<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.159> perfect<00:00:51.489> swing<00:00:52.059> and<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
all if you make a perfect swing and the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.689 
all if you make a perfect swing and the
ball<00:00:53.409> isn't<00:00:53.589> in<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.890> correct<00:00:54.190> position<00:00:54.610> in

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
ball isn't in the correct position in

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.850 
ball isn't in the correct position in
your<00:00:54.850> stance<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:56.350> not<00:00:56.470> going<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.680> hit<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
your stance you're not going to hit the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.530 
your stance you're not going to hit the
ball<00:00:57.070> solidly<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:58.000> you're<00:00:58.180> certainly<00:00:58.449> not

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
ball solidly and you're certainly not

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.000 
ball solidly and you're certainly not
going<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.809> hit<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:58.960> ball<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.320> target<00:00:59.830> so<00:00:59.949> it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
going to hit the ball on target so it's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.079 
going to hit the ball on target so it's
a<00:01:00.159> very<00:01:00.460> big<00:01:00.790> element<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.540> playing<00:01:02.170> well<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.820> I

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
a very big element of playing well now I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.430 
a very big element of playing well now I
think<00:01:04.479> most<00:01:04.780> people<00:01:04.960> would<00:01:05.290> probably

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
think most people would probably

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.860 
think most people would probably
understand<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.190> as<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:07.060> club<00:01:07.210> gets<00:01:07.479> shorter

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
understand that as the club gets shorter

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.440 
understand that as the club gets shorter
you<00:01:07.960> move<00:01:08.140> from<00:01:08.320> woods<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.370> irons<00:01:09.729> into<00:01:10.000> wedges

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
you move from woods to irons into wedges

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.600 
you move from woods to irons into wedges
the<00:01:11.290> ball<00:01:11.470> position<00:01:11.740> should<00:01:12.130> move<00:01:12.370> back<00:01:12.400> in

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
the ball position should move back in

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.480 
the ball position should move back in
the<00:01:12.790> stance<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:14.409> over<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.040> years<00:01:15.070> playing

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the stance but over the years playing

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.030 
the stance but over the years playing
with<00:01:15.580> people<00:01:15.940> in<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.270> params<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.040> Club

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
with people in in params and Club

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.010 
with people in in params and Club
members<00:01:18.430> it's<00:01:18.670> something<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.210> see<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.570> huge

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
members it's something that I see a huge

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.980 
members it's something that I see a huge
amount<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.320> confusion<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:22.210> players<00:01:22.600> moving

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
amount of confusion with players moving

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.080 
amount of confusion with players moving
the<00:01:23.230> ball<00:01:23.380> back<00:01:23.620> almost<00:01:23.860> if<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.820> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
the ball back almost if you like a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.530 
the ball back almost if you like a
full-width<00:01:26.050> in<00:01:26.350> their<00:01:27.130> stance<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.760> huge<00:01:28.390> number

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
full-width in their stance a huge number

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.940 
full-width in their stance a huge number
of<00:01:28.720> people<00:01:28.930> believing<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.710> should<00:01:29.860> hit

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
of people believing that you should hit

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.260 
of people believing that you should hit
the<00:01:30.070> ball<00:01:30.220> from<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> center<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.000> stance

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the ball from the center of the stance

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.920 
the ball from the center of the stance
and<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:32.410> think<00:01:32.710> these<00:01:33.370> issues<00:01:33.610> cause<00:01:34.150> big

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
and I think these issues cause big

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.570 
and I think these issues cause big
faults<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:36.100> golf<00:01:36.280> swing

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.700

short<00:02:05.110> game<00:02:05.350> shots<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:06.340> true<00:02:06.730> that<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.090> ball

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
short game shots it's true that the ball

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.910 
short game shots it's true that the ball
position<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.870> short<00:02:08.140> game<00:02:08.319> shot<00:02:08.619> would<00:02:08.769> be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
position in a short game shot would be

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.830 
position in a short game shot would be
different<00:02:09.670> from<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.179> full<00:02:10.390> swing<00:02:10.629> and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
different from that of a full swing and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.430 
different from that of a full swing and
I've<00:02:10.959> dealt<00:02:11.200> with<00:02:11.379> that<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.709> previous<00:02:12.060> videos

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I've dealt with that in previous videos

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.750 
I've dealt with that in previous videos
what<00:02:14.440> I'm<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:14.830> today<00:02:15.010> simplify

do is I'm going to make an address and
the<00:02:38.030> first<00:02:38.269> thing<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:38.599> need<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.780> understand

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
the first thing we need to understand

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.990 
the first thing we need to understand
with<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> driver<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.610> we're<00:02:40.760> attempting

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
with the driver is that we're attempting

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.570 
with the driver is that we're attempting
to<00:02:41.269> hit<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.629> ball<00:02:41.810> slightly<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.800> upswing

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
to hit the ball slightly on the upswing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.119 
to hit the ball slightly on the upswing
so<00:02:44.300> if<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.480> were<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.720> use<00:02:44.900> launch<00:02:45.650> monitor

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
so if you were to use launch monitor

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.070 
so if you were to use launch monitor
data<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.849> you've<00:02:47.030> been<00:02:47.180> for<00:02:47.360> driver<00:02:47.599> fittings

data if you've been for driver fittings

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.960 
data if you've been for driver fittings
in<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> past<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.160> may<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.370> aware<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
in the past you may be aware that a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.180 
in the past you may be aware that a
driver<00:02:50.390> you're<00:02:50.930> looking<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.379> hit<00:02:51.530> potentially

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
driver you're looking to hit potentially

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.199 
driver you're looking to hit potentially
two<00:02:52.760> three<00:02:53.060> four<00:02:53.390> degrees<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> upswing

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
two three four degrees on the upswing

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.820 
two three four degrees on the upswing
after<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.330> bottom<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.260> swing<00:02:57.500> arc

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
after the bottom of the swing arc

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.740 
after the bottom of the swing arc
so<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.370> help<00:02:58.700> hit<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.030> ball<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.450> upswing

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
so to help hit the ball on the upswing

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.559 
so to help hit the ball on the upswing
we<00:03:00.590> need<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.890> position<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.430> ball<00:03:01.549> for<00:03:02.329> what's

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
we need to position the ball for what's

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.780 
we need to position the ball for what's
the<00:03:02.720> target<00:03:03.230> side<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.680> your<00:03:04.010> stance<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.549> the

distance<00:03:41.630> from<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.930> stance<00:03:42.170> on<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.470> notice

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
distance from the stance on you notice

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.220 
distance from the stance on you notice
that<00:03:43.310> my<00:03:43.459> feet<00:03:43.670> are<00:03:43.819> together<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.569> this<00:03:44.959> line

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
that my feet are together and this line

that my feet are together and this line
of<00:03:45.380> balls<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.769> down<00:03:46.069> already<00:03:46.790> opposite<00:03:47.269> my

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
of balls is down already opposite my

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.410 
of balls is down already opposite my
left<00:03:47.599> heel<00:03:48.519> now<00:03:49.519> all<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.239> when<00:03:50.389> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
left heel now all I have to do when I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.120 
left heel now all I have to do when I
build<00:03:50.720> my<00:03:50.780> stance<00:03:51.139> is<00:03:51.380> oh<00:03:51.440> for<00:03:51.650> sure<00:03:51.799> my<00:03:51.950> heel

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
build my stance is oh for sure my heel

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.129 
build my stance is oh for sure my heel
to<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.459> line<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.849> that<00:03:52.970> ball<00:03:53.150> position<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
to that line to that ball position to

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.979 
to that line to that ball position to
set<00:03:54.380> my<00:03:54.530> stance<00:03:54.829> width<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.340> simply<00:03:56.060> move<00:03:56.780> my

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
set my stance width I simply move my

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.800 
set my stance width I simply move my
right<00:03:57.260> foot<00:03:57.560> only<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:59.150> guarantees<00:03:59.780> that

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
right foot only and that guarantees that

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.509 
right foot only and that guarantees that
the<00:04:00.109> ball<00:04:00.260> position<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.799> down<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.130> left<00:04:01.340> side

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
the ball position is down the left side

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.030 
the ball position is down the left side
of<00:04:01.639> my<00:04:01.760> stance<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.380> can<00:04:03.380> then<00:04:03.500> build<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.859> rest

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
of my stance I can then build the rest

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.159 
of my stance I can then build the rest
of<00:04:04.190> my<00:04:04.280> set<00:04:04.489> up<00:04:04.700> drive<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.239> shaft<00:04:05.540> in<00:04:05.690> position

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
of my set up drive a shaft in position

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.220 
of my set up drive a shaft in position
set<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.130> posture<00:04:07.660> now<00:04:08.660> I'm<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.019> position

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
set the posture now I'm in a position

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.530 
set the posture now I'm in a position
slightly<00:04:09.709> behind<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.430> line<00:04:10.639> of<00:04:10.790> balls<00:04:11.000> was

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
slightly behind that line of balls was

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.870 
slightly behind that line of balls was
very<00:04:11.780> easy<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.410> me<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.530> now<00:04:12.829> rotate<00:04:13.609> through

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
very easy for me to now rotate through

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.729 
very easy for me to now rotate through
and<00:04:14.299> strike<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.079> ball<00:04:15.200> slightly<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.709> the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
and strike the ball slightly on the

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.000 
and strike the ball slightly on the
upswing<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.870> drive<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.229> ball<00:04:18.530> position<00:04:18.950> I

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
upswing so to drive a ball position I

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.289 
upswing so to drive a ball position I
think<00:04:19.070> that's<00:04:19.340> probably<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.940> one<00:04:20.060> that

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
think that's probably the one that

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.600 
think that's probably the one that
majority<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:21.169> players<00:04:21.500> are<00:04:21.799> most<00:04:22.070> aware<00:04:22.400> of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
majority of players are most aware of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.370 
majority of players are most aware of
the<00:04:22.729> ball<00:04:22.940> forwards<00:04:23.389> in<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.539> stance<00:04:23.870> but<00:04:24.229> the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
the ball forwards in the stance but the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.839 
the ball forwards in the stance but the
reason<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:24.860> forwards<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:25.520> that<00:04:25.639> we<00:04:25.700> can

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
reason it's forwards is so that we can

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.940 
reason it's forwards is so that we can
strike<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.300> slightly<00:04:26.599> on<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.020> upswing<00:04:27.289> and

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
strike it slightly on the upswing and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.159 
strike it slightly on the upswing and
keep<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.310> body<00:04:28.490> in<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.789> head<00:04:28.940> position

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
keep the body in the head position

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.629 
keep the body in the head position
slightly<00:04:30.169> behind<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.830> ball<00:04:31.070> as<00:04:31.220> we're<00:04:31.400> doing

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
slightly behind the ball as we're doing

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.159 
slightly behind the ball as we're doing
so<00:04:31.849> now<00:04:32.780> with<00:04:33.410> an<00:04:33.530> iron<00:04:33.800> as<00:04:33.889> we've<00:04:34.070> indicated

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
so now with an iron as we've indicated

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.570 
so now with an iron as we've indicated
things<00:04:36.169> change<00:04:36.469> slightly

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
things change slightly

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.880 
things change slightly
because<00:04:38.240> with<00:04:38.390> an<00:04:38.480> iron<00:04:38.810> we're<00:04:39.470> looking<00:04:39.740> to

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
because with an iron we're looking to

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.910 
because with an iron we're looking to
hit<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.130> ball<00:04:40.340> on<00:04:40.490> now<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.330> downswing<00:04:41.920> not

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
hit the ball on now on the downswing not

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.900 
hit the ball on now on the downswing not
on<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.190> upswing<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:46.400> ball<00:04:46.610> position

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
on the upswing so the ball position

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.570 
on the upswing so the ball position
potentially<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.660> going<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:48.020> different

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
potentially is going to be different

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.750 
potentially is going to be different
from<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:51.170> driver<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:51.890> don't<00:04:52.460> want<00:04:52.610> to

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
from that of the driver we don't want to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.790 
from that of the driver we don't want to
hit<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.030> ball<00:04:53.180> on<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:54.110> upswing<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.680> would

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
hit the ball on the upswing that would

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.420 
hit the ball on the upswing that would
cause<00:04:55.010> thin<00:04:55.730> shots<00:04:56.060> top<00:04:56.390> shots<00:04:56.750> certainly<00:04:57.430> it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
cause thin shots top shots certainly it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.010 
cause thin shots top shots certainly it
also<00:04:58.580> encourage<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.180> club<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.780> hit<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
also encourage the club to hit the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.950 
also encourage the club to hit the
ground<00:05:00.260> first<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:01.270> we're<00:05:02.270> looking<00:05:02.630> out<00:05:02.780> for<00:05:02.870> a

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
ground first so we're looking out for a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.180 
ground first so we're looking out for a
ball<00:05:03.110> position<00:05:03.500> which<00:05:03.620> is<00:05:03.800> moved<00:05:04.010> back

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
ball position which is moved back

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.850 
ball position which is moved back
slightly<00:05:04.600> this<00:05:05.600> is<00:05:05.840> probably<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.350> big<00:05:06.560> thing

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
slightly this is probably the big thing

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.830 
slightly this is probably the big thing
that<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:07.070> see<00:05:07.340> mistakes<00:05:07.700> being<00:05:08.420> made<00:05:08.510> with

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
that I see mistakes being made with

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.510 
that I see mistakes being made with
because<00:05:09.170> there's<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.440> tendency<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:10.130> move<00:05:10.310> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
because there's a tendency to move the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.960 
because there's a tendency to move the
ball<00:05:10.670> too<00:05:11.000> far<00:05:11.270> back<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.840> stance<00:05:12.220> so<00:05:13.220> how

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
ball too far back in the stance so how

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.400 
ball too far back in the stance so how
far<00:05:14.270> back<00:05:14.330> should<00:05:14.540> we<00:05:14.900> go<00:05:15.050> well<00:05:15.880> from<00:05:16.880> driver

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
far back should we go well from driver

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.680 
far back should we go well from driver
to<00:05:18.410> long<00:05:18.950> medium<00:05:19.430> even<00:05:20.090> into<00:05:20.300> your<00:05:20.420> short

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
to long medium even into your short

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.090 
to long medium even into your short
irons<00:05:21.020> I'm<00:05:21.110> going<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.320> give<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.500> one<00:05:21.710> fixed

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
irons I'm going to give you one fixed

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.830 
irons I'm going to give you one fixed
ball<00:05:22.310> position<00:05:22.820> which<00:05:23.300> will<00:05:23.480> guarantee

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
ball position which will guarantee

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.080 
ball position which will guarantee
success<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.860> make<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.400> lot<00:05:25.640> easier<00:05:25.670> to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
success and make it a lot easier to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.150 
success and make it a lot easier to
create<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:26.570> correct<00:05:26.780> impact<00:05:27.260> position<00:05:27.410> and

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
create the correct impact position and

something that you can work on with
every<00:05:48.470> shot<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.220> when<00:05:49.640> we<00:05:49.760> address<00:05:50.030> an<00:05:50.180> iron

an<00:06:20.180> inch<00:06:20.330> inch-and-a-half<00:06:20.870> narrower<00:06:21.440> than

that of the driver which is a much wider
swing<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.620> therefore<00:06:25.010> needs<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.310> little<00:06:25.550> bit

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
swing and therefore needs a little bit

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.000 
swing and therefore needs a little bit
more<00:06:25.820> stability<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.450> support<00:06:26.600> so<00:06:27.380> for<00:06:27.920> an

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
more stability and support so for an

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.400 
more stability and support so for an
iron<00:06:28.220> shot<00:06:28.490> with<00:06:28.940> that<00:06:29.090> ball<00:06:29.330> position<00:06:29.870> the

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
inside of your heels underneath your hip

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.950 
inside of your heels underneath your hip
sockets<00:06:34.310> is<00:06:34.790> wide<00:06:35.150> enough<00:06:35.420> to<00:06:35.480> give<00:06:35.720> stability

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
sockets is wide enough to give stability

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960 
sockets is wide enough to give stability
and<00:06:37.210> allows<00:06:38.210> you<00:06:38.600> to<00:06:38.870> move<00:06:39.670> forwards<00:06:40.670> into

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
and allows you to move forwards into

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.700 
and allows you to move forwards into
your<00:06:41.120> lead<00:06:41.360> side<00:06:41.720> as<00:06:41.930> you're<00:06:42.110> striking<00:06:42.380> the

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
your lead side as you're striking the

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.670 
your lead side as you're striking the
ball<00:06:42.860> guaranteeing<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.700> downward<00:06:44.150> strike<00:06:44.680> the

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
ball guaranteeing a downward strike the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.470 
ball guaranteeing a downward strike the
head<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.010> the<00:06:46.100> chest<00:06:46.310> more<00:06:46.670> over<00:06:46.970> the<00:06:47.090> top<00:06:47.120> of

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
head and the chest more over the top of

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.620 
head and the chest more over the top of
the<00:06:47.600> ball<00:06:48.250> so<00:06:49.250> you're<00:06:49.340> now<00:06:49.520> striking<00:06:49.880> ball<00:06:50.300> and

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
the ball so you're now striking ball and

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.890 
the ball so you're now striking ball and
then

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
then

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.070 
then
divert<00:06:51.169> afterwards<00:06:52.210> so<00:06:53.210> two<00:06:53.419> ball<00:06:53.630> positions

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
divert afterwards so two ball positions

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.950 
divert afterwards so two ball positions
which<00:06:54.259> are<00:06:54.410> critical<00:06:55.100> to<00:06:55.970> consistent<00:06:56.570> impact

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
which are critical to consistent impact

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.570 
which are critical to consistent impact
positions<00:06:57.380> and<00:06:57.560> consistent<00:06:58.070> ball<00:06:58.220> striking

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
positions and consistent ball striking

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.939 
positions and consistent ball striking
if<00:06:59.270> you<00:06:59.539> put<00:06:59.810> the<00:06:59.930> ball<00:07:00.110> in<00:07:00.320> the<00:07:00.410> center<00:07:00.590> of<00:07:00.860> the

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
thin or fat shots

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.000 
thin or fat shots
so<00:07:23.360> if<00:07:23.780> you're<00:07:23.990> somebody<00:07:24.199> who<00:07:24.380> takes<00:07:24.590> a<00:07:24.740> divot

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
so if you're somebody who takes a divot

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.430 
so if you're somebody who takes a divot
behind<00:07:25.370> the<00:07:25.490> ball<00:07:25.900> don't<00:07:26.900> move<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:27.229> ball<00:07:27.410> back

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
behind the ball don't move the ball back

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.920 
behind the ball don't move the ball back
to<00:07:27.740> the<00:07:27.770> divot<00:07:28.210> try<00:07:29.210> and<00:07:29.330> move<00:07:29.419> the<00:07:29.600> divot

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930 
to the divot try and move the divot

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.650 
to the divot try and move the divot
forwards<00:07:30.410> to<00:07:30.590> the<00:07:30.680> ball<00:07:30.860> so<00:07:31.400> one<00:07:32.210> club<00:07:32.449> head

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 
forwards to the ball so one club head

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.260 
forwards to the ball so one club head
width<00:07:32.870> inside<00:07:33.470> the<00:07:33.620> left<00:07:33.800> heel<00:07:34.010> for<00:07:34.880> your<00:07:34.970> ions

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
width inside the left heel for your ions

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.590 
width inside the left heel for your ions

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
an inch wider with the stamps and bang

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.629 
an inch wider with the stamps and bang
