playing game on this this might not be
every<00:03:26.220> graphics<00:03:26.700> game<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.180> let's<00:03:27.510> switch<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
every graphics game so let's switch it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.470 
every graphics game so let's switch it
over<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.260> something<00:03:28.889> more<00:03:29.670> decent<00:03:30.180> something

a<00:03:30.569> little<00:03:30.690> bit<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.019> suitable<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.709> sort

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
a little bit more suitable for the sort

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.039 
a little bit more suitable for the sort
of<00:03:31.950> processor<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.030> make<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> work<00:03:33.540> harder

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
of processor just to make it work harder

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.539 
of processor just to make it work harder
and<00:03:34.230> have<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> look<00:03:34.799> at<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.920> graphics<00:03:35.190> display
