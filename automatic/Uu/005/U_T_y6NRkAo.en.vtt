00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.210 
robot arm and they're doing different
grasping<00:02:29.970> tasks<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:31.020> how<00:02:31.740> accurately

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
grasping tasks to see how accurately

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.520 
grasping tasks to see how accurately
memek<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.300> cool<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.660> you're<00:02:34.020> speaking

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
memek you so cool that you're speaking

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
memek you so cool that you're speaking
some<00:02:34.800> will<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.010> headed<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> Datagram

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
some will be headed this is a Datagram

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.590 
some will be headed this is a Datagram
so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
so

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.590 
so
all<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.050> these<00:02:41.200> strips<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.070> back<00:02:42.600> bend

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
all of these strips is in the back bend

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.750 
all of these strips is in the back bend
sensors<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.560> basically<00:02:45.040> as<00:02:45.190> I've<00:02:45.400> been<00:02:45.550> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
sensors so basically as I've been that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.270 
sensors so basically as I've been that
it<00:02:46.510> sends<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.990> signal<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.380> give<00:02:47.710> you<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.040> much

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it sends a signal to give you so much

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.250 
it sends a signal to give you so much
they<00:02:48.490> relate<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.090> back<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:49.600> was<00:02:49.750> what<00:02:50.140> do

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
they relate it back in what was what do

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.720 
they relate it back in what was what do
you<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.740> there<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:51.190> ever<00:02:51.370> since<00:02:51.580> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
you have in there you ever since the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.760 
you have in there you ever since the
stuff<00:02:51.970> about<00:02:52.240> yoga<00:02:52.660> where<00:02:52.960> it's<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.410> worth<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
stuff about yoga where it's not worth it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.890 
stuff about yoga where it's not worth it
