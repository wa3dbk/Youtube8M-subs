00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there and show them that look I put in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
there and show them that look I put in
all<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.070> hard<00:01:35.310> work<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.939> amount<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

hard work that any of you guys have now

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
hard work that any of you guys have now
I<00:01:38.250> might<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> same<00:01:39.420> exact<00:01:39.750> body

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
I might not have the same exact body

body that you've been able to build now

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
body that you've been able to build now
it's<00:01:50.549> not<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.090> I've<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> any<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.110> work

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

be<00:01:59.549> doing<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> transformational

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
be doing like a transformational

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
be doing like a transformational
division<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> guys<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.189> know

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
division now if you guys don't know

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690 
division now if you guys don't know
there<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:03.149> division<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.430> leagues<00:02:05.430> or

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there is a division in some leagues or

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.249 
there is a division in some leagues or
whatever<00:02:05.939> they're<00:02:06.119> called<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.719> whatever

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
whatever they're called to be whatever

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.089 
whatever they're called to be whatever
they're<00:02:07.530> called

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
they're called

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.949 
they're called
there's<00:02:08.819> there<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.209> transformational

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
there's there is a transformational

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.530 
there's there is a transformational
division<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.469> some<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.829> them<00:02:11.209> which<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.389> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
division that some of them which is like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.789 
division that some of them which is like
for<00:02:12.810> people<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.319> lost<00:02:13.499> a<00:02:13.680> lot<00:02:13.769> of

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
for people that have lost a lot of

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.319 
for people that have lost a lot of
weight<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.189> maybe<00:02:14.400> even<00:02:14.489> gained<00:02:14.909> weight<00:02:15.090> too

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
weight or maybe even gained weight too

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.550 
weight or maybe even gained weight too
but<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.689> that<00:02:15.900> there's<00:02:16.019> one<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.379> people

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
but I know that there's one for people

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.780 
but I know that there's one for people
that<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.769> lost<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.189> weight<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that have lost a lot of weight now the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.920 
that have lost a lot of weight now the
show<00:02:17.969> that<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.359> to<00:02:18.389> be<00:02:18.480> doing<00:02:18.629> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
show that I'm going to be doing it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.209 
show that I'm going to be doing it
doesn't<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.409> one<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> those<00:02:19.709> those

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
doesn't have one of those those

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.709 
doesn't have one of those those
divisions<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.329> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.599> doing

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
divisions so I'm just going to be doing

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.949 
divisions so I'm just going to be doing
this<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.439> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.040> regular<00:02:23.849> people<00:02:24.269> now<00:02:24.480> I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
skin looks like you know I'm gonna go on

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
skin looks like you know I'm gonna go on
stage<00:02:31.889> and<00:02:32.129> I'm<00:02:32.430> gonna<00:02:32.549> bring<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.879> best

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
package that I can I'm gonna bulk up as

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.250 
package that I can I'm gonna bulk up as
hard<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.569> most<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.019> lift
