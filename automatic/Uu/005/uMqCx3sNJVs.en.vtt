00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.730
 on 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.020
 hello I would have done again like now 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.530
 the blog had and how you got your five 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.930
 minutes 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.580
 and again a question from you I became 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.509
 asked how is that if you have one 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.349
 guitar has and from when times a new one 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:29.880
 So drilling is the easiest 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.420
 The reason for a new customer is, of course, if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.430
 the reasons and the guitar really 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 are played down so that it already 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.790
 sometimes problems with those with the sounds 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.440
 there is that happening like this 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.920
 Let's assume you play in one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.200
 It's very common that maybe 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 quite normal because you get used to it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 has certain scales or 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.970
 you were always the same in the world 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.950
 tones and so on and so forth 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.410
 plays then you probably play 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.530
 some share more than others 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
 and depending on how thick the pages are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 which one can use the wear already 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.700
 be pretty blatant or 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 where the high sides are the higher ones 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.090
 the g string now especially the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.039
 stick and does not wrap around the creates 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.140
 like to hang around the bunch of chopsticks 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.469
 the thick strings are wrapped 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 there are times like pulling in the boat 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.249
 Chopsticks and that's exactly where 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.380
 the problems with the installation 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.179
 or tonal development 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.100
 you can create that so you like it 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.100
 a lot of played frets are welcome 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.499
 start to snow or just stop if 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.359
 which bind the ones in the positions where 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.770
 They where they played a lot there 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.420
 That can be quite that then 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.350
 just always the next higher bund 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.179
 starts to snap 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.459
 because the one before that played her down 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.170
 and then it may be that the 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.479
 Side position just does not skin anymore 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.069
 of course that is the most blatant 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.319
 In that case you have to have a guitar very much 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.109
 play a lot and if there is a new feature 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.490
 due and then how expensive it will be 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.139
 actually depends on what you for 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 if you have a digital one here 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.220
 that would be the case you have to new federation 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.120
 and the guitar has a so-called 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.460
 binding or binding binding and that is 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.530
 a plastic skirt around the neck 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.790
 around and when a guitar has something like that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.209
 then of course that has to be done 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.230
 become 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.090
 This is usually broken when the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.290
 banja remove and then this must be 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.450
 binding also new again and then 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.100
 I think it is so much and at 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.780
 i hope i say wrong now i am 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.630
 no guitar maker now i have one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.510
 at a guitar maker at digitask the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 the guitar maker is the one for the doctors 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 be the guitar building or for farin 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.920
 holiday properly and that has too 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.450
 own models would have to look it here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.670
 have kitas also comes is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.590
 written cy a in the own synonymous 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.690
 Generally own models are developed and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.540
 He told me a new version of mine 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.580
 guitar would cost about 250 euros 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 usually one plus minus 50 euros upwards 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.450
 or down maybe so on 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.820
 every case so about the rotation that would be one 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.550
 Complete new polishing with him 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.930
 binding with the metalworker i 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.090
 can finally speak for everyone 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.330
 then the next question is yes 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.049
 then, inevitably, you always have to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.890
 you do not have to renew all the reasons 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.440
 you can also dress a guitar 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.079
 is the so-called regrind of 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.180
 individual frets and you have to if 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.829
 you have to raise new frets you have to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.730
 anyway, because of the fretboard 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.320
 the script is not 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.060
 one hundred percent straight it can 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.230
 Do not be and then you have to go if you are 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.790
 the frets enter the are natural 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.019
 equal to the bunch has come in there 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.660
 Of course he has none 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.100
 But manufacturing tolerances are so much more 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.290
 that adds up then so far 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.620
 that a new digital on it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.739
 must be trained and at a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.720
 it can be used guitar 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.060
 you have such a guitar she is in 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.470
 you're traveling around that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.150
 I like to have happened 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.390
 lately only the case with a student 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.700
 from me and then happens girlfriend 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.220
 when the guitar is on somewhere against 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.140
 comes or at worst 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.350
 The bottom falls then there is sometime 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.930
 this touch of the pages gossip the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.360
 chatter against sbr and chopsticks and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.340
 just then you have a deep fat 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.080
 fat score somehow in the bunch is then 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.989
 it's just that there it can be that time 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.540
 that's the side in the bunch where that 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.550
 Happens is totally clever and she is not 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.770
 more sounds so that a lot to do 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.460
 but get along that way now it would be silly 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.440
 every 22 to 24 frets to renew 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.630
 just because one is broken so now 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.640
 theoretically theoretically 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.670
 You could certainly be a wish 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.540
 swap chopsticks that is guaranteed 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.980
 also feasible 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.450
 that would be a guitar maker if it were 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.730
 So it is necessary if the cores too 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.940
 Doll is certainly also doing others 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.710
 away, that would be a plot in after too 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.270
 celebrate and then just stop the rest 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.120
 then to finish the work goes on 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.980
 also like to be so one or 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.840
 if a guitar when the frets are high 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.240
 are enough if just enough 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.520
 meat is there you could also at one 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.770
 much played guitar before a new one 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.570
 Government may be due 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.830
 Also just realign the guitar 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.150
 I will also be the case 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.800
 cheaper than a new building and her that 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.320
 but you have to see in a case 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.300
 when which treatment really? 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.860
 makes sense so I hope I could 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.900
 So far, bring light into the dark 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.240
 as I said if you are for something 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.490
 interested in priming and something like that 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.169
 I would always, I would too 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.310
 not in the music business 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.650
 So then I would always for 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.900
 guitar makers go because depending on their value 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.210
 The instrument needs someone to do that 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.180
 that has the effect of the experience in it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.210
 So I wanted to say so 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.770
 times the guitarmaker the inexperienced 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.070
 could not have done so much yet 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.140
 certainly damage fingerboard and if 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.000
 Digitized are very valuable 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.010
 then of course that is difficult then 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.350
 At least one person can only see that 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.450
 really make the experience 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.070
 where you really have confidence in and 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.660
 one step further if you go 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.700
 vintage about instruments so if i have 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.710
 a stratocaster farmer 63 got the 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.060
 Is worth 15,000 euros then the 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.910
 does not guarantee somehow somewhere 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.020
 music shop in she's broke me 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.320
 So someone has to substantiate that 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.320
 do
