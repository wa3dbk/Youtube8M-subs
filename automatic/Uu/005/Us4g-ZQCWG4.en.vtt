00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.039
 good friends today I'm going to talk about plans 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.689
 this show he serves to be has animations 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.329
 the format that double vp 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.769
 we will not see the adobe flash program first 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.310
 that professional stress 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 - click 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.789
 good wake at the interface 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.570
 of the good exodus 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 we can already see that we have a scene and it does not tell us here 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.710
 the part where the layers go the layers 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 percent and masters that are 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860
 parts pose which suck invasion 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 by blind note here we have a barrier while 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 and we can also 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.760
 we can 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.730
 percent 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.550
 see that we have the size of our commented 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.870
 in the settings of the publication 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.560
 and well do not stay here we have our 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 tabs 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 from ram winds 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 What I want to show you is how flash works 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.330
 for example peek was a pleasure 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.130
 a movie with an animation 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 well here this layer we put character 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.350
 what are we going to do an animation sequence 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.530
 this part are left here they are called forensic love 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.650
 percent 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.719
 frames 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.200
 hugo movies 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 every 30 presented movement 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.630
 from a movie 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 if what you want to do m for example 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.730
 characters 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.990
 I'm not going to do with the tool by use so they can see how it's done 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.660
 first he drew it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 and here I have come 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.489
 let's extend the legs 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.429
 and we are going to activate this option that is more they put squinkies ti 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:17.849
 of onion 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.709
 we push 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.109
 and we copy 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.689
 percent and we give it 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.599
 create a turnip rein 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.739
 very close blanc ford if frei insert blanck and frei 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.689
 musk lic 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.619
 and we can see that this is why we see here that canvases qin 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:39.879
 here welfare in this part the frame does not exist anything is just not 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.549
 being the reference 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.959
 so we can move the valley natra min 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.239
 animation is cooked if it works standing 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.069
 I will not be a little more here 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.499
 for David 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.499
 perspective that is moving 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.259
 good insert 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.619
 m-clan 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.949
 if they were 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 corrupt hool emol - lions quinn 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.389
 so that it does not go correctly 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.679
 the other time 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 here it seems that our centrals have legs 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.139
 and is that in the future it is expected that for this process in front 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.289
 of the set yes the anp figures in 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.619
 Nestor animation 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.159
 it looks like he's walking 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.449
 in fact he is walking 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 we continue to complete the animation 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 I think I've gone a bit out of the sequence but 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.799
 percent the joke of this is to show them 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.179
 as it is a sequence animation 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:17.769
 they can do it with interfaces 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.299
 per hundred buttons 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.229
 l 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.680
 Really 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 It is a great tool 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.410
 There are other tools but it is the truth that for the benefits 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.830
 he takes it 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.499
 by street all 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.929
 we are going to play nastran animation to see how it is going 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.590
 we click 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
 if you can see now our invasion fiennes 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.279
 its movement 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.960
 if we wanted, add one more character 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.020
 only 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.460
 we would give 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.729
 i who says 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.949
 incer 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.949
 we put for example a sun 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 we want 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.069
 we want is to create our sun 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.349
 let's insert our sun here 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.529
 we are born with a tool 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.159
 I do not want yellow 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.490
 here I have my sun 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.339
 good what I want is that my sun 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.529
 think smile 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.529
 when being answered by playing the animation 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.089
 well let's create a layer 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.039
 of smile 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.039
 smile 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.879
 and with lauros you 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.509
 we make 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.439
 this series the sun 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:10.830
 yes we are very well 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.830
 if they were 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.369
 He tells me if he wants to laugh 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.369
 another plan if they were 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:32.360
 we want 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.279
 more polo prolonged the smile 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.930
 the eyes and we make ourselves 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.969
 and then yes no 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.849
 another plan if they were 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.199
 and now the ones a sun god full risk 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.009
 the eyes 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.119
 so 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:53.119
 we reproduce the animation 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.460
 and there they have this animation in flash 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.629
 I hope it has served
