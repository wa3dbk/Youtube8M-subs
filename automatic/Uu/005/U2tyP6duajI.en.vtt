review I do taste the tea in there but I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
review I do taste the tea in there but I
think<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> blueberry<00:01:25.799> lemonade<00:01:26.189> covers<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
think the blueberry lemonade covers it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.810 
think the blueberry lemonade covers it
up<00:01:26.850> quite<00:01:27.119> well<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.110> nice<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
up quite well this is really nice it is

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
up quite well this is really nice it is
about<00:01:29.820> 200<00:01:30.329> calories<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> entire<00:01:31.530> thing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
about 200 calories for the entire thing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
about 200 calories for the entire thing
which<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.909> bad<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> think

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
which is not that bad when you think

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
which is not that bad when you think
about<00:01:33.689> into<00:01:33.990> soda<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
about into soda is around that to you a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.440 
about into soda is around that to you a
little<00:01:35.490> less<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.090> around<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
little less but it's around that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
little less but it's around that
ballpark<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.040> got

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
ballpark so I like it I think it's got

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:38.929 
ballpark so I like it I think it's got
good<00:01:38.369> flavor

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
good flavor

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.240 
good flavor
I<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> snake<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.560> biting<00:01:41.130> into

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I like the snake right here biting into

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
I like the snake right here biting into
the<00:01:41.369> lemon<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:41.970> odd<00:01:42.090> reason<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.570> not

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the lemon for some odd reason I'm not
