00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.260 

interesting<00:04:28.690> little<00:04:28.930> gimmick<00:04:29.940> one<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.210> don't

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
interesting little gimmick one I don't

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.070 
interesting little gimmick one I don't
care<00:04:31.480> too<00:04:32.350> much<00:04:32.380> about<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:34.510> pretty<00:04:34.750> cool

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
care too much about but it's pretty cool

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.620 
care too much about but it's pretty cool
I<00:04:35.520> sort<00:04:36.520> of<00:04:36.580> wish<00:04:36.790> that<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.090> dome<00:04:37.360> was

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
I sort of wish that the dome was

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.260 
I sort of wish that the dome was
removable<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.550> can<00:04:39.730> move<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.090> head

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
removable so that you can move the head

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.940 
removable so that you can move the head
freely<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:43.360> some<00:04:44.140> toys<00:04:44.440> need<00:04:44.710> gimmicks

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
freely but the some toys need gimmicks

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.140 
freely but the some toys need gimmicks
every<00:04:45.310> now<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.640> then

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
every now and then

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.260 
every now and then
and<00:04:47.139> then<00:04:47.320> overall<00:04:47.860> it's<00:04:48.100> not<00:04:48.190> too<00:04:48.520> bad<00:04:51.270> so

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
and then overall it's not too bad so

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.290 
and then overall it's not too bad so
yeah<00:04:52.449> that's<00:04:52.720> my<00:04:52.780> little<00:04:52.900> review<00:04:53.290> on<00:04:54.300> the
