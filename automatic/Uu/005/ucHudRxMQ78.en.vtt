00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.910
 m 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.470
 Yes 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.249
 m 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.189
 after 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.990
 after 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.340
 for this day for a new video print so 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 they are not cases the small dishes cause since today's valentin the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 pleasure to go and see what their city 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.310
 gameplay presentation and a tenfold confidence what do you have 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.230
 could see exactly 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.830
 in fact we were treated to two levels of gray is super happy the first 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.270
 it was in decline in the '68s and the second city in 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.110
 a beautiful legend the united front 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.250
 the earth handicap 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.720
 so for all starts actually with tragedy like that it was really the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.740
 downtown this late rilke foundation 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.090
 we are already beset with offices half the pilgrims in the water 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 with the angels in the water not sorry 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.800
 more person to put down fast enough for the developer who 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 was the opportunity to play 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.040
 and then we recommend in another phase of play where we have a side a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.820
 little more infiltrations 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.580
 infiltration citypinte 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.810
 in which of the disc stay it's weird anyway that this comparative 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.180
 ration they do in the sense that you 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 all the level 7 points a lot of the levels go under the water 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.109
 final secretly faithful he place scissors 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.030
 of course some piles 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.420
 and so if you romance on an issue of a yard the VAT example of people 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.470
 who sleep in a dosage iraq and you you had discreetly and you put them 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.740
 hand on the mouth and flowers plants for earlier in the jugular 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 so you're more crazy like his little hattie site comes from behind he 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 takes good to it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 Mutuals nicely discreetly 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.960
 so those was really a plus a fixation point that who did not 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.650
 finally lasted since 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.300
 it shakes 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.970
 the charge of the enemies arrived then discretion his bankruptcy in all the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.600
 corners 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.350
 and percent so necessarily if suddenly the titillates 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 so in fact we find the atmosphere 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.869
 if you like to laugh 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.930
 a little bit silly in all directions it goes everywhere and they did in the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.859
 outbidding rate the rate of employment for example concretely this series 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.520
 always in the cycle of very scripted fabric 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.720
 from where does it once the tenth time it will seem to you fade 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.249
 but we still have explosions of massy enemies who arrive 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.280
 ap a key place opera and especially something that we felt in fact 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.839
 in the helicopter passage 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.089
 bourdoncle male developers therefore master more than tara parents of 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.459
 the zad we do not know if they had the opportunity to come back on some 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.479
 fields of 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.469
 those who could have gone before 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.609
 in fact 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.619
 we knew him exactly these scripts so it's his place 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:43.029
 helicopter in the right place c a bridge to shoot down a helicopter and a half 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.870
 who arrived in front of it so we always had the frame well 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.680
 placed for that and so bad blood booze actually fly 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.749
 things can still amaze her discussing with people 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.539
 who were with me 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.129
 we always have a 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.039
 a priori with treyarch development and politicians on policemen 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.869
 and in fact we really feel like more and the atmosphere of a modern 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.599
 warfare 2 of infinity ward 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.549
 but I married the question would be that 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.020
 the ccc developer still 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.190
 always without a big free week at the very same level of this 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.190
 which is actually there has also noted that the poor relative 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.910
 so you can our story frequently france 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 it's a book with the reinforcement of 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.930
 obama fadela now a year but it remains in this lineage necessarily 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.540
 even now for me anyway it's so pretty 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.669
 and seems to be stopped 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.509
 share in all directions it's inevitably we like it 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.899
 okay very well and to finish them some info on 8 players in addition to the 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.699
 all or nothing at all or nothing at all that's really enough about the solo and 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.769
 yields 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.900
 we will listen very well to them that it will be enough for the said so that I 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.819
 think we've done in ten years it's a little bit we've seen from this 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.980
 that you have more and more early 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.880
 he was very soon for a new video of the season
