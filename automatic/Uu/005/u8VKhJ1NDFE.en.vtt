00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
board now the landing board is a little

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.900 
board now the landing board is a little
more<00:01:23.950> interesting<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:25.300> do<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:26.080> can<00:01:26.260> see<00:01:26.470> here

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
more interesting to do you can see here

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.720 
more interesting to do you can see here
that<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:29.470> had<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.800> take<00:01:29.980> time<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.280> get<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
that we had to take time to get the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.330 
that we had to take time to get the
paint<00:01:30.970> into<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.420> roosting<00:01:31.900> grooves<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.530> to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
paint into the roosting grooves and to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.940 
paint into the roosting grooves and to
fully<00:01:33.730> coat<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:35.050> painted<00:01:35.380> up<00:01:35.620> into

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
fully coat it and it's painted up into

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.580 
fully coat it and it's painted up into
the<00:01:36.040> house<00:01:36.220> just<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.730> little<00:01:36.970> bit<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:38.260> it's<00:01:38.440> not

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the house just a little bit but it's not

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.040 
the house just a little bit but it's not
important<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.340> actually<00:01:39.940> go<00:01:40.090> inside<00:01:40.360> the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
important to actually go inside the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.850 
important to actually go inside the
house<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.290> paint<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:43.270> use<00:01:43.510> a<00:01:43.860> exterior-grade

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
house and paint we use a exterior-grade

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.500 
house and paint we use a exterior-grade
plywood<00:01:46.500> called<00:01:47.500> AC<00:01:47.680> X<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.790> has<00:01:48.940> an<00:01:49.090> exterior

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
plywood called AC X it has an exterior

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.720 
plywood called AC X it has an exterior
glue<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.920> doesn't<00:01:51.159> mean<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.460> it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
glue in it this doesn't mean that it's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.630 
glue in it this doesn't mean that it's
impervious<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:53.350> outdoors<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:54.130> means<00:01:54.340> that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
impervious to the outdoors it means that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.899 
impervious to the outdoors it means that
the<00:01:54.760> glue<00:01:55.030> won't<00:01:55.300> break<00:01:55.600> down<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:56.050> moisture

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the glue won't break down with moisture

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.610 
the glue won't break down with moisture
so<00:01:57.909> any<00:01:58.120> splits<00:01:58.540> or<00:01:58.750> cracks<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.290> may<00:01:59.470> develop

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
so any splits or cracks that may develop

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.969 
so any splits or cracks that may develop
over<00:01:59.950> time<00:02:00.930> should<00:02:01.930> not<00:02:02.140> cause<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.650> entire

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
over time should not cause the entire

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.870 
over time should not cause the entire
surface<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.729> delaminate<00:02:04.090> wallets<00:02:04.800> outside

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
surface to delaminate wallets outside

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.999 
surface to delaminate wallets outside
now<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.940> can<00:02:07.180> see<00:02:07.330> this<00:02:07.510> house<00:02:07.750> which<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.800> new

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
now you can see this house which is new

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.030 
now you can see this house which is new
it's<00:02:09.459> ready<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.060> ship<00:02:10.290> does<00:02:11.290> actually<00:02:11.800> have<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
it's ready to ship does actually have a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.869 
it's ready to ship does actually have a
small<00:02:13.110> gap<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.799> plywood<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.489> this

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
small gap here in the plywood and this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and painted when the sunlight hits this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.870 
and painted when the sunlight hits this
plywood<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:22.379> exterior<00:02:23.379> surface<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.520> is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
plywood the exterior surface of this is

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480 
plywood the exterior surface of this is
going<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.360> develop<00:02:25.990> small<00:02:26.500> fissures<00:02:27.040> that's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
going to develop small fissures that's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.240 
going to develop small fissures that's
completely

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
completely

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.610 
completely
was<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:29.420> how<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.600> plywood<00:02:30.080> reacts<00:02:30.410> to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
was just how the plywood reacts to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.700 
was just how the plywood reacts to
sunlight<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.160> works<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.460> same<00:02:31.670> way<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:31.910> houses

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
sunlight it works the same way on houses

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.200 
sunlight it works the same way on houses
and<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.830> doesn't<00:02:34.130> harm<00:02:34.280> anything<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
and it doesn't harm anything because the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.980 
and it doesn't harm anything because the
plywood<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.960> durable<00:02:37.360> waterproof<00:02:38.360> glue<00:02:38.780> on

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
the inside of it and it's not going to

the inside of it and it's not going to
get<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.480> cause<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.960> delaminate<00:02:42.140> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
get in and cause it to delaminate and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.100 
get in and cause it to delaminate and
come<00:02:42.860> apart

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
come apart

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.660

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
you put it in bright hot sunlight it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.460 
you put it in bright hot sunlight it's
going<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.670> get<00:03:46.760> extremely<00:03:47.390> hot<00:03:47.750> inside<00:03:48.110> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
going to get extremely hot inside the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.229 
going to get extremely hot inside the
house<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.950> it's<00:03:49.459> going<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.820> cause<00:03:50.000> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
house and it's going to cause the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.440 
house and it's going to cause the
plywood<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:51.130> buckle<00:03:52.130> swell<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.820> split<00:03:53.120> even

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
plywood to buckle swell and split even

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
plywood to buckle swell and split even
faster<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> black<00:03:54.590> house<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:55.100> not<00:03:55.250> something

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
faster so a black house is not something

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.830 
faster so a black house is not something
