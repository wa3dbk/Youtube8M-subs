wax<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.990> google<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.800> plan<00:00:11.010> how<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
wax you can google that and plan how to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
wax you can google that and plan how to
make<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> then<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> covered<00:00:12.719> which

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
make it and then I have a covered which

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.700 
make it and then I have a covered which
is<00:00:13.110> actually<00:00:13.230> from<00:00:13.469> another<00:00:15.500> tuna<00:00:16.500> can

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
