now with this particular anime I had

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
now with this particular anime I had

curious<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.210> takes

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
curious as to when this actually takes

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
curious as to when this actually takes
place<00:00:39.540> within<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> Soul<00:00:40.230> Eater<00:00:40.379> universe

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
place within the Soul Eater universe

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
place within the Soul Eater universe
because<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.430> Sid<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> still<00:00:42.090> alive

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
because you see that Sid is still alive

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.690 
because you see that Sid is still alive
but<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.290> also<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> Medusa<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but you also see that Medusa is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
but you also see that Medusa is
apparently<00:00:45.239> already<00:00:45.510> working<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.260> like

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
apparently already working there so like

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
apparently already working there so like
does<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> take<00:00:47.129> place<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.610> between<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
does this take place in between like the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
does this take place in between like the
beginning<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> Soul<00:00:49.710> Eater<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.219> actually

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
beginning of Soul Eater there's actually

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
beginning of Soul Eater there's actually
some<00:00:50.789> confusion<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.989> does<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
some confusion as to when does this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
some confusion as to when does this
exactly<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.250> place<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
exactly take place and you also have a

a lot more busty you got a mocking soul

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
a lot more busty you got a mocking soul
soul<00:01:07.619> looks<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.280> he's<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
soul looks a little bit like he's like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
soul looks a little bit like he's like
hi<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.210> some<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.530> maka

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
hi or some and then you got maka

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
hi or some and then you got maka
there<00:01:11.010> she<00:01:11.159> looks<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> most<00:01:11.790> part<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
there she looks for the most part the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.429 
there she looks for the most part the
same<00:01:12.240> maybe<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.260> bit

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
same maybe so it's a little bit

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
same maybe so it's a little bit
different<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.830> far<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.010> her<00:01:14.189> art<00:01:14.400> style<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> was

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
different as far as her art style it was

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.460 
different as far as her art style it was
nice<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.600> cameos<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.259> them

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
nice to get the little cameos from them

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.719 
nice to get the little cameos from them
so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> guess<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.400> enjoyable

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so I guess that was kind of enjoyable

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.190 
so I guess that was kind of enjoyable
now<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.180> far<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> main<00:01:18.630> characters<00:01:19.049> go

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
now as far as the main characters go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.510 
now as far as the main characters go
they're<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.439> anything<00:01:20.070> particularly

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
they're not anything particularly

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.039 
they're not anything particularly
Express<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.450> main<00:01:21.600> character

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
Express you got the main character

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
Express you got the main character
tsunami<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:23.040> much<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.490> found<00:01:23.729> out

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
sense that this kind of expanded upon

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.170 
sense that this kind of expanded upon
the<00:01:29.009> Soul<00:01:29.189> Eater<00:01:29.220> universe<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.060> bit

the Soul Eater universe a little bit

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.520 
the Soul Eater universe a little bit

really expanded into the normalcy of the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
really expanded into the normalcy of the

as though for the most part the humans
are<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.829> yeah<00:01:53.159> once<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.360> weapon

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
don't you think I thought it was good

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.990 
don't you think I thought it was good
introduction<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.070> set<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.820> what's

again<00:02:01.860> very<00:02:02.219> low<00:02:02.490> expectations<00:02:03.270> coming<00:02:03.450> into

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
again very low expectations coming into

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
again very low expectations coming into
this<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> thought<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.469> good<00:02:04.740> maybe

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this I just thought it was good maybe

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
this I just thought it was good maybe
it's<00:02:05.490> some<00:02:05.759> milk<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> or<00:02:06.270> whatever<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.689> as<00:02:06.899> far

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's some milk is or whatever but as far

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
it's some milk is or whatever but as far
as<00:02:07.200> art<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.560> animation<00:02:07.710> goes<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
as art and animation goes that really it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.260 
as art and animation goes that really it
was<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> good<00:02:09.330> check<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.319> thought<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
was a good check I really thought that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.090 
was a good check I really thought that
in<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.600> art<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.050> looked<00:02:12.230> real<00:02:12.440> nice<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:13.010> was

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
in the art it looked real nice it was

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.830 
in the art it looked real nice it was
like<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.490> buildings<00:02:13.970> had<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> nice<00:02:14.360> vibe<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.810> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
like the buildings had a nice vibe to it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.660 
like the buildings had a nice vibe to it
almost<00:02:15.110> looked<00:02:15.350> 3d<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.190> way<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.550> the

smiling and just as a whole I felt that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.610 
smiling and just as a whole I felt that
still<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.540> art<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.870> animation<00:02:21.050> was<00:02:21.440> just

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
of like bland rookies so in a sense the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.710 
of like bland rookies so in a sense the
characters<00:03:07.340> aren't<00:03:07.550> all<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.090> amazing<00:03:08.300> thus

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
characters aren't all that amazing thus

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.300 
characters aren't all that amazing thus
far<00:03:08.960> they<00:03:09.110> were<00:03:09.170> nice<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.710> they<00:03:09.920> had<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.070> little

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
far they were nice and they had a little

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.470 
far they were nice and they had a little
trog<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.700> them<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.030> they<00:03:11.120> weren't<00:03:11.270> as

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
trog to them but they weren't as

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.540 
trog to them but they weren't as
exciting<00:03:12.080> or<00:03:12.170> over-the-top<00:03:12.770> as<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.370> leave

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
exciting or over-the-top as so leave

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.890 
exciting or over-the-top as so leave
your<00:03:13.670> characters<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.390> sense<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.720> guess

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
your characters and in a sense I guess

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.449 
your characters and in a sense I guess
they<00:03:15.020> don't<00:03:15.230> need<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> be<00:03:15.680> because<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> end

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
they don't need to be because at the end

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.190 
they don't need to be because at the end
of<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> day<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.030> called<00:03:17.270> Soul<00:03:17.540> Eater<00:03:17.780> not

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
of the day it is called Soul Eater not

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900 
of the day it is called Soul Eater not
so<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.830> not<00:03:18.980> your<00:03:19.160> typical<00:03:19.280> Soul<00:03:19.760> Eater

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
so this is not your typical Soul Eater

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.340 
so this is not your typical Soul Eater
you're<00:03:20.150> not<00:03:20.270> gonna<00:03:20.390> get<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.720> same<00:03:20.870> vibe<00:03:21.140> from

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
you're not gonna get the same vibe from

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.110 
you're not gonna get the same vibe from
it<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.650> not<00:03:21.709> gonna<00:03:21.860> be<00:03:22.040> as<00:03:22.190> wacky<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:23.000> looks

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
it it's not gonna be as wacky it looks

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.880 
it it's not gonna be as wacky it looks
like<00:03:23.240> it's<00:03:23.390> more<00:03:23.480> rounded<00:03:24.080> towards<00:03:24.380> in<00:03:24.530> a

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
like it's more rounded towards in a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.010 
like it's more rounded towards in a
sense<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> certain<00:03:25.640> sense<00:03:25.790> reality<00:03:26.720> as<00:03:26.840> far

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
sense in a certain sense reality as far

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.940 
sense in a certain sense reality as far
as<00:03:27.110> like<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.350> characters<00:03:27.709> are<00:03:27.830> more

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
as like the characters are more

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.370 
as like the characters are more
realistic<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.730> less<00:03:29.209> like<00:03:29.390> crazy<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.110> saini

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
realistic and less like crazy and saini

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.600 
realistic and less like crazy and saini
but<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.890> was<00:03:30.980> one<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.280> best<00:03:31.459> things

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
but that was one of the best things

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.100 
but that was one of the best things
about<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.030> leader<00:03:32.300> one<00:03:32.510> thing<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:32.990> made

you like them because the characters

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.490 
you like them because the characters
just<00:03:34.550> had<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.000> much<00:03:35.150> personality<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:36.020> them<00:03:36.290> and

anything<00:03:56.959> like<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.470> as<00:03:57.560> far<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.770> there

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
anything like that and as far as there

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
anything like that and as far as there
being<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.160> prequel<00:03:58.580> I'm<00:03:58.790> not<00:03:58.970> exactly<00:03:59.240> sure

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
being a prequel I'm not exactly sure

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
when does it take place but it was a

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.740 
when does it take place but it was a
pretty<00:04:01.580> decent<00:04:01.940> episode<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:02.300> fell<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.630> our

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
pretty decent episode I fell to our

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.600 
pretty decent episode I fell to our
animation<00:04:03.200> check<00:04:03.590> music<00:04:04.160> was<00:04:04.310> alright

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
animation check music was alright

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.949 
animation check music was alright
nothing<00:04:04.790> standing<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.450> in<00:04:05.570> this<00:04:05.720> particular

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
nothing standing out in this particular

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.930 
nothing standing out in this particular
first<00:04:06.290> episode<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.310> main<00:04:07.489> characters

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
first episode and the main characters

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.820 
first episode and the main characters
are<00:04:08.090> not<00:04:08.209> all<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.690> exciting<00:04:09.170> but<00:04:09.320> again<00:04:09.560> like

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
are not all that exciting but again like

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.530 
are not all that exciting but again like
it's<00:04:10.040> solely<00:04:10.280> or<00:04:10.520> not<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.060> guess<00:04:11.360> they're

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
it's solely or not so I guess they're

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.910 
it's solely or not so I guess they're
not<00:04:11.690> supposed<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.230> be<00:04:12.350> like<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.709> Soul<00:04:12.890> Eater

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
not supposed to be like the Soul Eater

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.560 
not supposed to be like the Soul Eater
characters<00:04:13.459> but<00:04:13.880> they<00:04:14.090> did<00:04:14.270> have<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> little

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
characters but they did have a little

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.670 
characters but they did have a little
charm<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.020> them<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.320> felt<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:15.650> though

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
charm to them and I felt as though
