do<00:00:29.090> these<00:00:30.090> things<00:00:30.300> refresh<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.140> every

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
do these things refresh I think every

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100 
do these things refresh I think every
two<00:00:31.679> days<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.630> looking<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:33.960> right

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
two days so the one I'm looking at right

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.220 
two days so the one I'm looking at right
now<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.280> pretty<00:00:35.579> difficult<00:00:36.050> you're<00:00:37.050> down

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
now is is pretty difficult you're down

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
now is is pretty difficult you're down
on<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:37.649> goal<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.160> Real<00:00:38.309> Madrid<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
on one goal to Real Madrid you have to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.709 
on one goal to Real Madrid you have to
score<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.570> goals<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:41.070> under<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> half<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.180> for

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
score two goals in under a half so for

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
score two goals in under a half so for
me<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> something<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.800> avoid<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.370> one

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
me it's something I would avoid this one

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
me it's something I would avoid this one
I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.510> myself<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.050> spent<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.530> two<00:00:46.860> hours

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I think myself I spent about two hours

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
I think myself I spent about two hours
playing<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.940> else<00:00:48.090> Chelsea<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
playing one where else Chelsea and I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
minutes which is too difficult and I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
minutes which is too difficult and I
spent<00:00:52.289> too<00:00:52.440> much<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> my

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
spent too much time on it so my

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
spent too much time on it so my
