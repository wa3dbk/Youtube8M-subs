00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.220
 Dear friends, here we are back to our jersey information page 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.230
 sports 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.100
 I start a question that might seem stupid out of context 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.669
 or 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.669
 this cd ethercat an illegal product 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.199
 you cd mastered like so many at this point would be wondering if the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 Burner is not an illegal tool what allows us 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.609
 to falsify what an original product but otherwise does not 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.429
 that directly installed burner would lose computers like these 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.230
 inside of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.109
 in the portable burner 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.359
 through these of correlabili it is connected pittan same computers for 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.510
 this reason we can say that the cd mastered as well as the 

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.579
 burner are not legal products 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.570
 if ever legal 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.310
 Lazio turlupinare selling couples illegally and not for use 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.160
 staff 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.649
 decide in question 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.379
 at this point the question of the protection of music would fail but 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.570
 what has all this got to do with the question of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.210
 in the sport of sports and well-worn sweaters 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.480
 make you understand 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.330
 that I want to explain to me they arrive tomorrow is really identical but really 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.100
 identical 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.850
 freely identifiable movies we have that are here are the shirts 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.400
 inter 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 only the size 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.070
 It is different 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.109
 this maybe you can also see an animal this maybe we'll see 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.529
 unix every detail is particular of these hands correspond original but 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:34.659
 probably indeed an original and the other no we go to 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.659
 find out by accident 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.460
 once the shirt is open we could also zoomable and quietly 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.940
 look at them in front 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.660
 all the details are identical 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.340
 and even on the back it is so but for reasons of time we will see it only 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 quickly 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.209
 milito 22 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.629
 private-labeled numbers caccamo seems just all original mito22 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.939
 also this delaying net 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.400
 but that I try to make any difference I make a small problem that one of these 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.599
 shirts we bought authorized merchandise in a store 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 and to this beautiful nike tag 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.049
 with all the technical research the first one any way and so on 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:34.740
 etc 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.660
 and also this shirt that we didn't buy in the nike shop 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.399
 but that a very nice time I expect from Thailand 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.529
 at the same identical card 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.529
 in the mail 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.609
 with all the technical specifications 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.019
 now this user I want to keep anonymous 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.329
 it's a question of saying so 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.120
 i privacy protection reassures me proof that your shirt 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.430
 starting from Italy is his home 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.259
 while then I got a nice package from Thailand 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.709
 Now what I say is if these hands are identical in every minimum 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.999
 unmistakable detail 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.440
 it is absolutely impossible 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.060
 from the engine to the determined color 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.870
 issues are also tac 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.369
 I also showed them to these blessed carterini 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.719
 impossible to distinguish it 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.939
 how can I think that the nyt 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.390
 original to be produced in Thailand 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.889
 instead of in europe in america or in the areas we say where produced 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.109
 we keep thinking that you are original 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.849
 at this point the undersigned has made a nice call to the customs 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.280
 when some of the issues have been blocked due to frightening times they say 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.939
 abroad program for which I asked 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.989
 if it were regular, import these t-shirts and if it was roma the originals 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.980
 incredibly he replied 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.300
 we don't know we can't know 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.750
 honestly we can only say that it is better not to import large quantities 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.559
 from abroad 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:05.809
 because it dresses more easily that these are blocked ebay - 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.779
 analyzed searched but then eventually 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.970
 from this analysis what is it that these meshes are still possible 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.909
 subject to customs clearance fee sent 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.090
 to the recipient because they are absolutely not 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.719
 counterfeit at this point I wonder 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.259
 but it is not by chance that the products of narnia adidas and nike puma etcetera 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.259
 etc. well not really produced 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.080
 in the Asian close 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.490
 pui 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.789
 who uses European and Italian shops 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.020
 I only have one intermediation step 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.330
 so perhaps the original popilio and the Asian counterpart does not exist but it is 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.189
 all original 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.610
 at this point these questions could be identical original questions in 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.330
 trance only that this I was looking for an eye of the head because I do not pressure 

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:54.409
 Italian courts 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.289
 the one I was looking for was much less because a user sold it to us to send it to us 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:04:59.939
 directly 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.860
 from the manufacturer in anxiety 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.249
 in this case from Thailand 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.960
 running we risk buying this, customs cannot tell us 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.350
 expect better times
