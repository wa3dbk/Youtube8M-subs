00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.449
 yes hello had come back here 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.390
 I want you a video blog today 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.750
 Introducing a new gadget 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.340
 has kept in my studio and that is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.580
 honestly 1 where I am very very 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.929
 I'm looking for a long time and I like it 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.420
 short facebook introduced now though 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:39.010
 I expect quite a lot of therapy 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.010
 the rest of the year it is synonymous with sony and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.140
 problem is always clear for example if 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.440
 I measure up or shoot at shootings 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.530
 make these little usb plug the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.870
 Slipping damn often out and then 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.910
 terminates the connection to the extension 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.829
 and and and that's all very much 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.949
 very annoying audience I see what 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.739
 I do but plug goes out and the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.170
 company goalie oldie has here 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.190
 Products on the market specifically 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.200
 So that's what it starts with 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.250
 the tripod is not a tournament though 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.179
 the bracket for this my macbook gives 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.750
 These plates fit different 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.970
 laptop sizes 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.640
 the pad is not my laptop 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.759
 I can slip here again 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.340
 at the fortification that even if I 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.759
 should come across or so that my 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.929
 laptop because it does not fall off that 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.890
 secured is so to speak 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.110
 but for me that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.600
 most important because we are a system that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.850
 so-called jÃ¶rg stolper this is this 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.110
 part here consists of two share the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 one is here on the usb cable to the other 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.490
 end I have his permanently normal 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.050
 Camera and that is a strain relief 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.300
 makes just purely had a 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.970
 huge advantage 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 I have here you can buy the one here 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.960
 cable limit when I loop 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.570
 here big enough experts and the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:18.790
 Camera, I can just here on the cable 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.830
 pull happens so often that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.130
 you train a little too much here 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.989
 There are draws here but where to usb 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.070
 Cable stays safely in the camera 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.200
 So since I Workers with the system 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.180
 I have no more failures on the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.540
 stage or at other shootings 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.420
 and yes I am building on the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.459
 same product shooting now there too 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.350
 Of course, the camera always stops here 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.920
 you still stay on a tripod 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.570
 hang cables and therefore theme tools 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.340
 is something I do not care for anymore 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.900
 wants to miss gives our exciting 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.239
 gadgets again below does not show up 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.470
 sometimes in close up still the possibility 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.740
 for example because 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.450
 power adapter the macbook since that 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.040
 to chain tripod so a very 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.040
 thoughtful system 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.290
 I have to this normal cable too 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.780
 another extension around the whole 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 just too often there are also often 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.900
 the need for that, for example, the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.730
 retro relative to a beamer 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.800
 Projector must stand and not on the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.160
 then I can do it all again 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.450
 extend and it works too 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.840
 absolutely problem-free even over larger ones 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.390
 stretch with the usb extension enough 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.270
 Gelabert just look at me 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.780
 you need the shop left round and 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.550
 the video and not only me 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.110
 tell her you also get a little mac 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.240
 on a shooting as goodie on top 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.420
 we'll see each other again soon 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.420
 thanks
