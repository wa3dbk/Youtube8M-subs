believe all the Catholics cost 400 k
tokens<00:01:34.680> apiece<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.549> someone<00:01:35.820> correct<00:01:36.030> me

had the level 80 requirement still but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
had the level 80 requirement still but
they<00:01:41.610> lowered<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> token<00:01:42.600> cost<00:01:43.049> after<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
they lowered the token cost after that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
they lowered the token cost after that
because<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.280> didn't<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.820> sense<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
because it didn't really make sense to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
because it didn't really make sense to
have<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> couldn't<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> at

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
have it so I that you couldn't get it at

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.420 
have it so I that you couldn't get it at
the<00:01:47.220> level<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.909> required<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.439> anyway<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the level that it required so anyway you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.240 
the level that it required so anyway you
can<00:01:50.610> buy<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.850> 400<00:01:51.329> k<00:01:51.509> tokens<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.070> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can buy it 400 k tokens and then you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.429 
can buy it 400 k tokens and then you can
talk<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> toggle<00:01:54.600> through<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.110> couple

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
talk to it and toggle through a couple

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.620 
talk to it and toggle through a couple
options<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:56.969> actually<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.450> one

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
options and well actually just one

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
options and well actually just one
option<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:58.979> four<00:01:59.159> different

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
option really but with four different

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
option really but with four different
parts<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.930> consume

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
parts in it you can have it consume

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.219 
parts in it you can have it consume
charms<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.479> give<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:04.049> bit

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
charms and it will give you a little bit

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.080 
charms and it will give you a little bit
of<00:02:04.320> experience<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.979> them<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.909> not

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
of experience for them it's really not

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.670 
of experience for them it's really not
worth<00:02:06.149> while<00:02:06.570> unless<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.530> want

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
worth while unless you just don't want

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
worth while unless you just don't want
those<00:02:07.829> charms<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.489> your<00:02:08.610> inventory<00:02:09.000> you

those charms going to your inventory you
only<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:10.020> four<00:02:10.319> experience<00:02:10.830> /<00:02:11.129> gold<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.239> /

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.630 
not worth while at all in terms of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that like if you don't want gold charms

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.600 
that like if you don't want gold charms
you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> use<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.980> would<00:02:23.550> be

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
you can have it use it up would be

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.980 
you can have it use it up would be
interesting<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.270> they've<00:02:24.390> made<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.630> scale

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
interesting that they've made it scale

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.450 
interesting that they've made it scale
to<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.290> level<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.070> more<00:02:26.250> worthwhile

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
to your level so it was more worthwhile

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.430 
to your level so it was more worthwhile
but<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.240> suppose<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.840> fine<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.050> mean<00:02:28.320> you're

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
but I suppose it's fine I mean you're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.020 
but I suppose it's fine I mean you're
getting<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.370> charms<00:02:29.670> picked<00:02:29.880> up

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
getting the charms picked up

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
getting the charms picked up
automatically<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.840> can't<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.560> complain

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
automatically so can't really complain

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.280 
automatically so can't really complain
too<00:02:32.130> much<00:02:32.160> about<00:02:32.340> any<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:34.110> last

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
too much about any of it really one last

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.960 
too much about any of it really one last
thing<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> note<00:02:34.770> about<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.160> charming<00:02:35.610> imp<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
thing to note about the charming imp is

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.090 
thing to note about the charming imp is
it<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.390> has<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> destroyed<00:02:37.260> right<00:02:37.500> click<00:02:37.740> option

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it it has a destroyed right click option

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.700 
it it has a destroyed right click option
so<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> die<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.270> it's<00:02:39.690> probably<00:02:40.500> gone

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
so if you die with it it's probably gone

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.140 
so if you die with it it's probably gone
forever<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.430> testing<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.910> out<00:02:41.940> myself

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
forever I'm not testing it out myself

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.660 
forever I'm not testing it out myself
but<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.590> careful<00:02:43.620> about<00:02:44.100> dying<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.490> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
but just be careful about dying with it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
but just be careful about dying with it
you<00:02:44.730> don't<00:02:44.910> want<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> lose<00:02:45.540> 100<00:02:45.750> kid<00:02:46.080> tokens

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
you don't want to lose 100 kid tokens

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.070 
you don't want to lose 100 kid tokens
for<00:02:46.590> no<00:02:46.710> reason<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> yep<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:48.960> for

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
for no reason so yep that's really for

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.380 
for no reason so yep that's really for
this<00:02:49.230> video<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.890> little<00:02:50.370> bit<00:02:50.880> about<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
this video just a little bit about the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
this video just a little bit about the
recent<00:02:51.600> updates<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.230> am<00:02:52.740> interested<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.340> see

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
recent updates I am interested to see

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.660 
recent updates I am interested to see
what<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:55.040> Dungeoneering<00:02:56.040> dual<00:02:56.220> wields<00:02:56.580> are

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
what the Dungeoneering dual wields are

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.580 
what the Dungeoneering dual wields are
going<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.910> be<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.120> although<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:58.080> not<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
going to be like although I'm not I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
going to be like although I'm not I
can't<00:02:59.010> really<00:02:59.190> imagine<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.760> will<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.910> better

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can't really imagine that will be better

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
can't really imagine that will be better
than<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.950> two-handed<00:03:01.950> ones<00:03:02.160> since<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:03.360> least

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
than the two-handed ones since at least

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270 
than the two-handed ones since at least
theoretically<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:04.290> both<00:03:04.770> one<00:03:04.920> hundred<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
theoretically it's both one hundred and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.140 
theoretically it's both one hundred and
fifty<00:03:05.910> percent<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> damage<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
fifty percent of the damage for I a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.240 
fifty percent of the damage for I a
one-handed<00:03:09.150> weapon<00:03:09.450> at<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.720> level<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.920> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
one-handed weapon at that level but it I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.560 
one-handed weapon at that level but it I
don't<00:03:11.670> know<00:03:11.730> some<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.150> might<00:03:12.270> be<00:03:12.420> pretty

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
don't know some that might be pretty

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.360 
don't know some that might be pretty
cool-looking<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.680> let's<00:03:13.860> relate<00:03:14.100> for<00:03:14.280> this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
cool-looking so let's relate for this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.040 
cool-looking so let's relate for this
