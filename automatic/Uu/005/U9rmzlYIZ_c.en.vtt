on<00:01:09.969> our<00:01:10.090> bike<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.899> have<00:01:11.049> a<00:01:11.079> key<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.439> power

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
on our bike we have a key of power

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.800 
on our bike we have a key of power
system<00:01:12.130> installed<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:13.149> let's<00:01:13.180> have<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.570> look

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
system installed so let's have a look

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.289 
system installed so let's have a look
and<00:01:14.049> see<00:01:14.439> exactly<00:01:14.770> how<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.280> system<00:01:15.640> works

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
and see exactly how the system works

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.450 
and see exactly how the system works
and<00:01:16.810> more<00:01:17.049> importantly<00:01:17.439> let's<00:01:17.680> see<00:01:17.890> also<00:01:18.100> all

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and more importantly let's see also all

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.609 
and more importantly let's see also all
the<00:01:18.640> benefits<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.659> system<00:01:19.990> offers<00:01:20.439> me

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the benefits that the system offers me

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.010 
the benefits that the system offers me
as<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.159> rider

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
as a rider

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630 
as a rider
kiyo<00:01:23.020> power<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.710> world's<00:01:23.979> first<00:01:24.219> pedal

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
kiyo power is the world's first pedal

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.090 
kiyo power is the world's first pedal
based<00:01:24.969> power<00:01:25.299> meter<00:01:25.600> why<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.590> important

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
based power meter why is that important

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.609 
based power meter why is that important
well<00:01:27.280> there<00:01:28.180> are<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.329> couple<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.750> reasons<00:01:28.899> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
well there are a couple of reasons the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.670 
well there are a couple of reasons the
first<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.299> pedal<00:01:31.689> is<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.380> first

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
first is that the pedal is the first

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.039 
first is that the pedal is the first
contact<00:01:33.310> point<00:01:33.549> between<00:01:33.789> rider<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.689> bike

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
contact point between rider and the bike

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.440 
contact point between rider and the bike
so<00:01:35.560> here<00:01:35.950> we're<00:01:36.159> measuring<00:01:36.399> all<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.270> power

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
so here we're measuring all of the power

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.690 
so here we're measuring all of the power
that's<00:01:38.140> being<00:01:38.259> transferred<00:01:38.920> from<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.490> rider

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
that's being transferred from the rider

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.209 
that's being transferred from the rider
to<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.210> bike<00:01:40.420> we're<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:41.079> losing<00:01:41.350> any<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
to the bike we're not losing any of the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.760 
to the bike we're not losing any of the
power<00:01:42.430> through<00:01:43.180> flexing<00:01:43.719> of<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.079> components

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
power through flexing of the components

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.980 
power through flexing of the components
of<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.189> crank<00:01:45.460> through<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.179> transmission<00:01:46.810> or

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
of the crank through the transmission or

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.980 
of the crank through the transmission or
from<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> wheel<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.640> second<00:01:49.060> reason<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.509> that

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
from the wheel the second reason is that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.139 
from the wheel the second reason is that
on<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.380> bike<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:51.070> have<00:01:51.219> two<00:01:51.429> pedals<00:01:51.820> and

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
on the bike we have two pedals and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.050 
on the bike we have two pedals and
that's<00:01:52.780> very<00:01:53.020> important<00:01:53.530> because<00:01:53.770> now<00:01:54.130> we're

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
that's very important because now we're

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.760 
that's very important because now we're
measuring<00:01:55.270> power<00:01:55.780> from<00:01:56.350> each<00:01:56.500> leg

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
measuring power from each leg

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.160 
measuring power from each leg
independently<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.539> see<00:01:58.749> not<00:01:58.899> only<00:01:58.960> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
independently so I can see not only the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.590 
independently so I can see not only the
total<00:01:59.469> power<00:01:59.829> output<00:01:59.979> when<00:02:00.609> I'm<00:02:00.729> riding<00:02:00.909> but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
total power output when I'm riding but

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.380 
total power output when I'm riding but
also<00:02:01.810> how<00:02:02.469> that<00:02:02.740> power<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.490> made<00:02:03.789> up<00:02:03.939> between

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
also how that power is made up between

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.080 
also how that power is made up between
left<00:02:04.600> leg<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.049> right<00:02:05.679> leg<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.759> lets<00:02:06.999> me

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
left leg and right leg and that lets me

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.150 
left leg and right leg and that lets me
work<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.539> my<00:02:07.600> pedaling<00:02:08.110> technique<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:09.009> it

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
work on my pedaling technique and it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.680 
work on my pedaling technique and it
helps<00:02:09.490> me<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.670> even<00:02:09.970> out<00:02:10.210> any<00:02:10.360> imbalances

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
helps me to even out any imbalances

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.270 
helps me to even out any imbalances
the<00:02:11.840> left<00:02:12.020> leg<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.650> right<00:02:12.680> leg<00:02:12.980> and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the left leg and the right leg and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
the left leg and the right leg and
that's<00:02:13.760> something<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.450> no<00:02:14.990> other<00:02:15.020> current

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that's something that no other current

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.500 
that's something that no other current
power<00:02:15.860> meter<00:02:16.100> can<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.460> let's<00:02:16.970> look<00:02:17.210> at<00:02:17.360> the

power meter can do let's look at the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.690 
power meter can do let's look at the
other<00:02:17.570> half<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> system<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.340> see

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
other half of the system you can see

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.720 
other half of the system you can see
that<00:02:20.270> connected<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.780> each<00:02:20.990> pedal<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that connected to each pedal we have a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.550 
that connected to each pedal we have a
polar<00:02:23.740> p5<00:02:24.740> power<00:02:25.160> sensor<00:02:25.900> let's<00:02:26.900> explain<00:02:27.260> what

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
polar p5 power sensor let's explain what

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.420 
polar p5 power sensor let's explain what
these<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.300> first<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.450> all<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.920> house<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
these do first of all they house the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.060 
these do first of all they house the
