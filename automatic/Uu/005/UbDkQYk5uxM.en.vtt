I have found where you can get in an
assignment<00:00:42.239> swish<00:00:42.480> assignments<00:00:43.230> wishes<00:00:43.590> from

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
assignment swish assignments wishes from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
assignment swish assignments wishes from
last<00:00:44.040> year<00:00:44.309> pretty<00:00:44.579> much<00:00:44.670> dead<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
last year pretty much dead this is a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
last year pretty much dead this is a
little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.129> anything

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
little bit different it's not anything

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
little bit different it's not anything
like<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.570> last<00:00:48.840> year<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.770> still

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like it was last year but it's still

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
like it was last year but it's still
extremely<00:00:50.280> effective<00:00:50.670> against<00:00:51.390> man<00:00:51.629> coverage

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
extremely effective against man coverage

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.100 
extremely effective against man coverage
so<00:00:52.289> let's<00:00:52.440> take<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> look<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.930> notice<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so let's take a look here notice how the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
so let's take a look here notice how the
assignments<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.160> finley<00:00:56.670> ends<00:00:57.000> up

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
assignments which and finley ends up

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
assignments which and finley ends up
being<00:00:57.329> guarded<00:00:57.600> by<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> middle<00:00:58.230> linebacker

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
being guarded by the middle linebacker

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.750 
being guarded by the middle linebacker
who's<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> middle<00:00:59.460> field<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.930> will

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
who's in the middle field this play will

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
who's in the middle field this play will
basically<00:01:02.760> allow<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.290> tear<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.769> man

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
basically allow you to tear up man

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.490 
basically allow you to tear up man
coverage<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.180> read<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.260> best

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
coverage with just one read the best

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.440 
coverage with just one read the best
part<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.920> works<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> both<00:01:09.090> sides<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> field

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
part is works to both sides of the field

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
part is works to both sides of the field
so<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.260> side<00:01:13.580> take<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so if we want to do this side take a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
so if we want to do this side take a
look<00:01:14.790> again<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> magma<00:01:16.140> should<00:01:16.320> be

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
look again bit a lot of magma should be

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.340 
look again bit a lot of magma should be
carding<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> running<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.330> but<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:19.140> going

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
carding the running back but not going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.480 
carding the running back but not going
to<00:01:19.409> happen<00:01:19.759> wide<00:01:20.759> open<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.270> sidelines<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
to happen wide open on sidelines and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.179

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
even better guys this same setup looks

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.240 
even better guys this same setup looks
great<00:01:26.520> against<00:01:26.820> own<00:01:27.000> coverage

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
