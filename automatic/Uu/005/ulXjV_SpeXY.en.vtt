totally<00:01:31.500> different<00:01:32.570> but<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.780> importantly

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
totally different but more importantly

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.069 
totally different but more importantly
the<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.930> both

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the back as you can see here they both

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
the back as you can see here they both

do have the BlackBerry logo but this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
do have the BlackBerry logo but this
seems<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.619> little<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.220> rigid<00:01:41.520> for

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
seems to be a little bit more rigid for

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
seems to be a little bit more rigid for
the<00:01:42.420> z10<00:01:42.810> versus<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> q10<00:01:43.799> L<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.220> bit

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the z10 versus the q10 L is a little bit

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450
