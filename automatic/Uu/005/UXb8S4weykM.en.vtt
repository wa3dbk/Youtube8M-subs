00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
is another one of the species here at

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.230 
is another one of the species here at
the<00:00:22.050> FAU<00:00:22.289> Preserve<00:00:22.740> he's<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:23.970> on

animals<00:00:25.860> we<00:00:25.949> hope<00:00:26.099> we'd<00:00:26.250> come<00:00:26.400> across<00:00:26.430> tonight

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I bet you never knew that there was

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.170 
I bet you never knew that there was
actually<00:00:28.949> an<00:00:29.039> owl<00:00:29.220> species<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:29.849> burrowed

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
actually an owl species that burrowed

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.299 
actually an owl species that burrowed
underground<00:00:30.739> and<00:00:31.739> they<00:00:31.829> have<00:00:31.919> some<00:00:32.099> very

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
underground and they have some very

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.710 
underground and they have some very
distinct<00:00:32.879> features<00:00:33.269> they<00:00:33.449> have<00:00:33.570> these

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
distinct features they have these

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.500 
distinct features they have these
beautiful<00:00:34.019> big<00:00:34.890> yellow<00:00:35.250> eyes<00:00:35.460> black<00:00:36.059> centers

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
beautiful big yellow eyes black centers

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
beautiful big yellow eyes black centers
just<00:00:37.170> absolutely<00:00:37.830> beautiful<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.670> they've

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
just absolutely beautiful and they've

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.759 
just absolutely beautiful and they've
got<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.150> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> light<00:00:39.629> brown<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.320> white

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
got this kind of light brown and white

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.590 
got this kind of light brown and white
speckling<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> runs<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:42.000> down<00:00:42.210> their<00:00:42.420> back

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
speckling that runs all down their back

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.689 
speckling that runs all down their back
so<00:00:43.589> this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> time<00:00:44.220> of<00:00:44.339> night<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.460> these

so this is the time of night when these

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.160 
so this is the time of night when these
owls<00:00:44.879> come<00:00:45.150> out<00:00:45.269> and<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:45.809> feed

unlike most owls they hunt right at

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.969 
unlike most owls they hunt right at
sunset<00:00:48.210> instead<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.900> at<00:00:48.989> night<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.409> up<00:00:49.860> on
