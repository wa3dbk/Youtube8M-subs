the extra thirty or forty dollars now

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.259 
the extra thirty or forty dollars now
you're<00:02:57.829> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> start<00:02:58.340> realizing<00:02:59.150> that's

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
you're going to start realizing that's

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.670 
you're going to start realizing that's
going<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.569> start<00:02:59.720> taking<00:02:59.989> up<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.170> lot<00:03:00.200> more<00:03:00.620> of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
going to start taking up a lot more of

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.099 
going to start taking up a lot more of
your<00:03:00.890> time<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.359> whole<00:03:02.480> point<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.959> this

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
your time so the whole point of this

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.930 
your time so the whole point of this
whole<00:03:03.170> exercise<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.280> when<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:04.670> watch

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
these shows and we learning about ways

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
these shows and we learning about ways
of<00:03:06.739> saving<00:03:06.980> money<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.459> in<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.849> recession

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
world that we're living in finding ways

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.339 
world that we're living in finding ways
of<00:03:10.640> saving<00:03:10.819> money<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.209> very<00:03:11.390> important<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.230> in

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
figure out things that we can cut out

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.819 
figure out things that we can cut out
too<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:21.079> thing<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.590> need<00:03:21.799> to

some<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.599> these<00:03:23.720> cuts<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.290> try<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.250> know

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
some of these cuts and try to you know

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.460 
some of these cuts and try to you know
bend<00:03:26.030> things<00:03:26.239> around<00:03:26.599> a<00:03:26.810> little<00:03:26.840> bit<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:27.319> need
