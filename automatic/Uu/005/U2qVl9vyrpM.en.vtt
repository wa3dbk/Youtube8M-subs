least<00:02:09.769> you're<00:02:10.429> gonna<00:02:10.550> use<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> program<00:02:11.450> in

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
least you're gonna use a program in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.290 
least you're gonna use a program in
order<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.530> write<00:02:12.830> or<00:02:13.250> create<00:02:13.640> your<00:02:13.670> web<00:02:14.000> pages

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
order to write or create your web pages

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300 
order to write or create your web pages
and<00:02:14.630> then<00:02:15.170> you'll<00:02:15.319> use<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.530> web<00:02:15.830> browser<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and then you'll use a web browser to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180 
and then you'll use a web browser to
view<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:17.269> display<00:02:17.810> your<00:02:18.260> resulting<00:02:18.739> web<00:02:18.920> page

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
view and display your resulting web page

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.790 
view and display your resulting web page
and<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:20.030> often<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.690> go<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.319> forth

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and you often have to go back and forth

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.470 
and you often have to go back and forth
now<00:02:22.100> some<00:02:22.400> web<00:02:22.580> developers<00:02:23.090> might<00:02:23.299> use<00:02:23.450> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
now some web developers might use a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.809 
now some web developers might use a
program<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.110> kind<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.380> combines<00:02:24.830> these<00:02:25.519> two

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
program that kind of combines these two

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.940 
program that kind of combines these two
aspects<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.569> little<00:02:26.750> bit<00:02:26.870> more<00:02:27.019> seamlessly<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
aspects a little bit more seamlessly and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.160 
aspects a little bit more seamlessly and
I'm<00:02:28.190> talking<00:02:28.459> about<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.940> editors<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.750> let's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'm talking about the editors like let's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.220 
I'm talking about the editors like let's
say<00:02:30.290> Dreamweaver<00:02:30.860> or<00:02:31.160> something<00:02:31.549> where<00:02:32.230> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
say Dreamweaver or something where you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.199 
say Dreamweaver or something where you
can<00:02:33.410> kind<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.709> type<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.190> work<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.970> page

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
can kind of type and work in the page

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.819 
can kind of type and work in the page
and<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:35.780> it'll<00:02:35.989> also<00:02:36.110> give<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.530> preview

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
and then it'll also give you a preview

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.650 
and then it'll also give you a preview
in<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.450> same<00:02:38.780> program<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.400> let's<00:02:41.299> see

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
in that very same program so let's see

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.270 
in that very same program so let's see
what<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:41.900> what's<00:02:42.470> involved<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:42.950> making<00:02:43.070> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
what it's what's involved in making a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.039 
what it's what's involved in making a
change<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:43.850> let's<00:02:44.239> try<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.510> I'll<00:02:44.750> go<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
change so let's try this I'll go to the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.840 
change so let's try this I'll go to the
body<00:02:45.200> my<00:02:45.500> page<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.130> I'm<00:02:46.250> gonna<00:02:46.370> type<00:02:46.640> what's

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
body my page and I'm gonna type what's

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:57.099 
body my page and I'm gonna type what's
called<00:02:47.030> an<00:02:47.120> inline<00:02:47.480> style<00:02:55.359> that's<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.510> code<00:02:56.780> for

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
called an inline style that's a code for

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.830 
called an inline style that's a code for
dark<00:02:57.320> blue<00:02:57.650> or<00:02:57.980> medium<00:02:58.700> dark<00:02:58.850> blue<00:02:59.120> now<00:02:59.600> what

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
change to my code I'm pressing ctrl s to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.780 
change to my code I'm pressing ctrl s to
save<00:03:06.160> let's<00:03:07.160> do<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.430> again

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
and I head over to my browser and I'm

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.740 
and I head over to my browser and I'm
just<00:03:10.190> gonna<00:03:10.340> refresh<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.239> now<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
just gonna refresh and now the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.940 
just gonna refresh and now the
background<00:03:12.079> is<00:03:12.620> dark<00:03:13.070> blue<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.260> web

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
background is dark blue so this is web

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.360 
background is dark blue so this is web
development<00:03:16.400> it's<00:03:17.000> kind<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.920> having<00:03:18.920> an<00:03:19.010> idea

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
things inside of those tags and then in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.360 
things inside of those tags and then in
between<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.940> opening<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:18.190> closing<00:04:19.190> head

tags they have a lot more stuff in there
and<00:04:21.530> we're<00:04:21.620> gonna<00:04:21.680> work<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.160> some<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.460> that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
and we're gonna work on some of that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.130 
and we're gonna work on some of that
here's<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.960> title<00:04:25.300> for<00:04:26.300> Apple's<00:04:26.690> website

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
here's the title for Apple's website

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.350 
here's the title for Apple's website
just<00:04:27.620> like<00:04:27.770> my<00:04:27.950> page<00:04:28.250> also<00:04:28.520> had<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> title<00:04:29.650> so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
just like my page also had a title so

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.050 
just like my page also had a title so
bigger<00:04:32.360> more<00:04:32.930> complex<00:04:33.070> webpages<00:04:34.070> simply<00:04:34.880> have

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
bigger more complex webpages simply have

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.920 
bigger more complex webpages simply have
more<00:04:35.090> HTML<00:04:36.160> involved<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.340> their<00:04:37.520> creation<00:04:38.030> but

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
more HTML involved in their creation but

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.050 
more HTML involved in their creation but
all<00:04:39.080> web<00:04:39.290> pages<00:04:39.320> have<00:04:39.860> three<00:04:40.280> basic<00:04:40.550> things

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
all web pages have three basic things

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360 
all web pages have three basic things
you<00:04:41.390> know<00:04:41.510> they<00:04:41.630> have<00:04:41.780> text<00:04:42.470> images<00:04:43.070> and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
you know they have text images and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.930 
you know they have text images and
hyperlinks<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:44.920> bigger<00:04:45.920> sites<00:04:46.220> have<00:04:46.490> more<00:04:46.700> of

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
hyperlinks and bigger sites have more of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.570 
hyperlinks and bigger sites have more of
those<00:04:47.150> three<00:04:47.510> things<00:04:47.780> now<00:04:48.740> while<00:04:49.370> you're

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
those three things now while you're

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.150 
those three things now while you're
learning<00:04:49.790> HTML<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.990> ultimately<00:04:51.350> CSS<00:04:51.950> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
learning HTML and ultimately CSS and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.370 
learning HTML and ultimately CSS and
JavaScript<00:04:52.790> you're<00:04:53.270> going<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.780> understand

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
JavaScript you're going to understand

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.670 
JavaScript you're going to understand
what<00:04:54.620> all<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:55.010> these<00:04:55.190> tags<00:04:56.030> mean<00:04:56.810> you're<00:04:57.560> gonna

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
what all of these tags mean you're gonna

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.230 
what all of these tags mean you're gonna
become<00:04:57.920> very<00:04:58.100> familiar<00:04:58.730> with<00:04:58.760> them<00:04:59.000> because

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
become very familiar with them because

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.850 
become very familiar with them because
you'll<00:04:59.390> use<00:04:59.450> them<00:04:59.840> over<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.470> over<00:05:00.740> again

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
you'll use them over and over again

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.590 
you'll use them over and over again
while<00:05:01.490> you're<00:05:01.700> making<00:05:01.850> your<00:05:02.060> web<00:05:02.330> pages

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
while you're making your web pages

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.200 
while you're making your web pages
you'll<00:05:03.320> learn<00:05:03.650> pretty<00:05:03.950> quickly<00:05:04.310> that<00:05:04.640> this<00:05:04.880> li

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
you'll learn pretty quickly that this li

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.230 
you'll learn pretty quickly that this li
is<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> list<00:05:06.110> item<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:07.070> it's<00:05:07.220> used<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.550> create<00:05:07.940> a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
is a list item and it's used to create a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.710 
is a list item and it's used to create a
list<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.080> items<00:05:09.470> very<00:05:10.340> often<00:05:10.820> in<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.060> navigation

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
list of items very often in a navigation

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.540 
list of items very often in a navigation
menu<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:12.910> by<00:05:13.910> looking<00:05:14.240> at<00:05:14.540> this<00:05:15.250> we<00:05:16.250> see<00:05:16.520> that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
menu so by looking at this we see that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.900 
menu so by looking at this we see that
there<00:05:16.940> is<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.770> reference<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:18.919> Apple<00:05:19.370> there's

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
there is a a reference to Apple there's

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.850 
there is a a reference to Apple there's
a<00:05:20.000> reference<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.480> Mac<00:05:20.840> there's<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.470> reference

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
a reference to Mac there's a reference

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.570 
a reference to Mac there's a reference
to<00:05:21.980> iPod<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.940> iPhone<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.620> very<00:05:24.980> telltale

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
to iPod and iPhone this is very telltale

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.790 
to iPod and iPhone this is very telltale
to<00:05:25.790> how<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:25.970> website<00:05:26.540> might<00:05:26.810> make<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.050> navigation

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
to how a website might make a navigation

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.630 
to how a website might make a navigation
menu<00:05:27.910> Apple<00:05:28.910> Mac<00:05:29.360> iPod<00:05:30.140> iPhone<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:31.130> if<00:05:31.430> we<00:05:31.520> go

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
menu Apple Mac iPod iPhone and if we go

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.090 
menu Apple Mac iPod iPhone and if we go
back<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.850> Apple's<00:05:32.270> website<00:05:33.790> zoom<00:05:34.790> out<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:35.000> bit

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
back to Apple's website zoom out a bit

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.409 
back to Apple's website zoom out a bit
there<00:05:37.100> it<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.370> it's<00:05:38.000> Apple<00:05:38.660> Mac<00:05:39.140> iPod<00:05:39.950> iPhone

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
there it is it's Apple Mac iPod iPhone

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.320 
there it is it's Apple Mac iPod iPhone
so<00:05:41.419> this<00:05:42.290> part<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:43.010> their<00:05:43.190> webpage<00:05:43.790> was

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
so this part of their webpage was

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.580 
so this part of their webpage was
created<00:05:45.080> with<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:46.040> particular<00:05:46.520> section

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
created with that particular section

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.810 
created with that particular section
here<00:05:48.590> we<00:05:48.740> go<00:05:48.890> of<00:05:49.070> HTML<00:05:50.060> code

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
here we go of HTML code

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.850 
here we go of HTML code
there's<00:05:51.000> their<00:05:51.270> store<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:51.990> it's<00:05:52.140> Apple<00:05:52.530> store

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
there's their store so it's Apple store

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.390 
there's their store so it's Apple store
Mac<00:05:53.250> iPod<00:05:53.790> iPhone<00:05:54.000> so<00:05:54.930> it<00:05:55.680> doesn't<00:05:56.070> take<00:05:56.220> that

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
Mac iPod iPhone so it doesn't take that

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.450 
Mac iPod iPhone so it doesn't take that
tough<00:05:56.610> it's<00:05:57.180> not<00:05:57.390> that<00:05:57.810> tough<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.860> learn<00:05:59.100> how

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
tough it's not that tough to learn how

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.780 
tough it's not that tough to learn how
to<00:05:59.490> create<00:05:59.790> this<00:06:00.120> it's<00:06:00.690> writing<00:06:01.170> some<00:06:01.500> code

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
to create this it's writing some code

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.740 
to create this it's writing some code
styling<00:06:02.790> it<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.000> way<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.150> want<00:06:03.390> it<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.510> look

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
styling it the way you want it to look

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.930 
styling it the way you want it to look
and<00:06:03.990> then<00:06:04.050> you've<00:06:04.230> got<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.410> webpage<00:06:04.830> so<00:06:05.430> let's

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
and then you've got a webpage so let's

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.630 
and then you've got a webpage so let's
go<00:06:06.090> ahead<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.360> get<00:06:06.480> started
