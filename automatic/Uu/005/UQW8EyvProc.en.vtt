00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello my dear friends gardeners 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.179
 and gardeners today we'll talk 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.730
 about planting garlic 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.360
 now is the very moment 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.109
 when it can be planted good 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 harvest 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.930
 this first one never has to rush to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.080
 planting garlic and second 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 no need to delay the way then the numbers 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.670
 so if you congratulate on landing 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.940
 garlic like you usually like many 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.880
 reason I wait there for the first frost 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 and I will plant it wrong we 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.360
 must plant garlic with you at the end 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 September and the first week of October, the first 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.390
 2 weeks of October for what to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 garlic winters well 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.860
 and next year was a good harvest he 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 must definitely have time to take root 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.730
 many of you warm the garlic and say 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 I freeze him I assure you with him 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.430
 it just happens that he did not have time 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.240
 take root and so like me 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.080
 prepare the beds of garlic 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 me when garlic moscow 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.830
 my land was already well here 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 fertilized with manure 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.200
 but that's enough for garlic that is 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.230
 you can plant it after tomatoes after 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.150
 cucumbers here such cultures for which 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:41.210
 you more scrupulous look here 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.050
 carefully chopped ridge 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.090
 and here I am making your way 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.900
 look at the rain again she is something 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.290
 impaled 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 it's like a siderat I have sown here 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.800
 agnes of that for what for when i 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.500
 prepared the beds started to grow 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.830
 weeds do not need me so I 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.800
 I put them in the siderates in the spring I will remove them 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.180
 I'll show you how to do it now 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.030
 look carefully what i have to 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 do with this comb i take here like this 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.030
 fan and neatly tidy 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:26.440
 of this crest like so with mac 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.440
 we are doing this now 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.140
 it's all done very quickly pretty 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.460
 This garlic bed is very successful 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.360
 borrowed from caring for this bed 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:53.260
 so I recommend you plant a number 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:54.010
 just so here we have prepared with you 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.730
 garden bed 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 we are undermining it or and now we are with you 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.430
