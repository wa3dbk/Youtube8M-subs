00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
my best to crank out units early on

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.690 
my best to crank out units early on
because<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.739> said<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.980> don't<00:03:10.190> want<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.639> to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
because like I said I don't want this to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.990 
because like I said I don't want this to
go<00:03:10.880> on<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.650> on

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.030 

because<00:03:19.000> usually<00:03:19.209> I'm<00:03:19.690> an<00:03:19.840> economic<00:03:20.379> turtle<00:03:20.830> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
because usually I'm an economic turtle I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.690 
because usually I'm an economic turtle I
like<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.250> hide<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.569> base<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.530> then<00:03:23.709> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
like to hide up in my base and then just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.830 
like to hide up in my base and then just
explode<00:03:25.299> outwards<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.909> now<00:03:27.909> everything<00:03:28.720> is

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
explode outwards so now everything is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.990 
explode outwards so now everything is
moving<00:03:29.200> along<00:03:29.290> very<00:03:30.040> nicely<00:03:31.590> we've<00:03:32.590> got<00:03:33.000> our

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000
