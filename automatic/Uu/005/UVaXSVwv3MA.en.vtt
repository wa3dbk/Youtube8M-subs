00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 supreme magistrate said that at 10 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.880
 the morning was going to notify his ruling that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 it simply notifies it effectively 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.620
 there are audiences the decision he takes 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 he passes it and sends him table of parts is by 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.930
 written if a redirect is a fault 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.939
 of security I'm not what I could that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.970
 what could be decided and what would be 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 those possible failures good basically 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.010
 if we start the concept of the leadership 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.439
 and of discord and you have two options 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.140
 declares her innocent or declares that the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 nullity and a new trial either 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.870
 those options that you can take and could 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.420
 also ratify the previous sentence 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.239
 not good that has also been said to be 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.250
 possible in reality but when one says 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 we are in a discord means 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 that there are previous opinions and one should 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.809
 pronounce on that but there is no 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.610
 limit in the law the law the organic law 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.559
 with listening to them but I understand the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.480
 issue of discord let's almost say in 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.550
 football terms like a draw and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 that therefore I can as a judge 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.900
 decide to resolve for one side or for 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.120
 the other clear that would be more or less 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.670
 but when you tell me if you can touch 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.550
 a different solution to say it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 well but if I would not be inside the 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.640
 scheme of discord compel the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.620
 public what is it waiting for 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 because a few weeks ago it is not true 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.250
 I know if suddenly one month we saw bbva 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.070
 for like you also in front of a judge 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.710
 leader at the time was asked to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.230
 she was not the one in charge in the certain 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.720
 for a series of accusations and denunciations 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.510
 against him and what remains pending 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.270
 is that there were magistrates on the one hand that 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.430
 they said that she should be acquitted and others 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.070
 who said that a new one should be started 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 process and how there was a tie like 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.160
 he mentions federico effectively 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.500
 need another magistrate 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.970
 this new another magistrate because the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.690
 first judge could not do it I have to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.729
 say if it is absolved or if it is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.320
 you should start the process suddenly 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.210
 this third case let's say we're 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.260
 saying could you suddenly say no 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.790
 ratified the initial sentence but that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.500
 is let's say it would be quite 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.560
 strange and are you in any of the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 cases she would be released or not 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 good 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.570
 I think so 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 well, not only in any case 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.950
 in the event that they declare the nullity 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.630
 because if they declare absolution the law 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.500
 says you have to call a magistrate 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 more because because the supreme court only 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.720
 can make resolution with four votes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 and we would be 33 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.510
 we are 32 to 23 who say 3 what is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.030
 the new oral trial and 28 and this judge 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.620
 today says absolution we would be 333 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.270
 studies and had to wait for another 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 magistrate so that they decide through 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 appoint a new supreme judge with the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 purpose since he really decides the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 tiebreaker of the final tiebreaker and the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.330
 final tiebreaker and what do you expect 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 the good defense we have 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.459
 raised the acquittal on the basis of 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.860
 what exist we have never changed and 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.180
 we have asked for nothing alternative because 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.459
 we have found a series of elements 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.340
 and they also have to do with categories 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.650
 legal and probative 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.960
 were exposed on the day of the events and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.960
 for example 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.000
 how could you explain now that when 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.610
 they initiated the criminal imputation 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
 They said it was Miss Liliana 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.440
 Castro and her 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.450
 and that liliana castro was also the one 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.430
 promoted the clear then there there was 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.900
 material elements and in addition and there are 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 historical data because it is assumed that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.330
 are telling a behavior then the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.460
 no court says she is innocent and no 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.770
 mobile for profit I no longer talk to the 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.630
 hitman I contact him because like me 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.310
 they brought and then the new island 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 but then they would have to create a 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.640
 new clear factual scenario 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.300
 then there you want an old man 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.910
 Roman aphorism to the same facts the 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.370
 same right then that's been 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.050
 without reasonable explanation now in the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.850
 recent times we have also seen a 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.440
 change of attitude in n-va who now 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.350
 points out rather to his brother like that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.270
 could have something to do with the 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.100
 murder not because it says who was 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.810
 shelter in who was the one who opened the 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.970
 door etc. 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.970
 but already giving accusations let's say 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.400
 previously it did before the good hand 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.500
 to see actually she does certain 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.270
 questions for example there is a part 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.280
 final in the assassin's statement and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.450
 crazy is and because it has already been declared 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.640
 so for the supreme court 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.010
 that would not be the qt anymore where it says 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.720
 makes a small reference to who 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.810
 lost the keys 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.250
 and in the story that ariel himself 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.680
 he said that indeed there was 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.780
 lost the keys and when one tries 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.420
 you try to verify what it is that 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.510
 really to be able to enter that house 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.520
 It is insufficient to open the insurance because 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.070
 everyone has a sheet only with one 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.170
 key you could have entered if that is 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.110
 the approach that is said because no 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.170
 at the time this case was not investigated 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.760
 but then the hit man this one came in 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.070
 the walls as I once told you 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.930
 she always said in her statements 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.550
 that have entered through the park 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.170
 for the bet for having to take out is 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.420
 unclear and that's pretty understandable 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.070
 because when you go to the house you gave the 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.710
 opportunity to the house next door there is a 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.960
 nursery of San Isidro and there is a mesh one 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.160
 metal mesh where one can but 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 when they did the reconstruction I 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.270
 I remember that 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.419
 this alejandro ospina failed to demonstrate 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.789
 as he had climbed and could not convince 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.220
 to the exact authorities nor the 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.599
 efficiency of your income 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.270
 clear but the authorities have not 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.410
 could explain how it is possible that 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.750
 existed in the victim's room 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.990
 dry grass because it was next to a 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.140
 yard 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.270
 to say something is how can there be grass 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.370
 if a person has not entered from the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.770
 garden to the room then there is a 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.140
 series of questions that more the room and 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.990
 that must be recognized what the room said 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.240
 he recognized the room he condemned said that 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.000
 the police investigation had been 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.190
 negligent diligent and wants to say with 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.850
 a total lack of legal care 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.850
 expressed
