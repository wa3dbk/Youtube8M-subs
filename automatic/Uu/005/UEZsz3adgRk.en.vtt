okay<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> here's<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.290> quick<00:00:01.650> tip<00:00:01.680> from

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay guys here's a quick tip from

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.680 
okay guys here's a quick tip from
wrecking<00:00:02.460> dojo<00:00:03.350> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> cover<00:00:04.680> a

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
wrecking dojo we're going to cover a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.030 
wrecking dojo we're going to cover a
scenario<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.720> kind<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.109> came<00:00:07.319> up<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.799> an

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
scenario that kind of came up for an

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.259 
scenario that kind of came up for an
animator<00:00:08.809> on<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.870> tail<00:00:10.290> rig<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.700> one

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
animator on a tail rig so this is one

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
animator on a tail rig so this is one
quick<00:00:12.990> way<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.170> use<00:00:13.620> constraints<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
quick way to use constraints and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.220 
quick way to use constraints and
animation<00:00:14.700> layers<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.780> turn<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.619> badly<00:00:17.550> rigged

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
animation layers to turn a badly rigged

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.900 
animation layers to turn a badly rigged
spline<00:00:19.230> ik<00:00:19.850> into<00:00:21.439> an<00:00:22.439> FK<00:00:23.100> Rick<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.760> your

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
spline ik into an FK Rick for your

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.609 
spline ik into an FK Rick for your
animation<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> let's<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.670> started<00:00:27.560> okay<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
animation so let's get started okay so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
animation so let's get started okay so
let's<00:00:28.980> say<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.090> rig<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> were

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
let's say that this was the rig you were

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.299 
let's say that this was the rig you were
given<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.290> clusters<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
given and you just have clusters for the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.310 
given and you just have clusters for the
town

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
town

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.979 
town
so<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.820> course<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.420> animate<00:00:39.600> these

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so of course you can animate these

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.310 
so of course you can animate these
things<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.650> at<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> time<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:43.590> unpleasant

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
things one at a time and it's unpleasant

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.830 
things one at a time and it's unpleasant
because<00:00:46.320> they're<00:00:46.830> all<00:00:47.010> world<00:00:47.489> space<00:00:47.840> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
because they're all world space so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
because they're all world space so
here's<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.520> ahead<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> go

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
here's what we do we go ahead and go

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.700 
here's what we do we go ahead and go
through<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.910> constrain<00:00:53.910> each<00:00:54.269> cluster

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
through and constrain each cluster

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.090 
through and constrain each cluster
cluster<00:00:56.930> 2<00:00:57.930> we're<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> constrain<00:00:58.920> with

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
cluster 2 we're going to constrain with

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
cluster 2 we're going to constrain with
parent<00:00:59.489> constraint<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:01.129> default<00:01:02.129> options

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
parent constraint and default options

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.950 
parent constraint and default options
maintain<00:01:03.089> offset<00:01:03.480> head<00:01:03.660> apply<00:01:05.690> I'm<00:01:06.690> going<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
maintain offset head apply I'm going to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.880 
maintain offset head apply I'm going to
build<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> pretend<00:01:07.830> FK<00:01:08.340> higher<00:01:08.520> gear<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> grab

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
build a pretend FK higher gear so I grab

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.440 
build a pretend FK higher gear so I grab
cluster<00:01:11.640> 2<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.850> 3

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.960 

and<00:01:17.590> parent<00:01:18.590> constraint

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
and parent constraint

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
and parent constraint
okay<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:20.990> what<00:01:21.470> we<00:01:21.620> should<00:01:21.800> have<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:24.010> if<00:01:25.010> I

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
okay so now what we should have is if I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.950 
okay so now what we should have is if I
rotate<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.440> they<00:01:27.440> all<00:01:27.560> move<00:01:27.770> together<00:01:28.010> I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
rotate this they all move together I

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.710 
rotate this they all move together I
rotate<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.140> second<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:32.180> moves<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
rotate this second one it moves the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.720 
rotate this second one it moves the
second<00:01:33.170> one<00:01:33.260> but<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.890> problem<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.310> we've<00:01:34.700> got

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
second one but the problem is we've got

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.490 
second one but the problem is we've got
a<00:01:34.940> constraint<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.050> if<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.290> hit<00:01:36.440> a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
a constraint here so if we hit a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.780 
a constraint here so if we hit a
keyframe<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:37.070> going<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.280> turn<00:01:37.460> off<00:01:37.520> our

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
keyframe it's going to turn off our

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.920 
keyframe it's going to turn off our
constraints<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.730> simple<00:01:41.060> way<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.900> use

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
constraints so the simple way is to use

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.250 
constraints so the simple way is to use
the<00:01:42.080> animation<00:01:42.620> layers<00:01:43.480> so<00:01:44.480> I'm<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.080> go

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
the animation layers so I'm going to go

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.790 
the animation layers so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.620> select<00:01:45.800> all<00:01:46.580> three<00:01:46.940> nodes<00:01:47.800> all

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
ahead and select all three nodes all

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.590 
ahead and select all three nodes all
three<00:01:49.070> clusters<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.730> course<00:01:50.090> if<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.420> was

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
three clusters of course if this was

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.380 
three clusters of course if this was
your<00:01:50.720> own<00:01:50.840> tail<00:01:51.080> rig<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.500> could<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.830> your<00:01:51.950> own

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
your own tail rig this could be your own

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.410 
your own tail rig this could be your own
on<00:01:53.390> own<00:01:53.840> tail<00:01:54.550> controls<00:01:55.550> or<00:01:55.760> whatever<00:01:56.119> spline

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
on own tail controls or whatever spline

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.490 
on own tail controls or whatever spline
ik<00:01:57.070> only<00:01:58.070> rig<00:01:58.340> you've<00:01:58.580> got<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.290> I'm<00:02:00.290> just

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
ik only rig you've got and I'm just

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.200 
ik only rig you've got and I'm just
going<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.710> simply<00:02:00.920> assign<00:02:01.400> these<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.880> an

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
going to simply assign these to an

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.609 
going to simply assign these to an
animation<00:02:02.630> layer<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> default

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
animation layer this is a default

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.300 
animation layer this is a default
animation<00:02:06.619> layer<00:02:06.800> hope<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:08.690> pass<00:02:08.929> through

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
animation layer hope with pass through

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.080 
animation layer hope with pass through
nothing<00:02:10.310> special<00:02:10.729> not<00:02:11.150> override<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:13.940> this

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
nothing special not override so now this

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.870 
nothing special not override so now this
is<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.300> active<00:02:14.810> layer<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.459> if<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.610> go<00:02:16.760> ahead

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
is the active layer and if I go ahead

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.750 
is the active layer and if I go ahead
and<00:02:17.350> were<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.560> animate<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.540> cluster<00:02:20.930> I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
and were to animate this this cluster I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:37.690 
and were to animate this this cluster I
set<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> keyframe

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.090 

it's<00:02:38.270> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.660> animate

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.809 

over<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> top<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.800> constraints

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.970 

so<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.480> could<00:02:47.659> set<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> couple<00:02:48.079> keep<00:02:48.499> more

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
so I could set a couple keep more

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:58.059 
so I could set a couple keep more
keyframes<00:02:49.159> on<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.700> tail

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.979 

okay<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.150> now<00:02:59.299> we<00:02:59.359> have<00:02:59.480> our<00:03:01.299> previous<00:03:02.299> ik<00:03:02.599> only

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
okay so now we have our previous ik only

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.709 
okay so now we have our previous ik only
rig<00:03:03.200> working<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.219> a<00:03:04.700> FK<00:03:05.269> rig<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:07.269> being<00:03:08.269> able

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
rig working as a FK rig and being able

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.940 
rig working as a FK rig and being able
to<00:03:09.049> be<00:03:09.499> animated<00:03:10.040> correctly<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:12.349> now<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.680> can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
to be animated correctly and now you can

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.869 
to be animated correctly and now you can
just<00:03:13.129> go<00:03:13.249> ahead<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.489> use<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:16.609> bake

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
just go ahead and use the bake

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.030 
just go ahead and use the bake
simulation<00:03:17.510> tool<00:03:19.659> when<00:03:20.659> you're<00:03:20.780> ready<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.200> to

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
simulation tool when you're ready to to

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.849 
simulation tool when you're ready to to
get<00:03:22.340> rid<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.819> constraints<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.870> go<00:03:24.709> back

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
get rid of the constraints and go back

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.259 
get rid of the constraints and go back
to<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.129> ik<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.609> rig<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.909> can<00:03:26.090> bake

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
to the ik on the rig you can bake

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.699 
to the ik on the rig you can bake
animation<00:03:26.810> down<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> new<00:03:27.439> layer<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.840> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
animation down to a new layer and you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.759 
animation down to a new layer and you
can<00:03:30.919> you're<00:03:31.790> good<00:03:31.969> to<00:03:32.060> go<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:35.239> that's<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.199> it's

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
can you're good to go and that's it it's

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.539 
can you're good to go and that's it it's
pretty<00:03:36.919> simple<00:03:37.219> but<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:39.319> know<00:03:39.549> hopefully

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
pretty simple but you know hopefully

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.490 
pretty simple but you know hopefully
your<00:03:41.449> character<00:03:42.199> TDS<00:03:42.530> won't<00:03:42.799> just<00:03:43.129> give<00:03:43.310> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
your character TDS won't just give you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.369 
your character TDS won't just give you
you<00:03:45.500> know<00:03:45.530> world<00:03:45.919> space<00:03:46.689> tale<00:03:47.689> rig<00:03:47.930> controls

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
you know world space tale rig controls

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.509 
you know world space tale rig controls
that<00:03:48.680> are<00:03:49.419> unable<00:03:50.419> to<00:03:50.449> do<00:03:50.900> dynamic<00:03:51.519> hardy

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
that are unable to do dynamic hardy

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.479 
that are unable to do dynamic hardy
switching<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.500> that's<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:54.949> use<00:03:55.250> your

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
switching so that's it use your

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.209 
switching so that's it use your
animation<00:03:56.239> layers<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.530> conjunction<00:03:58.069> with

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
animation layers in conjunction with

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.259 
animation layers in conjunction with
your<00:03:58.900> constraints<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.129> it<00:04:01.129> creates<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.760> very

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
your constraints and it creates a very

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.860 
your constraints and it creates a very
flexible<00:04:02.540> powerful<00:04:03.349> rig

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.380 

and<00:04:10.379> hopefully<00:04:10.700> it'll<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.909> you<00:04:12.000> out<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.150> other

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and hopefully it'll get you out of other

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.780 
and hopefully it'll get you out of other
situations<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.739> cause<00:04:13.950> problems<00:04:14.310> on

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
situations that can cause problems on

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.780 
situations that can cause problems on
your<00:04:14.970> your<00:04:15.420> rig<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:17.449> I<00:04:18.449> hope<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:19.519> gives<00:04:20.519> some

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
your your rig and I hope that gives some

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.610 
your your rig and I hope that gives some
people<00:04:21.090> some<00:04:21.239> ideas<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.780> how<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.199> use<00:04:22.410> these

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
people some ideas on how to use these

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.750 
people some ideas on how to use these
together<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> great<00:04:24.630> day
