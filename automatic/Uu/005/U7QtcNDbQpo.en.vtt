that are coming out of the cows and it

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.490 
that are coming out of the cows and it
was<00:01:18.160> literally<00:01:18.460> for<00:01:18.970> odor<00:01:19.390> control<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.200> that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
was literally for odor control and that

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.990 
was literally for odor control and that
thing<00:01:20.740> would<00:01:20.890> blow<00:01:21.040> up<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.550> we'd<00:01:21.670> have<00:01:21.850> to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
thing would blow up and we'd have to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.490 
thing would blow up and we'd have to
suck<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> gas<00:01:22.540> out<00:01:22.810> from<00:01:23.050> underneath<00:01:23.259> and

suck the gas out from underneath and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.900 
suck the gas out from underneath and
flare<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:23.979> that's<00:01:24.130> what<00:01:24.340> got<00:01:24.490> us<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.670> thinking

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
flare and that's what got us to thinking

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.420 
flare and that's what got us to thinking
about<00:01:25.270> how<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:25.960> use<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.229> energy<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.340> he

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
about how can we use that energy so he

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.100 
about how can we use that energy so he
decided<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.970> install<00:01:28.360> what<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.660> called<00:01:28.930> an

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
decided to install what is called an

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.160 
decided to install what is called an
anaerobic<00:01:29.619> digester<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:31.180> tank<00:01:31.570> holds<00:01:32.050> a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
million gallons of cow manure inside it

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.320 
million gallons of cow manure inside it
is<00:01:35.560> broken<00:01:35.979> down<00:01:36.160> by<00:01:36.430> millions<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.300> millions

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
is broken down by millions and millions

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.380 
is broken down by millions and millions
of<00:01:37.930> microorganisms<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.210> digester<00:01:40.210> can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
of microorganisms that digester can

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.790 
of microorganisms that digester can
create<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.840> equivalent<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.410> hundred
