00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
season is that's why I think it's also

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
season is that's why I think it's also
part<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.130> surprising<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:29.790> good<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.150> got

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

fell over the over the offseason my jump

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.560 
fell over the over the offseason my jump
shot<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:33.030> Dr<00:01:33.890> getting<00:01:34.890> good<00:01:35.150> condo<00:01:36.150> gulak

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
shot my Dr getting good condo gulak

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
shot my Dr getting good condo gulak
about<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> surgeon<00:01:37.320> well<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.220> much

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
about with the surgeon well not so much

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
about with the surgeon well not so much
now<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.990> thing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
now I'm just because you know one thing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
now I'm just because you know one thing
is<00:01:40.320> he's<00:01:40.560> had<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> jump<00:01:41.159> shot<00:01:41.220> even<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is he's had that jump shot even the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
is he's had that jump shot even the
mid-range<00:01:42.390> shot<00:01:42.659> since<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> past<00:01:43.649> few<00:01:43.920> years

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
mid-range shot since the past few years

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.679 
mid-range shot since the past few years
and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> connected

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and then I think it's connected

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
and then I think it's connected
definitely<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.320> kevin<00:01:46.619> durant<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
definitely with kevin durant and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550

difference<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:17.310> have<00:05:17.580> Perkins<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:19.080> match<00:05:19.260> up

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
difference you have Perkins to match up

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.980
