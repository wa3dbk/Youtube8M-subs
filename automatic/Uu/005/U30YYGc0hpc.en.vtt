b-boys do this move but the whole thing

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.250 
b-boys do this move but the whole thing
is<00:00:27.460> just<00:00:28.000> because<00:00:28.359> this<00:00:28.630> is<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.930> YouTube

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
elevation the evolution of taking the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.979 
elevation the evolution of taking the
one<00:00:50.350> move<00:00:50.589> then<00:00:51.309> taking<00:00:51.729> someone<00:00:52.059> someone

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
one move then taking someone someone

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.719 
one move then taking someone someone
flipping<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.530> move<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:53.920> then<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.280> flip<00:00:54.549> in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
flipping that move and then you flip in

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.280 
flipping that move and then you flip in
that<00:00:54.909> move<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.690> move<00:00:55.869> that<00:00:56.019> I'm<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.260> to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
that move the move that I'm going to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.660 
that move the move that I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:56.470> originally<00:00:57.460> came<00:00:57.610> from

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
demonstrate originally came from

Mauricio the next one who flipped what

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.399 
Mauricio the next one who flipped what
he<00:01:01.269> calls<00:01:01.479> knee<00:01:01.629> chicken<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.110> let<00:01:02.199> me<00:01:02.290> show

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
now is part of a foundation forward

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.700 
now is part of a foundation forward
foundation<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:22.510> this<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:22.780> how<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:22.960> flipped<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.530> I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
foundation so this is how I flipped it I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.370 
foundation so this is how I flipped it I
took<00:01:24.100> different<00:01:24.790> elements<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:26.200> way<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
took different elements and the way you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.590 
took different elements and the way you
want<00:01:26.620> flip<00:01:26.830> things<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.190> like<00:01:27.370> okay<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:28.360> see

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
want flip things is like okay you see

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.170 
want flip things is like okay you see
the<00:01:28.780> inspiration<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.860> movement<00:01:30.250> then<00:01:31.030> you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
the inspiration of the movement then you

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.149 
the inspiration of the movement then you
want<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.390> take<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.600> elements<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.260> see<00:01:32.560> go

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
want to take the elements and see go

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.860 
want to take the elements and see go
through<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.430> process<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.880> can<00:01:34.480> I<00:01:34.540> do<00:01:34.600> that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
through the process of can I do that

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.810 
through the process of can I do that
with<00:01:34.990> two<00:01:35.170> hands<00:01:35.620> can't<00:01:36.250> do<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.460> with<00:01:36.610> one

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
with two hands can't do that with one

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.760 
with two hands can't do that with one
hand<00:01:36.850> can't<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:37.930> out<00:01:38.050> my<00:01:38.170> shoulder<00:01:38.409> or

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
hand can't do out my shoulder or

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.470 
hand can't do out my shoulder or
something<00:01:39.040> like<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.280> just<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.640> flip<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.450> I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
something like that just to flip it so I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.800 
something like that just to flip it so I
did<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.930> added<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:42.040> dimension<00:01:42.730> of<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.360> both

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
did is I added a dimension of going both

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.640 
did is I added a dimension of going both
directions<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.650> adding<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.370> CC<00:01:45.730> so<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.210> call<00:01:46.650> his

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
directions and adding a CC so I call his

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.899 
directions and adding a CC so I call his
movement<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:49.090> next<00:01:49.420> one's<00:01:49.630> next<00:01:50.110> one<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.909> start

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
movement the next one's next one I start

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.600 
movement the next one's next one I start
out<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.210> position<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:53.159> basically<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.460> do

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
out on this position and basically I do

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.660 
out on this position and basically I do
the<00:01:55.060> knee<00:01:55.180> check<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.440> go<00:01:56.650> right<00:01:57.040> this<00:01:57.250> time<00:01:57.490> I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
the knee check so I go right this time I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
the knee check so I go right this time I
pull<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:59.020> here<00:01:59.260> boom<00:01:59.979> boom<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.210> go<00:02:02.020> out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pull it in I go here boom boom I go out

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.820 
pull it in I go here boom boom I go out
better<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.970> see<00:02:04.210> see<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.320> I'm<00:02:05.409> using<00:02:05.590> both

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
better then I see see so I'm using both

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
I'm back in the beginning so that's how

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.470 
I'm back in the beginning so that's how
I<00:02:16.090> flipped<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.680> real<00:02:17.680> time<00:02:22.409> alright<00:02:23.409> so<00:02:23.680> here

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
I flipped it real time alright so here

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
I flipped it real time alright so here
it<00:02:25.480> goes

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.129 

notice<00:02:30.400> how<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:31.209> movement<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.689> still<00:02:31.959> in

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
notice how the movement is still in

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.720 
notice how the movement is still in
there<00:02:32.349> but<00:02:32.590> what<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> did<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.219> added<00:02:33.459> us

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
there but what I did is added us

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.420 
there but what I did is added us
dimension<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.780> CC<00:02:35.439> or<00:02:35.650> Russian<00:02:35.950> tap<00:02:36.159> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
dimension of a CC or Russian tap and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.509 
dimension of a CC or Russian tap and
using<00:02:36.939> both<00:02:37.090> hands<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.139> my<00:02:38.439> concept<00:02:38.709> was<00:02:38.950> how

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
using both hands so my concept was how

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.099 
using both hands so my concept was how
do<00:02:39.579> I<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.030> because<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:40.959> original

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
do I do this because the original

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.440 
do I do this because the original
concept<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.709> using<00:02:42.099> no<00:02:42.219> hands<00:02:42.639> how<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.389> use

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
concept was using no hands how do I use

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140 
concept was using no hands how do I use
my<00:02:43.719> hands<00:02:44.139> so<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:44.799> just<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.250> way<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.849> like

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
my hands so that's just a way to like

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.349 
my hands so that's just a way to like
take<00:02:46.689> moves<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.290> flip<00:02:47.889> it<00:02:47.919> did<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.849> mean<00:02:49.060> so

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
take moves and flip it did I mean so

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.479 
take moves and flip it did I mean so
that<00:02:49.510> way<00:02:49.599> it's<00:02:49.720> not<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.139> okay<00:02:50.799> I'm<00:02:51.159> going<00:02:51.400> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
that way it's not just okay I'm going to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.789 
that way it's not just okay I'm going to
look<00:02:51.669> at<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.909> move<00:02:52.090> move<00:02:52.810> remove<00:02:53.109> and<00:02:53.319> do<00:02:53.680> it

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
look at the move move remove and do it

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.369 
look at the move move remove and do it
exactly<00:02:53.889> the<00:02:54.250> same<00:02:54.459> which<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.209> also<00:02:55.599> okay<00:02:56.079> but

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
exactly the same which is also okay but

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.550 
exactly the same which is also okay but
then<00:02:56.980> how<00:02:57.280> would<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.519> make<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.909> your<00:02:58.090> own

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
then how would you make it your own

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.899 
then how would you make it your own
dinner<00:02:59.560> dinner<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.189> that<00:03:00.219> what<00:03:00.430> I'm<00:03:00.489> saying<00:03:00.669> so

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
dinner dinner is that what I'm saying so

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.099 
dinner dinner is that what I'm saying so
that's<00:03:01.030> what<00:03:01.239> we're<00:03:01.389> trying<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.659> think<00:03:01.810> that's

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
that's what we're trying to think that's

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.020 
that's what we're trying to think that's
the<00:03:02.260> concept<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.829> video<00:03:03.129> it's<00:03:03.669> not<00:03:03.730> just

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the concept of this video it's not just

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.849 
the concept of this video it's not just
to<00:03:04.150> learn<00:03:04.269> my<00:03:04.480> move<00:03:04.689> or<00:03:05.079> learn<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.590> SEOs

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
to learn my move or learn more it SEOs

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.800 
to learn my move or learn more it SEOs
move<00:03:06.099> by<00:03:06.459> how<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.760> could<00:03:07.209> teach<00:03:07.389> yourself<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
move by how you could teach yourself to

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:24.390 
move by how you could teach yourself to
make<00:03:08.139> it<00:03:08.290> different<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:23.769> these<00:03:23.979> are<00:03:24.159> some
