00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.240
 for how good for more the event is a pleasure to say hello we are a little 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.930
 football and we quickly get into history on Saturday on Saturday by the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.299
 night in reaching elective positions to defender Velasquez accompany the 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.070
 study had flown more we also found two situations left by 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.440
 play the version 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.810
 good afternoon guillermo love was to walk to the start of the game a little to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020
 the reality of the first time this changed the definitive course of play 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.500
 I think 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 as far as the show is concerned, because it fails 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.829
 three minute 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.530
 point of mouth as it is said to acclaim the auction so that it results little pantry 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.360
 I was forgiving and then the rival as is everything more fully back 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:42.339
 It was difficult to open few opportunities for what we already commented out there never 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.070
 you know he despaired because it was the most important thing of the team achieved but without 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.750
 stingy football on the part of the visitor and this will be all the toyos that 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.960
 tempted to dry 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.580
 Obviously the government if nothing likins embroidered 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680
 he knew the end deflated 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.510
 gorosito of a crossword that showed to the scorpions of durango and after 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.280
 a triumph deserved by how 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 they searched for others everywhere 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.110
 I share with the opinion, basically, you say because everyone 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.650
 we saw 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.940
 it was what happened in the durango team in which they bet at last not no 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 a lot of idea 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.140
 very much trying to cut mourning trying to cut and avoid cutting the plays 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 nothing else of the team grades all ball to golden half court have recovered 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.210
 90% of each punt of the opposing team's goalkeeper by purchasing later 2 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.210
 but this was the most obvious of Adriano tomás 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 who made a couple of mistakes but this was the one that scored the most and was about 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.490
 of costarle adored seem are up the marker urango ch the field of the ce 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 Definitive allergies entry entry because it was closed 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.119
 difficult to enter 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.179
 the team of mid-range durango scorpions was trying to lucas silva la 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.240
 depth that he had by harassment to the right the moment his voice fernandez 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.200
 at the first 45 minutes has cut and this silly move you have me so much that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 see the ejecting by durango when he nailed the tacos 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.400
 Caesar Morales to the forward the team rolled expressly percent by Carlos 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.740
 stolen threw a little more back to marino ledesma detroit and chicago 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 fernandez the moment that is the repetition of the play I think all 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.799
 percent figured that if it was that way 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.420
 2 defensively if it's not very clear how 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.750
 Mallorcan wants to cause damage to the player and because he has many others 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.020
 still missing from jumping has to do with his legs he saw with the body but that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.530
 it was clear where you live less it hurts him - he and he is tenth with everything 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.969
 the comfort 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.369
 to be the play of the team durango and yesterday a little bit of clarity leaves the 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.699
 I spot the minute 22 of the complementary part 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.939
 And what this was one of the six of the situation is normal that we're going to 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.369
 see alonso ramírez has an extraordinary talent match 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.069
 this is when I was already paying little stronger than the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.329
 the goal of 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.169
 she illuminated the visiting goalkeeper this very good play great shot a 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.380
 golazo defenses to morals the contrarremate the defense was closing 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.589
 then again the defense was going down 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.589
 delivering all the team of the defensively rose 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.569
 risk the physical as we can appreciate and distribution is 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.039
 they detached I attend the game some time well after the expulsion 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.709
 the disorder that created the expulsion others who did not take advantage of it 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.739
 even golden ones having to take the ball shame 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.890
 in fact the second one is that it gave them peace of mind because out there at the end 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.889
 by certain flavor throwing pelotazos to the goal of d of golds the equipment 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.919
 white but I hope that my current 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.109
 florencio ramírez excellent pass 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.569
 picasa danger 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.179
 when what the three points to the team with a general job of toronto 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.299
 the group the testaments after highlighting that he 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.269
 the team runs well inite 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.269
 because it is well directed that Mr. hugo fernández 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.409
 after match 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.519
 it is known is something that is playing and families and businesses 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.009
 outside the play is remarkable the play that the definition does not know casal 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.470
 pere a decent type definition will pass to 4 fontanet the aria 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.460
 how well the goalkeeper lets run also evaluated great move removed 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.130
 something dense ramirez and thus of first intention before the exit of the goal 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.990
 ended the play for whom one by zero that the final dessert was lifted 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.010
 in the meeting I think that for something if not until there until annotation was not 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.499
 bad but after the goal 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.479
 I think he reported that the soruco world had to kill the rival because 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.709
 durango I already spoke that to others 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.180
 I had to go out in search of this rival frame 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.300
 out there I think they were from a gift to be 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.310
 lost two points that the team had remained the same as in the 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.689
 first 45 minutes was until the 28th minute before the vote 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.659
 I think now it was found more the annotations actually of the day at 1 +0 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.659
 1% to show that we can but that there is a relaxation 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.840
 the street overeem strange situations as trustworthy 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.569
 min 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.030
 I do not think there's a fatigue here I do not know if we'll see if I can say it but I 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.909
 I think not 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.599
 the fact that the long balls were for some time 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.810
 that suddenly must solve a defense in which they attend is a mutation here 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.820
 is again part of pinto that will be encouraged to shoot at goal twelve 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.860
 companions 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.440
 to receive their center but they have not preferred it is for the ball goes by a 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.740
 side of the cabin from the hut of urbina we will repeat another 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.900
 the good arrivals of the team of the accomplished ones that on that side insisted 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.810
 a lot I read a transmission on the right much insisted and for 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.319
 left by the bald one and in few times they wanted and over there it seems to me that this 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.300
 boy can see from the most salvageable the party again I paint 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.099
 I have had a great participation 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.380
 here mark other 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.370
 and he said it to the dish with smell he did not play comet lucas and the mercy almost a golazo 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.760
 double by changing the profile already on what was the final stretch of the third game 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.200
 and do not doubt because the suit being the game and when we give is because eta but 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.360
 good if it will be good I do not know why 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.870
 you need to get the goal for such a task as practically all the weight 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.699
 lost this man was very pleased the depth of his guy that caracolea that 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.590
 he knows how to play outside the area he enters that he has great speed and I think that 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.590
 difference for the team achieved if europe lived the lawrence pavilion 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.440
 of change and it did not quite good moral drivers and that 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:11.059
 that gave him that part of dynamism that he occupied so moral lawyers 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:12.569
 as podium was given 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.969
 they gave me change my face a bit to the team and those present in their 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.149
 bush solution is important and another very important thing to note hugo 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:22.449
 Fernandez during the preseason always 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.260
 I always talk about that the cnt is styled navas important another that has 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.930
 most important in the chin that has many modifications of the saab nones 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.139
 moshe was to start another fire not before there prendo left mario padilla 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.089
 navantía was sit ledesma and can get to moral start 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.110
