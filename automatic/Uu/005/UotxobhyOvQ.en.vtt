addition to these four major brands we
also<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.160> homemade<00:00:17.550> potting<00:00:18.029> soil<00:00:18.300> which

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
also have my homemade potting soil which

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
also have my homemade potting soil which
I<00:00:19.170> will<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.500> comparing<00:00:20.100> against<00:00:20.520> these<00:00:20.670> other

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I will be comparing against these other

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.300 
I will be comparing against these other
store-bought<00:00:21.480> brands<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.590> stuff<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.039> mix

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
store-bought brands this stuff I mix

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.269 
store-bought brands this stuff I mix
myself<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.560> most<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.130> my

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
myself and I use it for most of my

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.240 
myself and I use it for most of my
outdoor<00:00:26.640> plants<00:00:27.180> will<00:00:27.900> also<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.289> testing<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
outdoor plants will also be testing just

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.080 
outdoor plants will also be testing just
straight<00:00:29.609> 100%<00:00:30.570> pure<00:00:30.840> compost<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.890> never<00:00:32.759> grow

straight 100% pure compost I never grow

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
straight 100% pure compost I never grow
in<00:00:33.239> straight<00:00:33.540> compost<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.620> curious<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
in straight compost so I was curious to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.119 
in straight compost so I was curious to
see<00:00:35.219> how<00:00:35.809> how<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> stacks<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> others

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
see how how this stacks up to the others

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.970 
see how how this stacks up to the others
now<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> started<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
now as you can see I started the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.119 
now as you can see I started the
experiment<00:00:41.460> already<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> red<00:00:43.739> Ruben

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
experiment already with the red Ruben

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.170 
experiment already with the red Ruben

stuff<00:05:35.550> that<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:35.820> use<00:05:36.090> for<00:05:36.330> all<00:05:36.419> my<00:05:36.450> outdoor

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
stuff that I use for all my outdoor

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.900 
stuff that I use for all my outdoor
plants<00:05:37.229> so<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.530> really<00:05:37.919> am<00:05:38.130> interested<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.639> see

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
plants so I really am interested to see

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.190 
plants so I really am interested to see
how<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.150> stacks<00:05:39.450> up<00:05:39.690> to<00:05:39.900> store-bought

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
how it stacks up to store-bought

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.920 
how it stacks up to store-bought
varieties<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.990> let's<00:05:43.860> see<00:05:44.039> I<00:05:44.070> planted<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.970> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
varieties so let's see I planted the the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.279 
varieties so let's see I planted the the
beans<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.950> basil<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:47.669> 714<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:48.960> it's<00:05:49.110> been

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
beans and the basil on 714 so it's been

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.230 
beans and the basil on 714 so it's been
about<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.530> week<00:05:49.650> since<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.490> start<00:05:51.030> of<00:05:51.120> the

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
about a week since the start of the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.350 
about a week since the start of the
experiment<00:05:52.130> there's<00:05:53.130> no<00:05:53.400> differences<00:05:54.090> yet

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
experiment there's no differences yet

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.250 
experiment there's no differences yet
between<00:05:54.660> any<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.139> these<00:05:55.349> plants<00:05:55.970> I<00:05:57.260> should

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
between any of these plants I should

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.080 
between any of these plants I should
have<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.710> tomatoes<00:05:59.160> planted<00:05:59.669> in<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.910> big

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
have the tomatoes planted in the big

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.800 
have the tomatoes planted in the big
pots<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.810> about<00:06:01.430> I'd<00:06:02.430> say<00:06:02.669> maybe<00:06:03.330> three<00:06:03.660> days

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
pots and about I'd say maybe three days

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.860 
pots and about I'd say maybe three days
or<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.530> took<00:06:05.250> cuttings<00:06:05.880> of<00:06:06.090> tomatoes<00:06:06.630> to

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
or so I took cuttings of tomatoes to

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.689 
or so I took cuttings of tomatoes to
keep<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.229> experiment<00:06:07.889> as<00:06:08.039> accurate<00:06:08.550> as

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
keep this experiment as accurate as

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.290 
keep this experiment as accurate as
possible

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
possible

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.230 
possible
so<00:06:10.080> I'll<00:06:10.860> be<00:06:11.220> putting<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.639> clones<00:06:11.910> of<00:06:12.090> the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
so I'll be putting the clones of the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.529 
so I'll be putting the clones of the
tomato<00:06:12.539> plants<00:06:12.960> in<00:06:13.080> shortly<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:15.030> big<00:06:15.240> pots

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
tomato plants in shortly the big pots

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.680 
tomato plants in shortly the big pots
here<00:06:15.870> are<00:06:15.990> 8<00:06:16.169> gallons<00:06:16.740> these<00:06:17.250> are<00:06:17.580> they<00:06:18.539> look

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
here are 8 gallons these are they look

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.089 
here are 8 gallons these are they look
about<00:06:18.810> four<00:06:19.289> and<00:06:19.560> these<00:06:19.680> are<00:06:19.860> five<00:06:21.830> so<00:06:22.830> anyway

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
about four and these are five so anyway

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.279 
about four and these are five so anyway
I<00:06:23.130> just<00:06:23.220> wanted<00:06:23.639> to<00:06:23.729> start<00:06:24.690> this<00:06:24.870> experiment

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
I just wanted to start this experiment

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.529 
I just wanted to start this experiment
off<00:06:25.620> with<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:25.979> first<00:06:26.190> video<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:26.849> stay<00:06:27.270> tuned

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
off with the first video so stay tuned

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.550 
off with the first video so stay tuned
