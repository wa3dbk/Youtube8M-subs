00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.990 

so<00:06:12.400> now<00:06:12.610> we<00:06:12.670> try<00:06:12.910> to<00:06:13.380> start<00:06:14.430> here<00:06:15.430> on<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.610> test

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
so now we try to start here on the test

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.740 
so now we try to start here on the test
ground<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.480> a<00:06:16.510> BMW<00:06:17.140> x6m<00:06:18.300> hillclimb<00:06:19.300> from<00:06:19.660> a

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
ground with a BMW x6m hillclimb from a

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.050 
ground with a BMW x6m hillclimb from a
complete<00:06:20.110> stop<00:06:20.350> Gaelic<00:06:20.770> acceleration<00:06:21.550> this

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
complete stop Gaelic acceleration this

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.410 
complete stop Gaelic acceleration this
one<00:06:22.330> this<00:06:22.600> hill<00:06:22.870> has<00:06:23.110> about<00:06:23.410> 25<00:06:24.300> tqez<00:06:26.400> 25%

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
one this hill has about 25 tqez 25%

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.450 
one this hill has about 25 tqez 25%
inclination<00:06:28.420> so<00:06:29.410> we<00:06:29.620> come<00:06:29.890> to<00:06:30.070> a<00:06:30.100> complete

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
inclination so we come to a complete

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.960 
inclination so we come to a complete
stop

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
stop

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.960 
stop
so<00:06:31.810> we<00:06:31.960> have<00:06:32.080> two<00:06:32.260> right<00:06:32.470> tires<00:06:33.100> on<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.580> slippery

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
so we have two right tires on a slippery

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.820 
so we have two right tires on a slippery
surface<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.750> left<00:06:34.960> tires<00:06:35.230> on<00:06:35.560> asphalt

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
surface and the left tires on asphalt

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.250 
surface and the left tires on asphalt
normal<00:06:36.610> asphalt<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:37.600> now<00:06:37.810> we<00:06:37.870> try<00:06:38.140> to

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
normal asphalt and now we try to

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.000 
normal asphalt and now we try to
accelerate<00:06:38.800> without<00:06:39.480> having<00:06:40.480> a<00:06:40.600> reverse

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
accelerate without having a reverse

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.510 
accelerate without having a reverse
movement<00:06:42.010> so<00:06:42.850> now<00:06:43.150> start<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:45.040> system

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
movement so now start and the system

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.210 
movement so now start and the system
really<00:06:45.820> tries<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.360> shift<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.810> right<00:06:46.990> power<00:06:47.980> on

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
really tries to shift the right power on

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.680 
really tries to shift the right power on
the<00:06:48.340> car<00:06:48.580> who<00:06:48.910> can<00:06:49.150> really<00:06:49.950> accelerate<00:06:50.950> and

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
the car who can really accelerate and

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.220 
the car who can really accelerate and
now<00:06:52.690> we<00:06:52.750> on<00:06:52.990> top<00:06:53.260> of<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.590> hill<00:06:53.770> and<00:06:54.780> no<00:06:55.780> problem

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
now we on top of the hill and no problem

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.180 
now we on top of the hill and no problem
the<00:06:56.410> customer<00:06:56.950> can<00:06:57.180> go<00:06:58.180> forward<00:06:58.990> or<00:06:59.500> after

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
the customer can go forward or after

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.030 
the customer can go forward or after
complete<00:07:00.550> stop<00:07:00.880> without<00:07:01.540> any<00:07:01.810> reversing<00:07:02.530> so

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
complete stop without any reversing so

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.840 
complete stop without any reversing so
it<00:07:03.670> was<00:07:03.820> very<00:07:04.030> nice<00:07:04.290> we<00:07:05.290> always<00:07:05.650> try<00:07:05.860> to<00:07:05.890> drive

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
it was very nice we always try to drive

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.620 
it was very nice we always try to drive
like<00:07:07.090> customers<00:07:07.690> so<00:07:07.930> we<00:07:08.080> really<00:07:08.740> try<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.630> drive

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
like customers so we really try to drive

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.150 
like customers so we really try to drive
in<00:07:10.810> this<00:07:10.930> condition<00:07:11.110> like<00:07:11.530> understeering

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
in this condition like understeering

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.370 
in this condition like understeering
over<00:07:12.520> steering<00:07:12.820> how<00:07:13.060> the<00:07:13.120> system's<00:07:13.870> perform

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
over steering how the system's perform

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.180 
over steering how the system's perform
and<00:07:14.650> says<00:07:15.150> rustici<00:07:16.150> DTC<00:07:16.750> and<00:07:16.990> also<00:07:17.710> like

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
and says rustici DTC and also like

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.310 
and says rustici DTC and also like
steering<00:07:18.580> suspension<00:07:19.470> and<00:07:20.470> also<00:07:21.010> the<00:07:22.320> braking

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
steering suspension and also the braking

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.580 
steering suspension and also the braking
system<00:07:23.740> so<00:07:24.310> we<00:07:24.880> try<00:07:25.120> to<00:07:25.150> develop<00:07:25.660> Abdulle<00:07:26.350> like

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
system so we try to develop Abdulle like

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.320 
system so we try to develop Abdulle like
a<00:07:26.620> fight<00:07:26.920> hearing<00:07:27.370> and<00:07:27.520> under<00:07:27.850> this<00:07:28.000> winter

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
a fight hearing and under this winter

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.880 
a fight hearing and under this winter
conditions<00:07:28.870> and<00:07:30.390> hope<00:07:31.390> and<00:07:31.690> we<00:07:32.170> are<00:07:32.290> sure<00:07:32.530> the

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
conditions and hope and we are sure the

conditions and hope and we are sure the
customer<00:07:33.820> satisfied<00:07:34.360> and<00:07:34.660> fun<00:07:35.620> with<00:07:35.800> this<00:07:35.890> car

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
customer satisfied and fun with this car

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.300 
customer satisfied and fun with this car
on<00:07:37.180> the<00:07:37.300> test<00:07:37.540> centre<00:07:37.960> we<00:07:38.110> just<00:07:38.560> really<00:07:39.040> tried

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
on the test centre we just really tried

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.659 
on the test centre we just really tried
to

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669 
to

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.619 
to
testing<00:07:41.389> their<00:07:41.569> systems<00:07:42.169> completely<00:07:43.629> under

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:44.629 
testing their systems completely under

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.760 
testing their systems completely under
this<00:07:44.870> special<00:07:45.590> winter<00:07:46.009> conditions<00:07:46.490> and<00:07:47.770> we

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770 
this special winter conditions and we

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.309 
this special winter conditions and we
decide<00:07:49.639> the<00:07:49.969> very<00:07:50.180> important<00:07:50.719> ones<00:07:50.930> and<00:07:51.110> say

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 
decide the very important ones and say

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.040 
decide the very important ones and say
they<00:07:51.590> may<00:07:52.250> be<00:07:52.280> dangerous<00:07:52.639> once<00:07:53.210> we<00:07:53.569> do<00:07:53.750> on<00:07:53.930> the

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.050 
they may be dangerous once we do on the

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.920 
they may be dangerous once we do on the
district<00:07:54.620> on<00:07:54.949> they're<00:07:55.280> on<00:07:55.639> the<00:07:55.909> lakes<00:07:56.150> and<00:07:56.569> on

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930 
district on they're on the lakes and on
