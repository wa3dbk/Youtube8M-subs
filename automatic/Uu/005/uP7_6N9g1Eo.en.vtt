the body for instance it's considerably

the body for instance it's considerably
larger<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.610> heavier<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> camera<00:00:15.360> like

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620 
the Sony NEX f3 but in the DSLR category

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
is really small it weighs just under a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090 
is really small it weighs just under a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
pound and a half with the kit lens on
and<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.670> definitely<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> camera<00:00:24.480> you're

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and it's definitely not a camera you're

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
and it's definitely not a camera you're
ever<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> put<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.199> your<00:00:25.260> pocket<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.920> it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
ever going to put in your pocket but it

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
ever going to put in your pocket but it
goes<00:00:26.220> nicely<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> bag<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> backpack<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
goes nicely into a bag or a backpack and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
goes nicely into a bag or a backpack and
certainly<00:00:29.160> isn't<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.580> big<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:29.910> most<00:00:30.090> DSLRs

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
certainly isn't as big as most DSLRs

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.179 
certainly isn't as big as most DSLRs
we've<00:00:30.689> seen<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> grip<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> front

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we've seen there's a grip on the front

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.380 
we've seen there's a grip on the front
for<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.610> hand<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> little

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
for your right hand but it's a little

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
for your right hand but it's a little
small<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> angled<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> oddly<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
small and angled kind of oddly so it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.830 
small and angled kind of oddly so it's
not<00:00:35.670> quite<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.000> comfortable<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.360> hold<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> one

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
not quite as comfortable to hold in one

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.360 
not quite as comfortable to hold in one
hand<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> could<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.649> there's<00:00:38.100> also<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
hand as it could be there's also a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
hand as it could be there's also a
pop-up<00:00:38.610> flash<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> camera<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.110> not

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pop-up flash on the camera but it's not

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
pop-up flash on the camera but it's not
very<00:00:40.590> versatile<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.730> blasts

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

also<00:04:08.820> really<00:04:09.000> good<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.570> built<00:04:09.900> into

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
also really good it's built into

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.050 
also really good it's built into
Samsung's<00:04:10.709> lenses<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.700> works<00:04:11.850> really

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
Samsung's lenses and just works really

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.970 
Samsung's lenses and just works really
well<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.750> camera<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.050> pretty<00:04:13.140> fast<00:04:13.440> too<00:04:13.739> it

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
well the camera is pretty fast too it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.710 
well the camera is pretty fast too it
can<00:04:14.220> turn<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.700> capture<00:04:14.970> shot<00:04:15.209> about<00:04:15.480> two

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
can turn on and capture shot about two

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.150 
can turn on and capture shot about two
and<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> half<00:04:15.959> seconds<00:04:16.350> which<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.500> fast<00:04:16.919> without

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and a half seconds which is fast without

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.789 
and a half seconds which is fast without
being<00:04:17.549> overly<00:04:18.180> impressive<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:19.500> single

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
being overly impressive and in single

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.710 
being overly impressive and in single
shot<00:04:19.950> mode<00:04:19.980> can<00:04:20.280> take<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> picture<00:04:20.850> about<00:04:21.209> every

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
shot mode can take a picture about every

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.750 
shot mode can take a picture about every
second<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.500> half<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.950> continuous<00:04:23.640> shooting

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
second and a half in continuous shooting

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.460 
second and a half in continuous shooting
it<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.120> take<00:04:24.240> about<00:04:24.419> eight<00:04:24.660> shots<00:04:24.930> per<00:04:25.140> second

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
it can take about eight shots per second

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.290 
it can take about eight shots per second
but<00:04:25.590> only<00:04:25.770> up<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.010> about<00:04:26.039> 13<00:04:26.669> shots<00:04:27.000> at

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
but only up to about 13 shots at

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.659 
but only up to about 13 shots at
basically<00:04:27.990> freezes<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.830> about<00:04:28.979> 15<00:04:29.340> seconds

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
basically freezes for about 15 seconds

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.550 
basically freezes for about 15 seconds
while<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:29.879> processes<00:04:30.539> all<00:04:30.659> the<00:04:30.690> images<00:04:31.110> that's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
while it processes all the images that's

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.749 
while it processes all the images that's
not<00:04:31.740> good<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.069> might<00:04:32.220> actually<00:04:32.310> mean<00:04:32.639> you

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
not good and might actually mean you

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.730 
not good and might actually mean you
miss<00:04:33.060> more<00:04:33.300> shots<00:04:33.629> than<00:04:33.960> you'd<00:04:34.080> think<00:04:34.110> there

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
miss more shots than you'd think there

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.559 
miss more shots than you'd think there
are<00:04:34.830> very<00:04:34.979> few<00:04:35.190> things<00:04:35.370> wrong<00:04:35.789> with<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.210> nx20

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
are very few things wrong with the nx20

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.149 
are very few things wrong with the nx20
it's<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.900> great<00:04:37.110> camera<00:04:37.379> but<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> problem<00:04:38.069> is

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
it's a great camera but the problem is

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.210 
it's a great camera but the problem is
it's<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:38.550> too<00:04:38.759> expensive<00:04:39.150> at<00:04:39.979> $1,099<00:04:40.979> it's

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
it's just too expensive at $1,099 it's

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.589 
it's just too expensive at $1,099 it's
or<00:04:41.400> expensive<00:04:41.759> than<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.879> lot<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.150> Micro<00:04:42.419> Four

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
or expensive than a lot of Micro Four

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.029 
or expensive than a lot of Micro Four
Thirds<00:04:42.629> cameras<00:04:43.199> it's<00:04:43.530> also<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.830> lot<00:04:43.979> more

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
Thirds cameras it's also a lot more

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.469 
Thirds cameras it's also a lot more
expensive<00:04:44.520> than<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.729> number<00:04:44.909> of<00:04:45.120> entry-level

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
expensive than a number of entry-level

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.290 
expensive than a number of entry-level
DSLRs<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.830> nx20<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.490> really<00:04:47.879> good<00:04:48.030> camera

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
DSLRs the nx20 is a really good camera

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.610 
DSLRs the nx20 is a really good camera
but<00:04:48.690> I'm<00:04:48.840> not<00:04:49.020> sure<00:04:49.530> who<00:04:49.740> I'd<00:04:49.889> recommend<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.430> to
