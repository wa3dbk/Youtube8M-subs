00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.350 
someone asked am I going to have surgery
on<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.660> hand<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.460> am<00:00:32.460> NOT<00:00:32.669> having<00:00:32.969> issues<00:00:33.329> with

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
on this hand I am NOT having issues with

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.500 
on this hand I am NOT having issues with
it<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.870> never<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:35.120> except<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it I never really have except for when I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
it I never really have except for when I
was<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.899> pregnant<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.559> son<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
was just pregnant with my son and I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.369 
was just pregnant with my son and I
think<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.200> bit<00:00:40.320> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
think that's just a little bit of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
think that's just a little bit of
swelling<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> issues<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.329> gone<00:00:43.020> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
swelling and issues so that's gone but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
swelling and issues so that's gone but
I've<00:00:44.010> never<00:00:44.160> ever<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.210> any

I've never ever had you know any
problems<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> won't<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.590> having

15<00:03:53.170> months<00:03:53.440> or<00:03:53.590> so

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
15 months or so

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.429 
15 months or so
um<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.129> basically<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.939> I<00:03:57.450> would<00:03:58.109> say

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
um so that's basically it I would say

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.860 
um so that's basically it I would say
that<00:04:00.139> about<00:04:01.139> a<00:04:01.769> month<00:04:02.400> after<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:03.180> surgery<00:04:03.629> my

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
that about a month after the surgery my

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.470 
that about a month after the surgery my
forearm<00:04:04.829> ached<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.310> little<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.120> had<00:04:06.299> been

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
forearm ached a little and it had been

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.089 
forearm ached a little and it had been
aching<00:04:06.599> before<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.230> surgery<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:07.859> kind

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
aching before the surgery so that kind

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.739 
aching before the surgery so that kind
of<00:04:08.129> made<00:04:08.249> me<00:04:08.280> nervous<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:08.969> I<00:04:09.239> think<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.629> was

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:09.749 
of made me nervous but I think it was

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.369 
of made me nervous but I think it was
just<00:04:09.930> things<00:04:10.200> working<00:04:11.069> its<00:04:11.250> way<00:04:11.549> out<00:04:12.379> because

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
just things working its way out because

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.740 
just things working its way out because
that<00:04:13.500> went<00:04:13.709> away<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.280> then<00:04:14.609> I<00:04:14.639> would<00:04:14.909> say<00:04:15.329> at

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that went away and then I would say at

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.800 
that went away and then I would say at
about<00:04:16.470> eight<00:04:16.680> weeks<00:04:16.949> out<00:04:17.220> I

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
about eight weeks out I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.689 
about eight weeks out I
there<00:04:19.109> was<00:04:19.259> like<00:04:19.410> no<00:04:19.440> signs<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.370> anything

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
there was like no signs of anything

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.460 
there was like no signs of anything
because<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.840> when<00:04:21.989> you're<00:04:22.079> cut<00:04:22.320> you

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
because you know when you're cut you

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.589 
because you know when you're cut you
will<00:04:22.710> be<00:04:22.860> sore<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.460> you'll<00:04:23.970> see<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.270> bruise

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
will be sore it you'll see the bruise

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.629 
will be sore it you'll see the bruise
and<00:04:25.050> then<00:04:25.289> when<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.620> bruise<00:04:25.889> like<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
and then when the bruise like the

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.029 
and then when the bruise like the
darkness<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.210> gone<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.870> will<00:04:28.110> be<00:04:28.259> tender<00:04:28.860> to

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
darkness is gone it will be tender to

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.400 
darkness is gone it will be tender to
touch<00:04:29.539> so<00:04:30.539> I<00:04:30.570> would<00:04:30.720> say<00:04:30.840> about<00:04:31.020> eight<00:04:31.199> weeks

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
touch so I would say about eight weeks

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.350 
touch so I would say about eight weeks
later<00:04:31.560> there<00:04:32.130> was<00:04:32.250> no<00:04:32.460> sign<00:04:32.729> of<00:04:32.759> anything<00:04:33.120> you

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
later there was no sign of anything you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.779 
later there was no sign of anything you
could<00:04:33.570> touch<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.800> would<00:04:34.919> have<00:04:35.130> no

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
could touch it and you would have no

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.749 
could touch it and you would have no
clue<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> that's<00:04:36.479> where<00:04:36.690> like<00:04:36.840> my<00:04:37.050> issue<00:04:37.949> or

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
clue and that's where like my issue or

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.089 
clue and that's where like my issue or
like<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.180> was<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.720> pain<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:40.410> like<00:04:40.560> soreness

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
like I was like pain but like soreness

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.909 
like I was like pain but like soreness
from<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.520> bruises<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.620> know<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> don't

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
from the bruises but you know I don't

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.040 
from the bruises but you know I don't
say<00:04:44.130> oh<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.520> took<00:04:44.669> me<00:04:44.820> two<00:04:45.000> months<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.630> recover

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
say oh it took me two months to recover

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.469 
say oh it took me two months to recover
because<00:04:46.259> I<00:04:46.470> felt<00:04:46.770> great<00:04:47.130> really<00:04:47.789> fast<00:04:48.090> it's

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
because I felt great really fast it's

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.020 
because I felt great really fast it's
just<00:04:48.810> any<00:04:49.050> sign<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.770> anything<00:04:50.250> was<00:04:50.550> gone<00:04:50.759> after

just any sign of anything was gone after
two<00:04:51.330> months<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:54.830> guess<00:04:55.830> that's<00:04:56.009> about<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.310> I

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
two months and I guess that's about it I

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.490 
two months and I guess that's about it I
did<00:04:57.270> get<00:04:57.419> pregnant<00:04:57.599> right<00:04:57.840> after<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.259> surgery

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
was pregnant which was great because I

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.110 
was pregnant which was great because I
didn't<00:05:07.470> sleep<00:05:07.620> for<00:05:07.800> four<00:05:08.430> months<00:05:08.789> when<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:08.940> was

and then obviously after I had the baby
I<00:05:29.009> don't<00:05:29.370> have<00:05:29.520> any<00:05:29.669> issues<00:05:30.620> now<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.889> the

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
I don't have any issues now in the

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.339 
I don't have any issues now in the
mornings<00:05:32.430> my<00:05:33.000> hands<00:05:33.389> just<00:05:33.599> feel<00:05:33.810> really<00:05:34.020> tight

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
mornings my hands just feel really tight

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.779 
mornings my hands just feel really tight
but<00:05:34.590> that's<00:05:34.680> started<00:05:35.190> when<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.400> was<00:05:35.520> pregnant

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
but that's started when I was pregnant

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.180 
but that's started when I was pregnant
too<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.360> hasn't<00:05:36.570> really<00:05:36.750> gone<00:05:37.080> away<00:05:37.289> so<00:05:38.159> I

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
too and it hasn't really gone away so I

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.300 
too and it hasn't really gone away so I
think<00:05:38.490> it's<00:05:39.210> entirely<00:05:39.860> different<00:05:40.860> issues

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
think it's entirely different issues

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.070 
think it's entirely different issues
than<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.669> carpal<00:05:42.000> tunnel<00:05:42.330> it's<00:05:42.479> more<00:05:42.780> like<00:05:42.960> my

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
than the carpal tunnel it's more like my

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.399 
than the carpal tunnel it's more like my
fingers<00:05:43.560> which<00:05:43.979> who<00:05:44.729> knows

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
fingers which who knows

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.279 
fingers which who knows
