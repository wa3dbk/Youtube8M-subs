 the States - Mediacenter over the city Batman or they all express 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.080
 Just click the Green Medias enter button on your remote 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.530
 because the Mediacenter can be classically controlled with mouse and keyboard 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.070
 but it is more comfortable with a fit fortune 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 so they have all the functions even from the sofa in a circle 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.250

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.170
 Monitor or watch notebook Indira tv card or the video card 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 You can usually also connect the TV 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.950
 The fastest way to get there is the Express Time 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.120
 Settings made, for example, if an internet connection exists 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 you will always need this if you later use the current tv program 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.150
 leader 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.340
 or want to use additional online services 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.920
 it continues with the set up of the television radio Zion however they can 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 Only use the TV production if you have a Windows Media Center 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.940
 compatible tv card for example internally built into your PC respectively 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.240
 as externally connected via USB 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 Here they would be out for the region Germany 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 depending on how you receive the tv signal you need the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.970
 tv card fitting verkam there are different possibilities at the moment 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.020
 tv signals to receive 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.460
 via an analog cable connection a digital cable connection with a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.620
 set-top-box or via a digital satellite connection short dvb-s or 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.800
 via dvb-t in our case we configure the tv-reception over 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.320
 DVB-T 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.770
 the TV program offers a program overview what is currently in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.450
 Television is just running in digital form 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 because they want Windows Media Center can use the TV program for that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.409
 automatically for the next 14 days via the Internet 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.069
 Now they still have the legal advice to vote 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.410
 their zip code is therefore needed so that Windows Media Center will get the correct ones 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.409
 regional attitude takes over 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.719
 if they now match the fake region the tv signal provider 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.499
 now the individual tv stations are searched 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.069
 Incidentally, the number of stations found can vary depending on where they are 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.069
 live 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.659
 These tv stations are currently available 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.959
