they did it anyway

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.979 
and so that was how the kir originated
and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> Cure<00:00:47.520> Royale<00:00:47.879> same<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.809> but

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989

topping<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> off<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.680> champagne<00:00:50.370> instead<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
topping it off with champagne instead of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.810 
topping it off with champagne instead of
white<00:00:51.329> wine<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> kir<00:00:53.100> Royale<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:53.670> is

measure it out and I would say that it's
approximately<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.390> half<00:01:36.840> ounce<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
that's how I like mine which is a

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's how I like mine which is a
maybe<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.619> touch<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.130> sweet<00:01:49.490> side<00:01:49.759> actually

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
maybe a touch on the sweet side actually

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.760 
maybe a touch on the sweet side actually
and<00:01:50.539> then<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.140> finished<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.710> a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
