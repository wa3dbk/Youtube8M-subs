with clean fall otherwise they'll dry up
and<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.320> will<00:04:24.500> be<00:04:24.650> hard<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.039> fold<00:04:25.280> dumplings

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
and it will be hard to fold dumplings

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.650 
and it will be hard to fold dumplings
later<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:27.639> now<00:04:28.639> put<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> filling<00:04:29.419> into<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
later on now put the filling into the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.870 
later on now put the filling into the

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.990 
dumplings have a thin skin and a lot of
filling<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.599> more<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:35.960> can<00:04:36.140> stop<00:04:36.469> them

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
filling so the more you can stop them

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.720 
filling so the more you can stop them
but<00:04:37.150> today<00:04:37.390> are<00:04:37.570> supposedly<00:04:38.500> I'm<00:04:39.250> putting

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.030 
filling into one dumpling now there are
several<00:04:46.390> folding<00:04:46.900> methods<00:04:47.260> for<00:04:47.380> dumplings<00:04:47.830> as

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
several folding methods for dumplings as

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.010 
several folding methods for dumplings as
some<00:04:48.400> believe<00:04:48.670> with<00:04:49.210> different<00:04:49.660> folding

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
some believe with different folding

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.600 
some believe with different folding
techniques<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.590> dumplings<00:04:51.070> will<00:04:51.160> absorb

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
techniques the dumplings will absorb

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.370 
techniques the dumplings will absorb
very<00:04:51.850> ating<00:04:52.270> amounts<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.900> dipping<00:04:53.170> sauce

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
very ating amounts of the dipping sauce

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.220 
very ating amounts of the dipping sauce
but<00:04:54.190> honestly<00:04:54.670> I<00:04:54.970> just<00:04:55.360> pick<00:04:55.540> whatever<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.990> like
