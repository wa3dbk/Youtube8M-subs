butter here so I'm going to add these
together<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.840> use<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> blender<00:01:28.380> or

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
together and you can use a blender or

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
together and you can use a blender or
whisk<00:01:29.549> blenders<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.570> easier<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
whisk blenders going to be easier and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.999 
whisk blenders going to be easier and
you<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> beat<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.150> together<00:01:33.390> until

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
you want to beat this all together until

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.609 
you want to beat this all together until
it<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.610> creamy<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> might<00:01:37.350> take<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it is all creamy so it might take a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
it is all creamy so it might take a
second<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
second but it's if you want to get it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
second but it's if you want to get it
really<00:01:39.990> mixed<00:01:40.350> up

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.190 

it's<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.759> really<00:01:49.030> thick<00:01:49.270> batter<00:01:49.509> so<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:49.990> might

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
it's a really thick batter so you might

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.219 
it's a really thick batter so you might
want<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.920> use<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.069> blender<00:01:51.399> if<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:51.729> one

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
want to use a blender if you have one

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.609 
want to use a blender if you have one
otherwise<00:01:53.229> which<00:01:53.619> works<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.069> alright<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
otherwise which works just alright so

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.870 
otherwise which works just alright so
you'll<00:01:59.770> get<00:01:59.859> something<00:02:00.159> kind<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.549> like<00:02:00.670> that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you'll get something kind of like that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.309 
you'll get something kind of like that
I'm<00:02:01.119> gonna<00:02:01.240> blend<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.719> little<00:02:01.750> bit<00:02:02.140> more

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
I'm gonna blend it a little bit more

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.899 
I'm gonna blend it a little bit more
because<00:02:02.679> I'm<00:02:02.920> not<00:02:03.039> using<00:02:03.219> blender<00:02:03.609> I<00:02:03.670> want<00:02:03.849> to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
because I'm not using blender I want to

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.699 
because I'm not using blender I want to
get<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.090> really<00:02:04.209> good<00:02:04.329> but<00:02:04.689> once<00:02:05.319> it<00:02:05.439> gets<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.619> a

creamy<00:02:05.950> consistency<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:06.819> that<00:02:07.000> you're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
creamy consistency like that you're

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.850 
creamy consistency like that you're
ready<00:02:07.630> for<00:02:07.719> the<00:02:07.899> next<00:02:07.929> step<00:02:10.620> now<00:02:11.620> we'll<00:02:11.769> go

now and now we're basically getting

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.610 
now and now we're basically getting
close<00:03:09.500> now<00:03:10.489> we<00:03:10.549> have<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.150> add<00:03:11.659> in<00:03:12.340> our<00:03:14.290> our<00:03:15.290> dry

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
gradually so don't just pour all this in

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.479 
gradually so don't just pour all this in
at<00:03:22.040> once

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
at once

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.160 
at once
add<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.269> little<00:03:23.480> bit<00:03:23.569> at<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.750> time<00:03:26.170> otherwise

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
add in a little bit at a time otherwise

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.259 
add in a little bit at a time otherwise
it's<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.500> gonna<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.890> too<00:03:28.700> much<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.150> it's

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
it's just gonna be too much and it's

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.240 
it's just gonna be too much and it's
just<00:03:29.299> gonna<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:29.629> fly<00:03:29.870> all<00:03:29.930> over<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:31.069> I'm<00:03:31.160> gonna

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
just gonna all fly all over so I'm gonna

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.180 
just gonna all fly all over so I'm gonna
go<00:03:31.400> ahead<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.730> keep<00:03:31.879> adding<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.359> slowly<00:03:32.750> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
go ahead and keep adding this slowly and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.410 
go ahead and keep adding this slowly and
now<00:03:34.190> it's<00:03:34.400> gonna<00:03:34.489> get<00:03:34.670> harder<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.150> stir

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
now it's gonna get harder to stir

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.729 
now it's gonna get harder to stir
because<00:03:35.599> it's<00:03:35.810> gonna<00:03:35.900> keep<00:03:36.170> getting<00:03:36.290> thicker
