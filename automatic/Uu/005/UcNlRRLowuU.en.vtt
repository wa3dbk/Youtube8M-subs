00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.159
 the sodium carbonate accelerate processes reducing the point of 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.620
 sand casting from 2 thousand 300 degrees to less than 700 thousand 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.399
 the limestone extracted limestone mobility that indicates that the crystal is 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 dissolves in water 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.119
 they even add some pieces of residual glass that they smoke to recycle it 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.589
 and thus keep the cost of the island low before such reduce the raw material 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 necessary to manufacture fiberglass 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.900
 the oven works with electricity generated by the state follow before 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.060
 the 700 degree family mix is ​​heated and transformed into molten glass 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.410
 as the crystal melts it goes through a hole to the bottom of the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.240
 molten 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.090
 a mechanical arm that is already passing by fired hot glass towards a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.000
 machine called shooter 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.140
 that through turns turn liquid crystal into fibers 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.720
 the molten glass is poured into a rotating cylinder that holds thousands of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.400
 small holes in the data 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 the rotating action in glass villa outward through the holes and what 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.480
 they separate thin glass strands as the fibers come out a burst 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.870
 of fresh air the simple one and pushes them down where a binding agent 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.070
 the yesterday with each other 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.360
 when leaving the machine the fiber decided to look like cotton candy 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.189
 White 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.439
 and can even be placed around a wire like cotton candy 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.720
 the fiberglass threads are thinner than a human hair 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 and they are bad conductors of heat 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 but it is the air between them that transforms the fiberglass into a good 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.760
 insulating 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.770
 of the random order of the airbags that reduces the movement of air to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.360
 through fiberglass that's why hot air is harder 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 go through the insulation 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 when the thin glass fibers come out of the machine 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.359
 they let them rest in layers of 30 centimeters thick and two meters and 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.080
 half wide 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 then it will split in those layers of three 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.259
 and transport them to a curing oven 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.929
 heat the oven to 230 degrees 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:22.579
 to discuss the adhesive sprayed on the stones and achieve that the three layers 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.819
 Eguna 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.540
 in the clusters inside the furnace pressure to fiber layers 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.400
 of glass 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 to compress them until they are 20 centimeters thick 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.060
 if the compression comes back you want the layer the airbags will be smaller 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.639
 that in a fluffy layer 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.149
 and to the result to be even better sets 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.099
 two minutes later the layer leaves the oven and passes a time tunnel 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.109
 what envy and towards the fiberglass to cool it the room temperature 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.109
 before they cut each layer the size of 4 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.639
 to give the layers the size of the insulators 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.819
 a mountain of Xunta cuts them half as if it were a cake to separate the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 two layers of 10 centimeters thick each 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.599
 then five spatial rotating knives work as carriers of 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.579
 giant pita 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 and cut the layers lengthwise into six equal pieces 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.549
 Each strip is 37 centimeters wide and this is the width of the island. 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.079
 determined 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.309
 is a conventional measure in the industry by 15 wide that is woven 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.859
 between the braces of the walls of homes that require this island before 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.259
 once they cut the strips 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.569
 on one side with a wood paper that has an asphalt coating 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 the asphalt is the same as used in the streets 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 provides the island with a barrier against moisture 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.939
 that prevents mold from covering the walls 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:59.169
 a roller heated to 160 degrees melts the asphalt to adhere to 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.169
 fiberglass 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.299
 when the paper was decided 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.219
 tinaquillo sina corp to the lives of insulator in individual pieces called 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.759
 bates 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.120
 Each piece has two points 4 meters long to fit perfectly in 

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:19.909
 a wall of two and a half meters high and once they cut the insulation 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:20.449
 measure 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.639
 who pays the debts and send them to keep the homes broths send it
