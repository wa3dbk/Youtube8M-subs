because<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.640> it's<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.299> of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
because I I think it's because of

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
because I I think it's because of
society<00:03:01.019> per<00:03:01.230> se<00:03:01.470> because<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
society per se because they have this

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.220 
society per se because they have this
label<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.239> they<00:03:03.359> put<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.720> women<00:03:04.079> who<00:03:04.170> are

label that they put on women who are
married<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.769> think<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.370> because<00:03:05.609> of<00:03:05.700> society

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
married I think it's because of society

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.030

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
it's very sad but the point is that in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.319 
it's very sad but the point is that in
today's<00:03:30.930> 21st<00:03:31.560> century<00:03:32.280> or<00:03:32.430> 22nd<00:03:32.970> century<00:03:33.090> or

today's 21st century or 22nd century or
whatever<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.840> don't<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.889> applies

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220

whatever I don't think that that applies
I<00:03:35.609> don't<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.419> applies<00:03:36.690> anymore<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.380> I

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
I don't think that applies anymore and I

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.409 
I don't think that applies anymore and I
think<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.799> each<00:03:38.010> person<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.700> an<00:03:38.880> individual

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
think that each person is an individual

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.129 
think that each person is an individual
and<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:40.620> individuality<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.910> what<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.989> guy

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
and your individuality is what the guy

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.819 
and your individuality is what the guy
married<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.620> for<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.370> don't<00:03:44.459> give<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.730> up
