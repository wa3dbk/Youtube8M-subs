monkeys we're going to go into a move

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
monkeys we're going to go into a move
called<00:00:21.390> hold<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> ball<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.650> a

called hold the ball which is really a
transitional<00:00:23.490> move<00:00:23.750> we<00:00:24.750> empty<00:00:25.230> step<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
transitional move we empty step out and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
transitional move we empty step out and
our<00:00:27.480> weight<00:00:27.750> shifts<00:00:29.000> arms<00:00:30.000> reach<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
our weight shifts arms reach to the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.000 
our weight shifts arms reach to the
corner<00:00:31.140> our<00:00:31.470> weight<00:00:32.430> comes<00:00:32.790> back<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> right

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
corner our weight comes back the right

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.250 
hand pivots around on top of the wrist
folds<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.440> press<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> arms<00:00:42.899> come

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
folds down and we press the arms come

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.510 
folds down and we press the arms come
apart<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.789> weight<00:00:44.969> shifts<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.520> then

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
apart as the weight shifts back and then

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.650 
apart as the weight shifts back and then
we<00:00:47.760> press<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> let<00:00:51.570> me

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
we press out one more time so let me

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.900 
we press out one more time so let me
show<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.320> grass<00:00:52.680> birds<00:00:53.010> tear<00:00:53.399> tail

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
show you the grass birds tear tail

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
show you the grass birds tear tail
series<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> side<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
series from the side so you can see the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160 
series from the side so you can see the
moves<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> angle<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.809> just

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
moves from that angle and so we just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.369 
moves from that angle and so we just
finished<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> repulse<00:00:59.160> monkeys<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.899> hold<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
finished the repulse monkeys we hold the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.289 
finished the repulse monkeys we hold the
ball<00:01:02.660> step<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:05.750> reach<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> corner

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
ball step out reach for the corner

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.899 
ball step out reach for the corner
weight<00:01:09.299> comes<00:01:09.720> back<00:01:11.659> hand<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> wrist

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
weight comes back hand on the wrist

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.020 
weight comes back hand on the wrist
press<00:01:15.920> apart<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:18.470> push<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.310> we'll<00:01:20.729> real

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
press apart and push and we'll real

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
press apart and push and we'll real
quick<00:01:21.299> show<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> martial<00:01:22.049> applications<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
quick show the martial applications of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
quick show the martial applications of
that<00:01:22.860> move<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.240> although

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that move as well and so although

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
that move as well and so although
there's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> variations<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> can

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there's a lot of variations what we can

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
there's a lot of variations what we can
do<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> series<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
do basically this is a series of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
do basically this is a series of
opportunities<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
opportunities to really just kind of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
opportunities to really just kind of
punch<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> slap<00:01:30.329> somebody<00:01:30.570> around<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.140> little

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
punch and slap somebody around a little

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.969 
punch and slap somebody around a little
bit<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> went<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.430> hold<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> ball<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
bit so we went from hold the ball to a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.510 
bit so we went from hold the ball to a
sternum<00:01:35.670> strike<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.340> grab

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sternum strike and we can actually grab

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
sternum strike and we can actually grab
the<00:01:38.670> arm<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> sweep<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.259> come<00:01:40.530> back

the arm and do a sweep and we come back

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
the arm and do a sweep and we come back
we're<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.490> supporting<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> wrist<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.659> we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we're now supporting the wrist and we

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.300 
we're now supporting the wrist and we
can<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> wrist<00:01:43.380> strike<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.920> hit<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.159> right

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
can do a wrist strike we hit them right

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
can do a wrist strike we hit them right
in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> xiphoid<00:01:44.880> process<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.750> stop<00:01:45.930> their
