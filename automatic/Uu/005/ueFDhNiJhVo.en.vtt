it ain't broke don't fix it so this is

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.570 
it ain't broke don't fix it so this is
something<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.710> they've<00:00:42.949> had<00:00:42.980> going<00:00:43.309> for<00:00:43.400> a

something that they've had going for a
long<00:00:43.850> time<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:45.410> year<00:00:45.800> armada<00:00:46.280> stuck<00:00:47.090> with

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
long time so this year armada stuck with

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.060 
long time so this year armada stuck with
its<00:00:47.480> tried<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.930> true<00:00:48.110> dimensions<00:00:48.500> and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
its tried and true dimensions and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.400 
its tried and true dimensions and
lengths<00:00:49.460> for<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.760> arw<00:00:50.450> but<00:00:50.630> what<00:00:50.750> they<00:00:50.870> did<00:00:51.170> do

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
lengths for the arw but what they did do

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.710 
lengths for the arw but what they did do
was<00:00:51.980> change<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.370> flex<00:00:52.760> pattern<00:00:53.000> just<00:00:53.540> a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
was change the flex pattern just a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.860 
was change the flex pattern just a
little<00:00:54.020> bit<00:00:54.140> by<00:00:54.320> adding<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.710> denser<00:00:55.340> would

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
little bit by adding a denser would

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.960 
little bit by adding a denser would
underfoot<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.110> then<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.800> little<00:00:58.070> bit<00:00:58.489> less

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
underfoot and then a little bit less

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.450 
underfoot and then a little bit less
dense<00:00:59.329> wood<00:00:59.630> and<00:00:59.899> the<00:00:59.989> tip<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.440> tail<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.040> that

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
dense wood and the tip and tail and that

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.790 
dense wood and the tip and tail and that
really<00:01:01.880> provides<00:01:02.180> for<00:01:02.719> a<00:01:02.750> more<00:01:03.050> even<00:01:03.260> more

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
really provides for a more even more

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.090 
really provides for a more even more
light<00:01:04.160> swing<00:01:04.550> wait<00:01:04.780> for<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.840> AR<00:01:06.140> w<00:01:06.350> Armada

light swing wait for the AR w Armada

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.460 
light swing wait for the AR w Armada
held<00:01:07.399> true<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.820> its<00:01:08.240> proven<00:01:08.780> park<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.320> pipe

held true to its proven park and pipe
construction<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.580> they<00:01:10.700> use<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:10.940> all<00:01:11.420> of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
construction that they use and all of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.650 
construction that they use and all of
their<00:01:11.869> AR<00:01:12.380> series<00:01:12.800> as<00:01:13.040> well<00:01:13.610> as<00:01:13.940> their<00:01:14.360> tanner

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
their AR series as well as their tanner

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.930 
their AR series as well as their tanner
hall<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.020> pipe<00:01:15.200> cleaner<00:01:15.470> skis<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.100> basically

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
hall and pipe cleaner skis and basically

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.710 
hall and pipe cleaner skis and basically
you're<00:01:17.300> looking<00:01:18.110> at<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.680> BF<00:01:19.100> sidewalls<00:01:19.720> there

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
you're looking at a BF sidewalls there

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.550 
you're looking at a BF sidewalls there
at<00:01:20.869> third<00:01:20.950> s7<00:01:21.950> base<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.520> double<00:01:22.940> zone<00:01:23.360> core<00:01:23.840> so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
at third s7 base and double zone core so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.289 
at third s7 base and double zone core so
everything<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.130> Armada<00:01:25.520> uses<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.180> make

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
everything that Armada uses to make

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.300 
everything that Armada uses to make
their<00:01:26.450> skis<00:01:26.720> perform<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.530> well<00:01:27.650> in<00:01:28.100> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
their skis perform really well in the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.010 
their skis perform really well in the
park<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.670> pipe<00:01:28.850> they<00:01:29.150> also<00:01:29.360> use<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.900> their

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
park and pipe they also use in their

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.240 
park and pipe they also use in their
women<00:01:30.290> flying

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.990 

so<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.060> amp<00:01:37.420> little<00:01:37.960> or<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:39.369> Amplatz

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
so this is the amp little or an Amplatz

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.520 
so this is the amp little or an Amplatz
most<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.330> their<00:01:40.420> skis<00:01:40.720> actually<00:01:41.200> all<00:01:41.320> their

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
most of their skis actually all their

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.560 
most of their skis actually all their
skis<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.979> Germany<00:01:42.460> or<00:01:42.640> they<00:01:43.270> actually

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
skis in Germany or they actually

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.469 
skis in Germany or they actually
engineer<00:01:43.960> step<00:01:44.170> right<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.770> Alps<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.240> they

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
engineer step right in the Alps and they

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.390 
engineer step right in the Alps and they
have<00:01:46.780> been<00:01:47.050> kind<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.470> making<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.830> bigger<00:01:48.040> impact

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
have been kind of making a bigger impact

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.940 
have been kind of making a bigger impact
over<00:01:48.759> here<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.390> States<00:01:49.800> one<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
over here in the States one of the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.160 
over here in the States one of the
things<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.280> amplitude<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.869> ting<00:01:53.050> their

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
things that amplitude of a ting their

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.550 
things that amplitude of a ting their
women's<00:01:53.500> skis<00:01:53.830> as<00:01:54.729> they<00:01:54.909> took<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.810> molds<00:01:56.470> from

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
women's skis as they took the molds from

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.990 
women's skis as they took the molds from
their<00:01:56.770> Township<00:01:57.220> series<00:01:57.550> which<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.850> their

their Township series which is their

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120 
their Township series which is their
men's<00:01:58.300> Park<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.810> pipe<00:01:58.930> line<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.470> they

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
men's Park and pipe line and they

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.130 
men's Park and pipe line and they
softened<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.700> up<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.940> bit<00:02:00.970> both<00:02:01.479> torsionally

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
softened it up a bit both torsionally

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.499 
softened it up a bit both torsionally
and<00:02:02.460> longitudinally<00:02:03.460> making<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.330> little

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
and longitudinally making it a little

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.169 
and longitudinally making it a little
softer<00:02:04.840> flex<00:02:05.290> for<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.770> ladies<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:07.030> at<00:02:07.149> our

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
softer flex for the ladies and at our

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.570 
softer flex for the ladies and at our
ski<00:02:07.570> tests<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.019> year<00:02:08.080> people<00:02:09.009> thought<00:02:09.190> this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
ski tests this year people thought this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.550 
ski tests this year people thought this
key<00:02:09.759> skied<00:02:10.030> really<00:02:10.360> smooth<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.959> was<00:02:11.110> really

key skied really smooth and was really

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.590 
key skied really smooth and was really

of call it their jib rocker and they
also<00:03:05.300> added<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:06.110> little<00:03:06.260> bit<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.530> girth

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
also added a little bit of girth

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.430 
also added a little bit of girth
underfoot<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.030> they<00:03:08.180> beefed<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.660> up<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.930> 90

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
underfoot so they beefed it up to 90

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.220 
underfoot so they beefed it up to 90
millimeters<00:03:10.370> underfoot<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.960> does

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
millimeters underfoot and what this does

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.380 
millimeters underfoot and what this does
for<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.710> performance<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.460> ski<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
for the performance of this ski is it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.170 
for the performance of this ski is it
makes<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> little<00:03:14.780> bit<00:03:14.990> more<00:03:15.110> stable<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:16.550> jumps

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
makes a little bit more stable on jumps

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.870 
makes a little bit more stable on jumps
and<00:03:17.360> also<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.080> blade<00:03:18.710> tip<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.220> tip<00:03:19.670> it

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and also with the blade tip and tip it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.720 
and also with the blade tip and tip it
allows<00:03:20.270> for<00:03:20.690> better<00:03:21.440> presses<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.400> butters

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
allows for better presses and butters

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.520 
allows for better presses and butters
and<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.060> kind<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.360> thing<00:03:23.420> but<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.110> also<00:03:24.260> makes

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
and that kind of thing but it also makes

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.320 
and that kind of thing but it also makes
this<00:03:24.710> ski<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> lot<00:03:25.100> more<00:03:25.310> fun<00:03:25.520> all<00:03:25.760> over<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
this ski a lot more fun all over the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.210 
this ski a lot more fun all over the
mountain<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:26.930> take<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.350> into<00:03:27.500> some<00:03:27.830> some

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
mountain you can take it into some some

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.330 
mountain you can take it into some some
deeper<00:03:28.790> snow<00:03:28.850> on<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:30.020> some<00:03:30.230> harder<00:03:30.260> terrain<00:03:30.950> so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
deeper snow on to some harder terrain so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.410 
deeper snow on to some harder terrain so
it<00:03:31.490> basically<00:03:31.640> makes<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.300> great

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
it basically makes it a great
