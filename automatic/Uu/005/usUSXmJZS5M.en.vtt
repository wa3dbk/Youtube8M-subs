00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:17.060
 I am a medical student hello I am jose 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.760
 Manuel studied medicine third 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.519
 Elena Dávalos and Sara Santervás 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.519
 students of basic biomedicine and 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.529
 hello my name experiments barrow and 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.189
 study in excess of medicine in plan 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.189
 2001 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 and I'm going to complain a little about the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.059
 classes most teachers do not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.100
 they should have passed a course of 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.870
 pedagogical attitudes since at 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.910
 unique that are dedicated to reading powerpoint 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.739
 obviously for that I stay in my 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 home and I'm advancing studies for my 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.230
 part hours of teachers that by 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.600
 obligation they have to give licenses and it's 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.780
 when the lack of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.129
 interest to get out of trouble 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.530
 fulfills the expectation the qualification of 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.930
 biomedicine an expectation of 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.990
 organization 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.340
 yes it does meet many expectations 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.440
 know that we do not have any end projects 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.790
 of degree that we have many capes 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.460
 tied to the air the truth is yes 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.760
 we are very very calm not 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.760
 obviously we are not the problems 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.340
 that we have the infrastructure 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.210
 some old buildings have little 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.530
 functional we teach classes in classrooms 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 old without plugs some without 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.220
 emergency exits without ventilation 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.820
 many of them and we also do 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.430
 exams 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.479
 in the aula magna on cartons not 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.690
 we have these bases to carry out the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690
 exams 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.830
 and he talks that they do not even welcome the number 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.960
 of students that are in a group and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.550
 they have to take the tip on the ground what 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.410
 I'm stuck in a no window without 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.420
 emergency exit only with one 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.030
 little door is the bad infrastructure 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.860
 that we have is going to fall on top of us 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.650
 the head and the same I have to learn 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.170
 of them serves as material for 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.050
 practice of the morgue to the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.640
 emergency exit that we do not know if 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.290
 the emergency exit will be 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.850
 available for when I really speak 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.520
 an emergency because of the emergency 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.230
 arise when we use the output 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.240
 effectively advantages the unit the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.860
 The meeting of teaching is that it is not 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.310
 mandatory attendance at least 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.700
 in my plan to the classes for attending 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.290
 class is torture because it bores you 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.780
 very much because they read you a PowerPoint 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
 how well could I read my house to the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 time to give me my desire and not 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.040
 make me go to those places at that time 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.330
 to have one hour of classes or four 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.530
 hours of practice that maybe not 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.190
 I have practice because it does not correspond 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.990
 by 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 and then again having two hours of 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.580
 class so it's super more 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.400
 structured 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.770
 and aside the teachers do not put effort 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.080
 They do not seem to like their job 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.630
 because they do not teach anything 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.630
 and also if he makes any suggestions to you 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.560
 takes into account even issues such as 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.110
 a new degree and such many teachers 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.640
 of this faculty and some departments 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 specifically they refuse to give us class and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.340
 we have come on we have problems with 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.250
 some professors teachers assigned to 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.630
 teach in our degree 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.760
 liquid have been reported to go 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.950
 our career come presupposing that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.080
 we have some with a lot of knowledge 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.360
 that take for granted and pass the agenda 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.370
 because they have had students from 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.700
 medicine and perhaps high courses of 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.010
 medicine and then we do not have the same 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.580
 purpose of study because we do not have 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.580
 the same training 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.350
 practice since most are totally 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.440
 productive because they do not teach you anything if 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.890
 you do not ask they do not listen to you in a 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.890
 ghost 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.750
 even I for example until I do not 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.850
 I came to my place of practice not me 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.300
 I put the robe on and they look at me badly until 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.460
 operator and they do not teach me anything if not yes 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.460
 you do not face him they do not do anything 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.400
 unless you find yourself with some 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.490
 doctor that you really like 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.800
 teach but if you're not a report in 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.070
 against a large hospital is that there 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.270
 many doctors many students and runs the 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.270
 risk of becoming a 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.699
 another box that I had about the practices 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.439
 what to wear in the afternoon and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.229
 also in hospitals that belong to us 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.389
 making us travel and waste a lot of time 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.919
 that I could use in other things a lot 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.979
 more productive in all practices 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:09.580
 in the man faculty missed 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:12.009
 some laboratories we miss in 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.379
 commissions we miss material with 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.150
 the one that can make plastic 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.099
 microscopes we are micro live and 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.530
 practices for Biology 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.900
 please because in one of the practices of 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.759
 last year's biology we could not 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.530
 perform it because it had to be done with 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.090
 an inverted microscope in its place 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.490
 we saw an instructional video on youtube 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.259
 of embryonic development effectively 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.789
 paid a college tuition to see 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.900
 videos on youtube in practices 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.900
 BOLOGNA is great yes 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.639
 they are holes 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.430
 in the case from within 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:54.200
 from within the plan Bologna will be a 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.200
 overcrowded 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.289
 people operating room 56 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.240
 students of grades practically one 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.000
 sardinada is in a better faculty than 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.740
 us and that directly all the 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.599
 world is entitled to its tactics but 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400
 that you can not give a practice of 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.990
 quality with that number of people 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.990
 inside of an operating room 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.930
 this overcrowding 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.540
 and that please have diffusion and this 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.040
 finish with everyone in the 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.160
 Same conditions as we already 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.400
 we know that it probably is not a little 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.910
 this overcrowding this overcrowding 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.910
