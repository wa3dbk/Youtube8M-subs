00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
for color and for shape so we believe

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
for color and for shape so we believe
that<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.259> biscuit<00:01:37.860> baked<00:01:38.100> trying<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> mouth

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that a biscuit baked trying in the mouth

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.050 
that a biscuit baked trying in the mouth
is<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.659> important<00:01:40.289> now<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.340> case<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.850> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
has been a little bit grinded extra

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.090 
has been a little bit grinded extra
grinding<00:02:06.539> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> occlusion<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.770> I'm<00:02:08.069> going

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
grinding on the occlusion so I'm going

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.120 
grinding on the occlusion so I'm going
to<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.549> putting<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:09.000> primary<00:02:09.989> tables<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
to be putting my primary tables back in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.460 
to be putting my primary tables back in
as<00:02:11.310> an<00:02:11.459> occlusion<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:13.019> secondary

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
as an occlusion and a secondary

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.949 
as an occlusion and a secondary
occlusion<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.640> case<00:02:14.940> instead<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.599> can<00:02:15.750> see

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
occlusion this case instead you can see

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.580 
occlusion this case instead you can see
doesn't<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> secondary<00:02:17.190> occlusion<00:02:18.590> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
doesn't have a secondary occlusion and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.330 
doesn't have a secondary occlusion and
you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.489> from<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.950> motors

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
you can see that from the the motors

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
you can see that from the the motors
that<00:02:23.489> are<00:02:23.549> next<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.900> going<00:02:25.049> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
that are next to it so it's going to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.759 
that are next to it so it's going to
have<00:02:25.290> only<00:02:25.470> primary<00:02:25.890> tables<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.769> instead

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
have only primary tables and instead

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.069 
have only primary tables and instead

is going to be dull it's going to be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.759 
is going to be dull it's going to be
transparent<00:02:38.760> what's<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> color<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.590> will

transparent what's the color and we will

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.090 
transparent what's the color and we will
match<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.850> before<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.890> go

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
match that but before this we will be go

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
match that but before this we will be go
through<00:02:44.430> another<00:02:44.730> process<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.569> grinding

will be doing using a diamond burn i
will<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.240> making<00:03:57.390> my<00:03:57.750> margins<00:03:58.230> much<00:03:58.500> thinner

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
will be making my margins much thinner

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.210 
will be making my margins much thinner
and<00:03:59.360> to<00:04:00.360> do<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.870> will<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.050> using<00:04:01.290> by<00:04:01.680> my

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and to do this I will be using by my

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.760 
and to do this I will be using by my
microscope<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.450> my<00:04:03.720> suction<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.350> course

now these particles you don't want to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.060 
now these particles you don't want to
breed<00:04:09.020> them<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.500> don't<00:04:09.680> want<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:09.920> be<00:04:10.010> in

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
breed them and you don't want to be in

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.390 
breed them and you don't want to be in
your<00:04:10.190> hair<00:04:10.460> because<00:04:10.670> they<00:04:10.970> give<00:04:11.120> me<00:04:12.190> they<00:04:13.190> can

problems<00:04:16.820> now<00:04:17.890> through<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.010> microscope<00:04:19.520> I'm

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
problems now through the microscope I'm

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.120 
problems now through the microscope I'm
able<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:21.100> division<00:04:22.100> all<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.670> detail<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:24.130> it's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
able to division all the detail and it's

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.550 
able to division all the detail and it's
very<00:04:25.430> important<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.060> all<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.600> area<00:04:27.080> which

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.069 

I<00:04:48.089> had<00:04:48.749> gone<00:04:49.289> over<00:04:49.559> this<00:04:49.860> already<00:04:50.629> but<00:04:51.629> now<00:04:51.869> i'm

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:52.079 
I had gone over this already but now i'm

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.629 
I had gone over this already but now i'm
using<00:04:52.559> a<00:04:52.709> less<00:04:53.069> coarse<00:04:53.489> birth<00:04:55.129> to<00:04:56.129> get<00:04:56.309> the<00:04:56.429> job

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
using a less coarse birth to get the job

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.839 
using a less coarse birth to get the job
done<00:04:57.049> now<00:04:58.049> that's<00:04:58.409> it

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.260 

very<00:06:27.380> well<00:06:29.800> now<00:06:30.800> this<00:06:31.190> case<00:06:31.490> will<00:06:31.730> be<00:06:31.760> glazed

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
very well now this case will be glazed

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.030 
very well now this case will be glazed
up<00:06:35.140> separately<00:06:36.140> from<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.590> other<00:06:36.710> shoes

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
up separately from the other shoes

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.210 
up separately from the other shoes
because<00:06:37.460> it<00:06:37.610> has<00:06:37.730> a<00:06:37.760> different<00:06:38.330> texture<00:06:39.220> that

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
because it has a different texture that

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.590 
because it has a different texture that
needs<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.670> be<00:06:40.820> respected<00:06:41.090> by<00:06:41.870> prescription<00:06:43.600> so

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
needs to be respected by prescription so

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.530 
needs to be respected by prescription so
that's<00:06:45.080> it
