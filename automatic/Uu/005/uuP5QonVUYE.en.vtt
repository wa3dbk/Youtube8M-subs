 famous and emblematic of the world the empire

 did to raise awareness about one of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.609
 the biggest problems facing the

 animals that today are in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.800
 danger of extinction were projected 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.800
 on the facade 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810

 commemorate the 4th of July or pride 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 gates the truth is that when the empire 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 state building fills with new color 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 york and the world become aware of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.970
 some event and this time it was the turn of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
 the animals those who are in 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.420
 danger of extinction to be more 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 Exact gigantic projections 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.870
 they illuminated the south facade of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 emblematic building to promote the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.250
 early departure of the documentary racing 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.019
 extension of the movie follows a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 group of activists that expose the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.219
 dangers of poaching cruelty 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 of the black market of animals and makes a 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.930
 strong call for attention to the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 imminent destruction of our habitat 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.619
 my paleontologist friends say that the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.780
 Second World War will be an anecdote 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.630
 compared to everything that is to come 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 which is that a species is to say we 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.850
 we are causing a massive loss of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.860
 biodiversity we hope that this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 event tonight celebrate the life of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.899
 these animals and give them a chance 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.729
 the face of the cecyl lion that was 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.560
 beheaded in zimbabwe last week 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.190
 for his American tourist too 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.500
 filled the facade of man 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.820
 the event sparked a worldwide wave of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.440
 indignation and seems to have been 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 stuck in the minds of the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.730
 Americans, I think it's a message 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.860
 wonderful to take out there 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.360
 especially after the events of the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.520
 last week they had me very 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.900
 angry about what happened with the lion I think 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850
 that the world needs to become aware 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.860
 how fragile the animals are and how 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.600
 how abusive is humanity with them 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.070
 it was a show without a doubt 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.290
 impressive but it was first of all 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.510
 conceived by its creators as a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.220
 Mass education tool 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.480
 reid in extension the premiere will be 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.480
