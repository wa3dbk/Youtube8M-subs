00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
muscle working the third position that I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.860 
muscle working the third position that I
use<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> bend<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.160> knee<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.730> push<00:02:19.599> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
use is a bend in the knee and push the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.890 
use is a bend in the knee and push the
yield<00:02:20.110> back<00:02:20.470> behind<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.209> though<00:02:22.720> you're

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
yield back behind you as though you're

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
yield back behind you as though you're
pushing<00:02:23.260> toward<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> back<00:02:23.920> wall<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:25.330> way

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
pushing toward the back wall this way

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.660 
pushing toward the back wall this way
again<00:02:25.720> you're<00:02:26.140> hitting<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.590> gluteal<00:02:27.099> area<00:02:27.250> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
again you're hitting that gluteal area a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.250 
again you're hitting that gluteal area a
little<00:02:27.970> bit<00:02:28.120> differently<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.989> we're<00:02:29.110> taking

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
little bit differently so we're taking

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.430 
little bit differently so we're taking
three<00:02:29.769> different<00:02:30.190> positions<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.440> working

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
three different positions and working

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.490 
three different positions and working
the<00:02:32.739> muscle<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:34.450> course<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:34.900> recommend<00:02:35.410> that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500
