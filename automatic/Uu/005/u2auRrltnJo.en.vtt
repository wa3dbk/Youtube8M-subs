00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 Welcome to Motocard.com 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.730
 The Shark Race-R Pro is the most sporting and approved helmet 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 for the competition of the French brand. 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.490
 Not in vain is a helmet used by top riders of motorcycling as 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.529
 they are Aleix Espargaró, Scott Redding or Tom Sykes. 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.149
 Here on the table we have a variant of this family, which is the 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.939
 Shark Race-R Pro Carbon version, 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.829
 which, as you can see, has a greater presence of carbon in its structure 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.789
 Exterior. 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.740
 If we start by analyzing the external structure of the helmet, we realize that 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.040
 the only difference between the Shark Race R Pro and the Shark Race R Pro Carbon, 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.940
 what we have here, is 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.530
 the latter, the Carbon, has a greater presence, has a greater 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.770
 presence of carbon, in its external structure. 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.390
 For the rest, the structure of the shell is exactly the same, it's 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.730
 say, that the helmet keeps the multi-axial structure of the brand, 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.170
 which combines the materials, carbon fiber with the aramid fiber and the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.420
 fiberglass together with resins of the Shark brand. 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.119
 That said, the first thing we notice when we have the helmet on 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.630
 hands is that very little that is very light, 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 This helmet only weighs 1250gr. approximately in size M. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.240
 As for the aerodynamics of the Shark Race-R Pro we see that the helmet 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 incorporates 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.869
 a double-leaf spoiler on the back, and that has been designed to 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 offer the necessary stability and aerodynamics at high 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.210
 speeds. 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.750
 If we go now helmet ventilation system, this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.540
 It consists of four main entrances: one located in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.550
 front of the shell, two others located at the top of the shell, and a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.710
 Last, what is this, we found the helmet chin guard. Both have 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.499
 some systems, some mechanisms of accionamiento, 'on / off' of two positions. 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:15.370
 The screen of the Shark Race-R Pro is called VZ100. It is a thick screen 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.030
 variables, that is, on the sides of the screen we find a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.000
 thickness of 2.8mm while in the central area we find a 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 thickness of 4.25mm. This variable thickness prevents 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.070
 a distortion of the image when we are going, 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.330
 and also gives the screen greater resistance to eventual 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.429
 stone impacts. 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:44.359
 This screen has anti-fog treatment on the inside, has treatment 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.269
 anti-scratch on the outside, 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.480
 and the mechanism 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.529
 from the screen 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.249
 allows us to extract it thanks to these cams that we find 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.689
 to the side and side of the screen mechanism 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.979
 allows us to extract this screen easily, quickly and without 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:00.720
 need 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.989
 of tools. 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.669
 On the other hand, 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.439
 the helmet has a rubber crown 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.120
 in the perimeter zone of the vision hole that guarantees 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.169
 a correct isolation 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.279
 from the screen 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.909
 and this closure guarantees that the screen can not be opened 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.139
 in an accident way. 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.959
 As for the interior of the hull we found some foam 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.819
 thermoformed inside that have anti-allergic treatment are 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.650
 Removable and are washable. 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 Yes it is true that we have not found microperforated areas 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.529
 as sports helmets usually have, 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.810
 but the Shark Race-R Pro solves it 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.720
 with an optimal ventilation system, that is, the flow of 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.310
 air 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.589
 inside it is secure. 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.429
 We also have to base 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.390
 of the padding is made of neoprene, 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.679
 a material 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.449
 that will offer us the necessary elasticity 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.890
 in this area of ​​the padding but also avoid 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.419
 and will offer greater resistance to water entry 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.239
 than other helmets. It should also be noted that the foams 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.999
 in the cheek area are adjustable and that the system 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:24.769
 It was adapted for users who wear glasses thanks to the system 

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.809
 'Easy fit' by Shark. 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:31.120
 Other highlights of the Shark Race-R Pro 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.760
 is the closure system, which is the double buckle, the only one admitted in competition, 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.819
 with the particularity that the belt's finish is magnetic. 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.679
 More things than the Shark Race-R Pro as standard: 

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:46.680
 the breathing baffle 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.699
 or cover, 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.229
 as well as 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.590
 the cover plate with an adjustment system that also comes as standard. 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.449
 And to my right 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.819
 we have the Shark Race-R Pro that Tom Sykes uses in the Championship of 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.089
 World of Superbikes. As you can see, these graphs do not 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.839
 sold in the Shark Race-R Pro, so we can assure you that this 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.020
 is the helmet that uses 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.259
 Tom Sykes in competition. 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.800
 And we put it here to make a comparison and to show you 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.620
 what are the differences 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.949
 between one and another. 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.830
 And the differences are 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.110
 null or very few, 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.439
 in fact Tom Sykes is only fit 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:33.020
 personally, the inner padding of the helmet is personalized. 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.090
 The rest of materials, of components, between a helmet and another one 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.659
 they change in nothing. 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.009
