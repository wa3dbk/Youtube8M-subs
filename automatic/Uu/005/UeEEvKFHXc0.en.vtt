just<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.730> it's<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.120> pop<00:05:49.390> of<00:05:49.540> color<00:05:49.840> yet<00:05:50.500> it

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
just because it's a pop of color yet it

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.590 
just because it's a pop of color yet it
isn't<00:05:50.860> too<00:05:51.640> overwhelming

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:02.129 

and<00:05:55.600> we<00:05:56.199> are<00:05:56.410> finished<00:05:59.220> all<00:06:00.220> right<00:06:00.610> so<00:06:01.150> now

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
and we are finished all right so now

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.719 
and we are finished all right so now
that<00:06:02.380> I<00:06:02.410> have<00:06:02.500> finished<00:06:02.830> my<00:06:03.100> book<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.669> have

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
that I have finished my book and have

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.950 
that I have finished my book and have
used<00:06:04.389> this<00:06:04.900> I<00:06:05.699> want<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.760> lace<00:06:07.060> palette<00:06:07.690> for<00:06:07.840> the

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
used this I want to lace palette for the

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.710 
used this I want to lace palette for the
first<00:06:08.260> time<00:06:08.560> I<00:06:08.949> am<00:06:09.580> absolutely<00:06:10.150> in<00:06:10.360> love<00:06:10.389> with

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
first time I am absolutely in love with

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.409 
first time I am absolutely in love with
it<00:06:11.050> i<00:06:11.110> think<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.770> pigmentation<00:06:12.280> is<00:06:12.580> right<00:06:13.060> and

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
it i think the pigmentation is right and

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.409 
it i think the pigmentation is right and
as<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:14.080> can<00:06:14.260> see<00:06:14.290> using<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.669> pop<00:06:15.970> of<00:06:16.150> color

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
as you can see using a pop of color

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.330 
as you can see using a pop of color
underneath<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.380> shadowed<00:06:17.740> definitely

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
underneath and I shadowed definitely

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.550 
underneath and I shadowed definitely
makes<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.610> difference<00:06:18.940> for<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.750> end<00:06:19.930> result

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
makes a difference for the end result

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.280 
makes a difference for the end result
sometimes<00:06:21.430> with<00:06:21.790> skins<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.510> are<00:06:22.750> warmer

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
sometimes with skins that are warmer

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.670 
sometimes with skins that are warmer
it's<00:06:23.530> harder<00:06:23.949> for<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.580> see<00:06:24.970> the<00:06:25.680> cranberry

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
it's harder for you to see the cranberry

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.100 
it's harder for you to see the cranberry
colors<00:06:27.130> or<00:06:27.699> any<00:06:27.910> kind<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.300> has<00:06:28.419> an<00:06:28.600> undertone

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
colors or any kind that has an undertone

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.560 
colors or any kind that has an undertone
so<00:06:29.650> wearing<00:06:30.039> a<00:06:30.160> color<00:06:30.430> underneath<00:06:30.789> really

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
so wearing a color underneath really

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.939 
so wearing a color underneath really
makes<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:32.020> difference<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.470> I<00:06:32.530> think<00:06:32.800> it's

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
makes a difference and I think it's

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.159 
makes a difference and I think it's
great<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.910> play<00:06:34.060> around<00:06:34.270> with<00:06:34.600> colors<00:06:34.960> when

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
great to play around with colors when

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.920 
great to play around with colors when
you<00:06:35.260> have<00:06:35.560> a<00:06:35.590> palette<00:06:36.310> that<00:06:36.490> has<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:37.360> many

you have a palette that has so many

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.580 
you have a palette that has so many
colors<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:39.990> consistency<00:06:40.990> is<00:06:41.110> great<00:06:41.380> I<00:06:41.560> really

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590

colors<00:06:46.660> in<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.900> world<00:06:47.199> compared<00:06:48.130> to<00:06:48.310> just

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
colors in the world compared to just

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.330 
colors in the world compared to just
buying<00:06:48.880> separate<00:06:49.539> I<00:06:49.720> shadows<00:06:50.380> from<00:06:50.949> other

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
buying separate I shadows from other

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.810 
buying separate I shadows from other
companies<00:06:52.470> I'm<00:06:53.470> really<00:06:53.800> happy<00:06:54.070> with<00:06:54.340> this<00:06:54.520> and
