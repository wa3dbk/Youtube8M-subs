00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
global system so far so far it feels

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.950 
global system so far so far it feels
like<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.110> last<00:01:18.530> five<00:01:18.980> are<00:01:19.220> not<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.420> cyclic

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
like a last five are not on cyclic

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.420 
like a last five are not on cyclic
cyclic<00:01:21.670> feels<00:01:22.670> very<00:01:22.970> light<00:01:23.180> very<00:01:23.770> predictable

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
cyclic feels very light very predictable

cyclic feels very light very predictable
it<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.450> mighty<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.620> like<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.980> fly<00:01:28.220> bar

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
Kelly at the instant response but it

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.090 
Kelly at the instant response but it
doesn't<00:01:32.150> speed<00:01:32.960> up<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.260> slow<00:01:33.320> down<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:34.040> you
