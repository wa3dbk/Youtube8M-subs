it's always nice and you know it's been
two<00:00:04.529> amazing<00:00:05.009> weeks<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.240> travel<00:00:06.569> was<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
two amazing weeks and the travel was a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.900 
two amazing weeks and the travel was a
little<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.140> tough<00:00:07.290> maybe<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.040> time

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
little bit tough maybe with that time

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.879 
little bit tough maybe with that time
difference<00:00:09.330> but<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.500> know<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.650> not

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
difference but it's you know it's not

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.140 
difference but it's you know it's not
something<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> think<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> be

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
something that I think it's going to be

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.930 
something that I think it's going to be
an<00:00:12.269> issue<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.219> we're<00:00:14.219> fine<00:00:14.460> getting<00:00:14.700> there

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
an issue and we're fine getting there

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
an issue and we're fine getting there
and<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.269> always<00:00:15.540> easier<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.809> come<00:00:16.049> out<00:00:16.199> right

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
and it's always easier to come out right

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
and it's always easier to come out right
down<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> golden<00:00:19.039> understand<00:00:20.869> they<00:00:21.869> play

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
down the golden understand they play

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
down the golden understand they play
better<00:00:22.410> than<00:00:22.500> us<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.250> think<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.640> were

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
better than us I think I think we were

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
better than us I think I think we were
we<00:00:24.269> were<00:00:24.359> playing<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.230> first

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
we were playing well in the in the first

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.630 
we were playing well in the in the first
period<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:25.980> got<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> couple<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> chances

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
period and we got a couple of chances

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.419 
period and we got a couple of chances
and<00:00:27.590> you<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.099> got<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and you know if we would have got the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
and you know if we would have got the
first<00:00:29.640> goal<00:00:29.730> maybe<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.390> been

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
first goal maybe it would have been

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
first goal maybe it would have been
different<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.960> felt<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.070> yeah<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.399> know
