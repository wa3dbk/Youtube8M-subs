is<00:00:17.350> Jeff<00:00:17.650> a<00:00:17.710> decent<00:00:18.039> Rockstar<00:00:18.400> calm<00:00:18.820> today<00:00:19.060> I'm

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
is Jeff a decent Rockstar calm today I'm

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.700 
is Jeff a decent Rockstar calm today I'm
going<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.390> teach<00:00:19.539> you<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.690> little<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.230> harmonic

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
going to teach you the little a harmonic

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.790 
going to teach you the little a harmonic
minor<00:00:20.920> ascending<00:00:21.490> run<00:00:21.670> so<00:00:22.030> let's<00:00:22.180> have<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.330> look

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
minor ascending run so let's have a look

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.020 
minor ascending run so let's have a look
okay<00:00:23.800> I'm<00:00:23.980> not<00:00:24.070> going<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.310> over<00:00:24.520> explain<00:00:24.880> this

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
okay I'm not going to over explain this

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.180 
okay I'm not going to over explain this
too<00:00:25.270> much<00:00:25.450> it's<00:00:26.200> played<00:00:26.470> in<00:00:26.620> the<00:00:26.680> key<00:00:26.860> of<00:00:26.890> a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
too much it's played in the key of a

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:35.220 
too much it's played in the key of a
harmonic<00:00:27.550> minor<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.570> pattern<00:00:34.899> itself

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
harmonic minor so and the pattern itself

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.869 
harmonic minor so and the pattern itself
starts<00:00:35.680> on<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> seventh<00:00:36.309> note<00:00:36.520> of<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.760> scale

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
starts on the seventh note of the scale

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:44.450 
starts on the seventh note of the scale
so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.290 

and<00:00:45.460> then<00:00:45.579> I<00:00:45.610> go<00:00:45.850> up<00:00:45.879> an<00:00:46.149> octave

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.150 

another<00:00:54.300> octave<00:00:57.470> you<00:01:00.500> can<00:01:01.500> ended<00:01:01.770> however<00:01:01.950> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
another octave you can ended however you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:12.080 
another octave you can ended however you
want<00:01:06.230> like<00:01:07.230> that<00:01:07.730> something<00:01:08.730> English<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
want like that something English the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
want like that something English the
picking<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.050> pretty<00:01:13.740> efficient

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
picking on this is pretty efficient

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
picking on this is pretty efficient
picking<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:15.170> let<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.260> move<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
picking actually let me just move the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.850 
picking actually let me just move the
camera<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:19.710> actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
camera a little bit so we're actually

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
camera a little bit so we're actually
starting<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> Down<00:01:20.820> stroke<00:01:21.210> play<00:01:21.510> through

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
starting on a Down stroke play through

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.249 
starting on a Down stroke play through
the<00:01:21.960> 16<00:01:22.380> note<00:01:22.619> pattern

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.029 

upstroke<00:01:29.259> then<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.490> next<00:01:30.640> section

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.190 

upstroke<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.880> last<00:01:38.119> one<00:01:38.390> again<00:01:38.630> starting<00:01:39.140> on

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
upstroke the last one again starting on

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.569 
upstroke the last one again starting on
downstroke<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:43.689> on<00:01:44.689> an<00:01:44.810> upslope<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:45.979> it's

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
downstroke and on an upslope so it's

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.760 
downstroke and on an upslope so it's
pretty<00:01:46.729> efficient<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.750> don't<00:01:47.869> always<00:01:48.380> play

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
pretty efficient now I don't always play

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.179 
pretty efficient now I don't always play
it<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:48.979> that

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
it like that

00:01:49.189 --> 00:02:08.289 
it like that
I<00:01:49.460> actually<00:01:50.329> prefer<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:51.079> play<00:01:51.259> it<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
I actually prefer to play it and the

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.940 
I actually prefer to play it and the
reason<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.660> do<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.349> personal

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
reason I do that it's just personal

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.759 
reason I do that it's just personal
choice<00:02:10.160> but<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:11.239> just<00:02:11.660> feel<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
choice but I just feel that it's a

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.080 
choice but I just feel that it's a
little<00:02:13.010> bit<00:02:13.130> less<00:02:13.340> mechanical<00:02:13.549> sounding

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
little bit less mechanical sounding

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.640 
little bit less mechanical sounding
that's<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.360> kind<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.690> rigid<00:02:17.840> right<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.500> get

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
that's just kind of rigid right you get

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.620 
that's just kind of rigid right you get
a<00:02:18.680> little<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.160> swing<00:02:19.519> in<00:02:19.670> there<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.599> a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
a little bit of a swing in there to do a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:35.229 
a little bit of a swing in there to do a
hammer

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.270 

so<00:02:36.239> I'm<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.900> sure<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.110> would<00:02:37.379> really<00:02:37.920> rely<00:02:38.250> on

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so I'm not sure I would really rely on

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.960 
so I'm not sure I would really rely on
my<00:02:38.610> picking<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.360> through<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.920> anyway

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
my picking to go through that anyway

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.490 
my picking to go through that anyway
hope<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> liked<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.360> lesson<00:02:42.510> check<00:02:43.379> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
hope you liked the lesson check the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.030 
hope you liked the lesson check the
