00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and that people is what so anything with

and that people is what so anything with
the<00:01:47.280> PlayStation<00:01:47.790> 4<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> Sony<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.710> adopting

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

x86 program in architecture which is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.670 
x86 program in architecture which is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
now you're gonna have a machine pretty

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389 
now you're gonna have a machine pretty
