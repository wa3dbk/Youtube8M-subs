 August ap 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.999
 modern laszlo jass 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.850
 to battle players three to four times per session the rules of 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.989
 base even though the extensions are 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.609
 particularly 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.630
 simple 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 and affordable once you start and play you can see very quickly 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.560
 shouted a tactical and strategic depth that make it one of the games the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960
 most popular at the moment 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.499
 the there 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 instantly become a classic 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.410
 for an hour and a half it's not on a modular tray they are 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 land in the form of a hexagon that one places the leader of the party which 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.100
 allows 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.980
 one of the different fantastic creatures and these subscriptions are in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.230
 makes resources we're going to be upset and we'll be rich in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.050
 various raw material that make up the game and that will allow 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 quickly to be able to know what the strengths are and 37% on its 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 community its settlements its villages 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
 the second part so that his son was exciting 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 c from the moment the players exchange the material gap 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.910
 first then the interested long term strategic plan it's 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.550
 to realize that 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.370
 you have to be hungry two or three moves forward on the opponents 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
 because the most difficult thing is finally to separate from certain 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.690
 resources that can be used after the fact 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.730
 to become others that is to say that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.460
 some players we take a lot of goals 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.250
 must inevitably agree by trading wheat account 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 minerals in order to optimize their land 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 and finally made up for their lack in raw materials and that's 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.070
 necessarily the one with the most colonies 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 who will win the game 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.860
 but really the interest of this game is it starts very quickly and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.660
 relevant 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.540
 we do not need to be very late to play the parties are not 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.320
 taken at that time a year ago it's really a very nice job on 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.380
 the project itself is not just an interesting game these images get 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.600
 enjoy the buzz and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.340
 the strategic dimension 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.830
 do we really want to this parcel of catania
