the bait pop off the back put a little
peanut<00:00:40.730> butter<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.239> there<00:00:41.649> put<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.739> back<00:00:42.949> on

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
peanut butter in there put it back on

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.360 
peanut butter in there put it back on
and<00:00:43.690> mouse<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:45.199> supposed<00:00:45.589> to<00:00:45.769> smell<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
and mouse is supposed to smell the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.240 
and mouse is supposed to smell the
peanut<00:00:46.579> butter<00:00:47.050> come<00:00:48.050> up<00:00:48.230> through<00:00:48.859> the<00:00:49.039> door

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
peanut butter come up through the door

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.069 
peanut butter come up through the door
and<00:00:49.609> into<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.030> part<00:00:50.329> where<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:50.660> tilted

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
and into this part where it's tilted

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.869 
and into this part where it's tilted
right<00:00:51.260> here<00:00:51.469> when<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.649> gets<00:00:51.890> up<00:00:52.039> there<00:00:52.070> trap

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
right here when it gets up there trap

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.900 
right here when it gets up there trap
it's<00:00:53.059> off<00:00:53.210> balance<00:00:53.449> which<00:00:53.899> causes<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.649> to

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
it's off balance which causes it to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.599 
it's off balance which causes it to
close<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.929> latches<00:00:57.440> again<00:00:57.739> Mouse<00:00:58.309> is

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
close and this latches again Mouse is

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.849 
close and this latches again Mouse is
theoretically<00:00:59.570> at<00:00:59.780> least<00:00:59.809> stuck<00:01:00.440> in<00:01:00.620> there

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
theoretically at least stuck in there

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.889 
theoretically at least stuck in there
they<00:01:01.670> really<00:01:01.879> thought<00:01:02.059> of<00:01:02.120> just<00:01:02.690> about

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
they really thought of just about

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.000 
they really thought of just about
everything<00:01:03.140> like<00:01:03.440> they<00:01:03.559> even<00:01:03.679> put<00:01:03.980> some

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
everything like they even put some

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.490 
everything like they even put some
little<00:01:04.460> air<00:01:04.760> holes<00:01:04.790> over<00:01:05.570> here<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:06.080> this<00:01:06.230> side

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
little air holes over here on this side

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.310 
little air holes over here on this side
so<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.400> mouse<00:01:07.930> hopefully<00:01:08.930> while<00:01:09.110> it's

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
so that the mouse hopefully while it's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.490 
so that the mouse hopefully while it's
stuck<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.920> there<00:01:10.100> won't<00:01:10.520> won't<00:01:11.150> suffocate<00:01:11.660> but

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
stuck in there won't won't suffocate but

looks<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:53.420> trap<00:02:53.750> not<00:02:54.170> only<00:02:54.530> works<00:02:54.770> but

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
looks like this trap not only works but

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.150 
looks like this trap not only works but
it<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:55.580> extremely<00:02:56.240> effective<00:02:57.040> doesn't<00:02:58.040> hurt

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
it is extremely effective doesn't hurt

it is extremely effective doesn't hurt
the<00:02:58.310> mouse<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.540> my<00:02:59.750> opinion<00:02:59.810> actually

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the mouse and in my opinion actually

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.250 
the mouse and in my opinion actually
works<00:03:01.100> better<00:03:01.400> than<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.330> traditional<00:03:02.750> mouse

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
works better than a traditional mouse

works better than a traditional mouse

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
trap because with the traditional mouse

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.970 
trap because with the traditional mouse

there's actually no way that this can
