divide it into two sections they're
almost<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.050> equal<00:00:22.380> halves<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> top

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
almost in equal halves but the top

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.579 
almost in equal halves but the top
section<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.179> little<00:00:24.509> bit<00:00:24.660> fuller<00:00:25.169> than

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
section is just a little bit fuller than

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.650 
section is just a little bit fuller than
the<00:00:25.710> bottom<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.249> like<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> leave<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.269> bottom

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the bottom I like to leave my bottom

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.089 
the bottom I like to leave my bottom
nice<00:00:27.839> and<00:00:28.169> thick<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.589> you<00:00:28.800> don't<00:00:28.980> get

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
nice and thick so that you don't get

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.859 
nice and thick so that you don't get
that<00:00:29.279> last<00:00:29.519> layer<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.419> fine<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that last layer that is just so fine it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.470 
that last layer that is just so fine it
doesn't<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.259> good<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.700> then<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.300> and

whatever<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> also<00:00:36.420> another<00:00:36.810> way<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
whatever there is also another way to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
whatever there is also another way to
layer<00:00:37.320> we've<00:00:37.710> made<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.160> video<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:39.060> pull

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
layer we've made that video to can pull

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
layer we've made that video to can pull
it<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> sides<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.440> cut<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.859> but

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it out on the sides and cut it up but

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
it out on the sides and cut it up but
this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> different<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:43.140> people<00:00:43.289> also

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this is a different way some people also

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.330 
this is a different way some people also
do<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> their<00:00:44.340> hair<00:00:44.489> upside<00:00:44.969> down<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:47.190> then

it<00:01:27.930> more<00:01:28.229> times<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:28.890> dividing<00:01:29.640> hers<00:01:30.409> so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it more times than I'm dividing hers so

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.950 
it more times than I'm dividing hers so
take<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.829> extra<00:01:32.100> layer<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.600> measuring

the<00:01:46.649> ridge<00:01:46.829> from<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> previous<00:01:47.640> trim<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the ridge from the previous trim and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
the ridge from the previous trim and
then<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.170> following<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.740> Ridge<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
then I'm following that Ridge and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
then I'm following that Ridge and
cutting<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> hair<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> exact<00:01:52.049> length<00:01:52.289> as

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
cutting this hair to the exact length as

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
cutting this hair to the exact length as
that<00:01:52.710> other<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.100> sorry<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.329> slightly<00:01:54.570> out

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that other one sorry it's slightly out

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
that other one sorry it's slightly out
of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> camera<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> followed<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of the camera but I followed the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
of the camera but I followed the
previous<00:01:56.250> line<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.710> let<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> out<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.200> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
previous line then I let it out and it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.380 
previous line then I let it out and it
is<00:02:01.350> super<00:02:01.799> super<00:02:02.399> easy<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:03.240> you're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
is super super easy because you're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
is super super easy because you're
already<00:02:03.570> done<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.649> she<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> big

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
already done and now she has that big

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
already done and now she has that big
variation<00:02:06.240> about<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.719> far<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
variation about that far up and then you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.820 
variation about that far up and then you
can<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.829> some<00:02:08.039> more<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:08.970> lower<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
can see some more a little bit lower and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.930 
can see some more a little bit lower and
again<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.100> want<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.460> layers<00:02:11.670> more

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
again if you want your layers more

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.270 
again if you want your layers more
drastic<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.720> cut<00:02:12.990> more<00:02:13.200> sections<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.010> take

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
drastic then cut more sections and take

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.730 
drastic then cut more sections and take
off<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.730> than<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> four<00:02:15.210> inches<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> did

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
off more than the four inches that I did

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.580 
off more than the four inches that I did
I<00:02:17.120> also<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.600> way<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.930> myself<00:02:19.290> because

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
I also do it this way on myself because

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
I also do it this way on myself because
it's<00:02:19.740> easy<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.130> reach<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.520> my<00:02:20.670> hair<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.120> upside

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
it's easy to reach if my hair is upside

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.370 
it's easy to reach if my hair is upside
down

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.440
