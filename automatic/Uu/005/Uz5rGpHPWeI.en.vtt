good

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
good
that's<00:00:17.880> why<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.090> worst<00:00:18.359> part<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> trip

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that's why the worst part of the trip

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.920 
that's why the worst part of the trip
I'm<00:00:19.980> waiting<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.670> surgery<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.750> because

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I'm waiting to get surgery just because

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
I'm waiting to get surgery just because
it<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.310> feel<00:00:23.550> every<00:00:23.850> bone<00:00:24.029> moving

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it was so you feel every bone moving

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.970 
it was so you feel every bone moving
around<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.609> it's<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.539> crazy

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
around in there it's really really crazy

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.849 
around in there it's really really crazy
but<00:00:29.119> after<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> surgery<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:31.320> wasn't<00:00:31.679> allowed

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
but after the surgery it wasn't allowed

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.420 
but after the surgery it wasn't allowed
as<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.340> understand<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.920> anyway<00:00:34.920> even<00:00:35.160> my

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
as I understand into my anyway even my

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.830 
as I understand into my anyway even my
tongue<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.690> ground<00:00:38.090> if<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.239> did<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> had

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
tongue like on the ground if I did I had

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
tongue like on the ground if I did I had
the<00:00:40.020> possibility<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.620> reesh<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> during<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the possibility of reesh a during it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819 
the possibility of reesh a during it
because<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> surgery<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> did<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.590> very

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
because the surgery that we did was very

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.720 
because the surgery that we did was very
untypical<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.329> leg<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> type

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
untypical for a leg it was our this type

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.420 
untypical for a leg it was our this type
of<00:00:47.760> injury<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.629> required<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> rot<00:00:49.800> or

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
of injury really required like a rot or

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.560 
of injury really required like a rot or
they<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.969> cut<00:00:51.149> my<00:00:51.239> knee<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they would have had to cut my knee and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
they would have had to cut my knee and
hammer<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> rod<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.559> tibia<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hammer the rod into my tibia and it was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
hammer the rod into my tibia and it was
like<00:00:53.899> afraid<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> I'd<00:00:55.140> never<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.530> able<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like afraid that I'd never be able to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.590 
like afraid that I'd never be able to
stay<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.960> contributed<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:59.600> success

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
stay in but they contributed my success

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
stay in but they contributed my success
to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> doctor<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.859> did<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.699> surgery

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to the doctor that did the surgery

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
to the doctor that did the surgery
because<00:01:03.570> she<00:01:03.780> made<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.140> ankle<00:01:04.500> alignment

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because she made my ankle alignment

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.600 
because she made my ankle alignment
perfect<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:06.150> had<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.619> not<00:01:07.619> perfect<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.460> would

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
perfect which had it not perfect I would

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.679 
perfect which had it not perfect I would
have<00:01:08.729> always<00:01:08.939> had<00:01:09.240> instability<00:01:09.840> made<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:11.689> we

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
have always had instability made and we

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.470 
have always had instability made and we
did<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> surgery<00:01:13.500> with

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
did the surgery with

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.370 
did the surgery with
screws<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.830> my<00:01:18.860> cartilage<00:01:19.370> as<00:01:19.550> well<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.390> it

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
screws in my cartilage as well and it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.440 
screws in my cartilage as well and it
was<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> more<00:01:21.830> risky<00:01:22.040> surgery<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.940> required<00:01:23.330> a

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
was a more risky surgery that required a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.180 
was a more risky surgery that required a
little<00:01:23.570> bit<00:01:23.810> more<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:25.130> little<00:01:25.840> bit<00:01:26.840> more

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
little bit more a little bit more

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
little bit more a little bit more
non-weight-bearing<00:01:28.190> I<00:01:28.640> kinda<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.090> is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
non-weight-bearing I kinda this is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.670 
non-weight-bearing I kinda this is
broken<00:01:29.360> my<00:01:29.630> leg<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:30.110> would<00:01:30.290> have<00:01:30.380> been<00:01:30.470> able<00:01:30.530> to

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
broken my leg I would have been able to

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.500 
broken my leg I would have been able to
go<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.100> pool<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.610> maintain<00:01:32.360> my

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
go in the pool and maintain my

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.270 
go in the pool and maintain my
conditioning<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.560> would<00:01:33.890> have<00:01:33.980> been<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:34.250> my

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
conditioning and I would have been on my

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.310 
conditioning and I would have been on my
sled<00:01:34.700> or<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.060> had<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.360> rod<00:01:35.870> I<00:01:35.900> would<00:01:36.230> have

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
sled or if I had the rod I would have

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.020 
sled or if I had the rod I would have
been<00:01:36.410> able<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.620> at<00:01:36.830> least<00:01:36.860> walk<00:01:37.250> around<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
been able to at least walk around a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.870 
been able to at least walk around a
little<00:01:38.660> bit<00:01:38.780> sooner<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.890> had<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.580> kind<00:01:40.760> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
little bit sooner so I had to kind of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.760 
little bit sooner so I had to kind of
take<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> risk<00:01:41.390> there<00:01:41.690> but<00:01:42.020> what<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
take the risk there but what the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.320 
take the risk there but what the
intention<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.580> know<00:01:43.670> when<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.940> was<00:01:44.090> done

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
intention of you know when it was done

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.220 
intention of you know when it was done
and<00:01:44.600> healed<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.740> could<00:01:46.160> just<00:01:46.370> never<00:01:47.180> know<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.140> as

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
and healed I could just never know so as

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.600 
and healed I could just never know so as
soon<00:01:48.470> as<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.830> doctor<00:01:49.160> gave<00:01:49.280> me<00:01:49.400> permission

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610

I can't say that no I don't think I
think<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.670> rehabs<00:02:57.000> probably<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.570> be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
think that rehabs probably going to be

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.520 
think that rehabs probably going to be
another<00:02:57.870> few<00:02:58.170> years

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
another few years

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.090 
another few years
I<00:02:58.770> honestly<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> take<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> while

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
I honestly it's going to take a while

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.840 
I honestly it's going to take a while
but<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:03.390> feeling<00:03:03.540> pretty<00:03:03.750> good
