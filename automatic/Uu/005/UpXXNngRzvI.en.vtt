00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 leave that good thing I here is a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 I spend a lot because I do not have 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.840

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.750
 Even though I'm giving it to you like this, 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.729
 It's already giving me how to win. 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 but there will be new events there that you 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
 may be coming in from the use side 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.420
 that usage will be gaining is also 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.250
 that business is the game nobody knows 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 who will win the can will lose 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.920
 good my tip here that I have do not know 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.110
 if you have seen here looking at the research nor 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.770
 I 'm here at position 239 here in the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.719
 position in the overall standings here and there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
 I do not attack much understood 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.060
 looks like you can see here you have book 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.340
 nor 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.069
 38 here which is more points than 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.739
 than me so the tip is this here 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.890
 as you can see here here 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.230
 the decorative item there gives 200 in order 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.020
 so it 's a nice help out there if 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.269
 you are between 100 and you can 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 Very good, I'll try, I do not know if I 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.260

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.250
 to win the decorative item and then let's 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.410
 There is not here that I'm going to give today. 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.590
 Ok let's get it here as you can. 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.090

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.620
 I already finished the event here, but we will 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 here on the side here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.049
 Good thing my tip is the following, right? 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.049
 for who does not have much commander there 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.870
 you should be getting there right oo 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.239
 and will be making available 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.910
 several commanders to you commander 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 but then anyone who has not been 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.440
 with his 12 with 12 normal commander 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.840
 same beauty 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.700
 the business is the next you there who 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.579
 is running after many points to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.609
 idea is going to lower to one like mine 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.389
 honor tannus and if you saw mine there 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.900
 today is there with 335 for who was 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:46.350
 with 1800 ac in some time ago then 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.970
 lowered general and will lower still is 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.239
 The next day I got is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.160
 next so you're going to try to attack 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.069
 the castles here 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.709
 the ones who have beaten their opponents and attacked 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.630
 does so does easy goal will lose the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.180
 Honor will lose one but you will win 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.910
 points which is the main places 13 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.579
 hailed on the left flank and 33 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.400
 miss out on the law and send your 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.430
 attack there you will gain a point there 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.430
 face would be more or less 1 100 attack 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.470
 by day if you come there 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.080
 sixty attack from 60 points per 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.140
 day then jael and a nice help 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.360
 The event has several days to 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.690
 then understood how to be 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.070
 getting more point in this event is 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 that's the way I said it 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.380
 take this way it will attack do not go in 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:44.310
 catch capture win this is not a mistake 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:46.830
 is 50 50 and 100 soldiers each capture more 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.730
 from there on by myself 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.560
 I did this is 100 out in capture 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.140
 The other day when I went in, I did not have 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.780
 no more captures the campus friend 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.420
 their help understood then does not compensate 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.660
 do the catch then the tip is better than 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.670
 I have here for you it's the following 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.210
 choose any member there will apply 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.340
 in the castle since attacking and 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.770
 puts only three soldiers on the flank 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.690
 left and three soldiers on the flank 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.240
 right and order your attack 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.430
 It does not have to be the good commander. 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 he has few soldiers there you go 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.170
 will win the point that is the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.360
 The main one for you is rising to the top 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.930
 you can do with several castle 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.480
 and only three soldiers will be what 26 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.390
 soldiers in our midst you come here more 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.010
 thousand soldiers in this event can then 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.390
 be doing the way I did here 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.390
 from the galley 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.630
 So the tip I got in that 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:50.670
 This is a beautiful mountain event. 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:52.530
 so it's the next the guy goes there put 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.600
 three soldiers on the left flank and three 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.580
 soldiers went straight and sent their 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.190
 commander's attack need not be that 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.800
 good thing does not need to put tool 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.590
 beauty only three soldiers - the bench 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.050
 itaÃº to the last country in more than 100 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.730
 attacks with the day that you will see as 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.910
 you will rise general and one day there was the 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.530
 I started yesterday and today I did not 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.880
 Nothing, not an attack that I lost enough. 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.160
 I miss the band 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.090
 catch how can you see that I 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.760
 always get 15 points there playing 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.050
 I'm not taking it, I'm just going to 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.000
