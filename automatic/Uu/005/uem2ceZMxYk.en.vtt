00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.689
 The worldâ€™s population is growing, 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:15.689
 By 2050, our food has doubled 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.010
 For this reason, we need genetic engineering, strong insecticides and fertilizers -- 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.860
 a lot of 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.000
 fertilizer. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.519
 This is what we do with all farmers every day and 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.810
 Their families are working together for the sake of their struggle. 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.770
 Don't you want to feed the world? 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.040
 Information like this seems to be everywhere. But who is really behind the scenes? 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.879
 It turns out that they are some companies that benefit from this farming method -- 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.770
 For example, companies that sell pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 They cost billions of dollars to warn us that their approach is the only way. 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.199
 The corporate groups that are in the same group as they are, such as the "For the Future Food Alliance", its subordinate members include 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.140
 'Covering and Sauce Association', 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 'National Frozen Pizza Institute'. 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 But ask the peasants who really know how to grow food and supply our food, and you will hear a very different story - 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.190
 It was a story I heard from hundreds of peasant families, a sad but hopeful story. 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.860
 Fifty years of mythology, plus the lobbying funds that support myths, 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.200
 Let farming land turn to fertilizer farming controlled by companies. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 Almost no support for farmers to take another path. 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.330
 So we can easily understand why farmers feel, 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.470
 Either these companies are 'on the same boat, or they just quit.' 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.380
 'On the same boat' means that the peasants no longer maintain the soil, 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 But instead planted a single crop; 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.550
 In the past, raising livestock on farmland was now crowded in dirty factories. 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.900
 In order to continue this unnatural system, these farmers are now investing in agricultural land. 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.869
 The cost is high, and the companies are getting more and more merged and the asking price is getting higher and higher. 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.270
 Farmland poisoning is addictive, it is very fast: 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.850
 Pests are resistant to insecticides, so you use chemical products much more; 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.490
 Livestock is more morbid, so you use drugs more 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 The land loses its natural fertility, so you apply more chemical fertilizer. 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 Then, on the other hand, when farmers sell their crops, 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.909
 They are only facing a few big buyers, and the bid is very difficult to predict. 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.199
 This kind of economy can't go on for long. 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:19.689
 For 50 years, desperate farmers have had to sign up with millions of companies. 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.900
 Let those companies give orders, and some farmers have completely lost their farmland. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.969
 Farmland income is increasingly concentrated in the top part, 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.189
 So now only one in ten American farmers can support a home. 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.340
 A similar situation exists in many other countries. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.749
 If a small farmer mistakenly believes in corporatized agriculture, it is the solution. 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.109
 Often caught in debt and dependent on the situation. 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.669
 Yes, corporate agriculture is good for some people -- 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.749
 Among them are some large growers -- 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.120
 But does not include typical farmers. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.969
 This is the first failure of this myth. 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.189
 But we still have to supply food and feed the world, right? 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.469
 If not, what choice do we have? 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.739
 We also have a great choice. 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.009
 However, we just can't see the advertisements for it, and of course we don't get subsidies. 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.839
 That is, the subsidies that big agricultural companies do not get. 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.169
 The most advanced sustainable farming methods quit the unnatural, chemical addictions mentioned above. 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.909
 It uses a better method and does not require more and more expensive purchases. 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.649
 Farmers who continue to cultivate cultivate healthy soils by planting different types of crops and carrying out rotation farming. 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.139
 They farm animals on the farm, not in a narrow factory. 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.969
 The way they fertilize is to use compost, livestock or plant crops that make the soil fertile. 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.390
 Healthy plants and good crop rotation can also help us control pests. 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.359
 Without harming the insects we need -- 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.919
 For example, insects that teach pollen are very important. 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.019
 So what is the impact of choosing this method on others? The impact is huge. 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.459
 Industrialized agricultural land erodes valuable soil tillage layers and reduces their grades -- 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.669
 Every year, in the center of the United States, 64 tons of soil is lost per acre. 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.109
 Farmland requires a lot of water -- many of which come from deep underground -- and the water basically disappears forever. 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.719
 Also, they use antibiotics in millions of pounds -- this approach brings new dangerous bacteria. 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.809
 They also produce toxic waste water that pollutes our rivers, oceans, and ourselves! 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.669
 Generally, Americans already have at least 13 insecticides in their bodies. 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.669
 Because of the use of chemicals in farmland, farmers and farmers are more likely to have multiple cancers than the average person. 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.479
 Well, sustainable agricultural land is more beneficial to farmers and the environment, but can it really feed the world? 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.360
 A research report says 'can do'! 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.819
 Sustainable agricultural land can produce as much as ..... even in the dry years of production. 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.439
 This news can be important for small farmers because they have planted 70% of the world's food -- 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.979
 To increase production, they don't need to take the path of the chemical. 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.739
 So what do we talk about in the future of food supply? Industrialized farms need more 

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.949
 Fossil fuels, water and excavated minerals -- 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.879
 These things are gradually exhausted and will only be expensive in the future. 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.150
 So at the end of the day, the road to that chemical is not only unreachable for farmers; 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.800
 It will not be an option at all in the future. 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.610
 The future of corporatized agriculture -- and even today -- cannot rely on it to produce more food. 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.039
 This is the second failure of that myth. 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.779
 But we still haven't seen the biggest loophole in this myth. 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.020
 They said that we must produce food in multiples, otherwise we will have to go hungry. Is that true? 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.490
 Everyone on earth, we have almost 3,000 hot card foods a day -- 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.039
 More than we need. 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.150
 And this figure is a waste of one-third of all the food we produce. 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.159
 Also, a lot of what is produced is not the food we eat directly. 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.100
 One third of the world's whole grains are used on livestock. 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.720
 In the United States, our biggest crop is corn, but the corn we eat is less than one percent of all the corn we grow. 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.979
 Most become fuel or feed. 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.409
 If we still take this old road, 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.909
 We can increase production, 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.249
 But we will be getting hungry. 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.559
 To end this phenomenon, everyone must be able to buy what they need or what they need. 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.719
 That is where all the essence of sustainable agricultural farming is. 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.249
 Here is the third failure of the dangerous myth, which shows that this myth is bad. 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.300
 So, the next time someone makes a frozen pizza -- or a toxic pesticide -- it tells you, 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.690
 There is only one way to supply food for the future, 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.789
 Then tell them: Their myths are full of loopholes. 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.120
 The evidence is clear: 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.799
 Farmers of sustainable production prove that all of us can enjoy healthy food -- 

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:06.379
 And each of us has the ability to do this. 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.499
 We can mobilize and control our own food money, and we can also call billions of dollars in public money. 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.239
 That is, the public money that is now flowing into the pockets of industrialized big agricultural companies. We can stand up, 

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.869
 Speaking to farmers around the world for sustainable production.
