00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.480
 Tell me guys, you put it here with a cart. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 to show you are following 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.210
 the DNA channel and for some time and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.539
 Most of these 700 and a few videos 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.490
 I saw practically everyone with affection 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:38.950
 to show or let's have it now 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:44.740
 This child is 98 legal way 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:47.140
 The whole new car is new car is only 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.170
 a model 98 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.360
 he is a car well cared for 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:02:07.619
 I got him from a single owner I am 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:02:07.619
 now his second owner and I think it's cool 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 from today 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.940
 on the safety part because the driver 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.069
 and passenger 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 his rear belts not only three 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.310
 points 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.310
 a little bit in that car 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.409
 So he in the column he does not have that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.670
 fixing the rear seat belt 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:03:03.379
 and the bank does not even have that rest 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:08.819
 central arm but good glasses 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:11.040
 electrical system of a lot of s 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.530
 totally under where you are 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:57.620
 want to give a steering column touch 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:57.620
 automatically adjustable 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:19.970
 I really like this type of car since 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:19.970
 I have a very good family. 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:46.600
 smile marshal car it has mirrors 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:48.430
 here I find it charming to ask everything 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.330
 entire panel perfect without any 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.250
 detail it has air cooling 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.840
 conditioning and also in the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:04.780
 the glove compartment 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:40.210
 electrical consoles not in the door 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:45.000
 your door control is the most 111 of the 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.000
 car on the back of it
