00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.399 
plants in about 30 days okay here are my
Tiny<00:01:19.830> Tim's<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> cloned<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:22.229> was

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
Tiny Tim's that I cloned and I was

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.070 
Tiny Tim's that I cloned and I was
worried<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:22.940> since<00:01:23.940> I<00:01:24.120> cloned<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
worried that since I cloned them from a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
worried that since I cloned them from a
mother<00:01:25.500> plant<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:26.820> already<00:01:27.030> gone

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
mother plant that had already gone

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.280 
mother plant that had already gone
through<00:01:27.830> its<00:01:29.060> flowering<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.450> fruiting<00:01:30.990> stage

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
through its flowering and fruiting stage

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.730 
through its flowering and fruiting stage
that<00:01:31.820> these<00:01:32.820> plants<00:01:33.270> might<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.659> flower<00:01:34.440> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that these plants might not flower or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.800 
that these plants might not flower or
fruit<00:01:34.860> either<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.700> found<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.570> not

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
fruit either but I found out that's not

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100 
fruit either but I found out that's not
the<00:01:36.960> case<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.740> flowers<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:39.660> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the case because I have flowers and you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.890 
the case because I have flowers and you
can<00:01:40.230> see<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.630> getting<00:01:42.630> lots

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
can see some of these are getting lots

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.980 
can see some of these are getting lots
and<00:01:43.410> lots<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:43.800> flowers<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.360> these<00:01:45.360> plants<00:01:45.660> are

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and lots of flowers so these plants are

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
and lots of flowers so these plants are
like<00:01:46.140> brand-new<00:01:46.590> Tiny<00:01:47.520> Tim's<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:49.520> they're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like brand-new Tiny Tim's and they're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
like brand-new Tiny Tim's and they're
doing<00:01:50.790> great<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:51.600> guess<00:01:51.750> I'll<00:01:51.900> move<00:01:52.020> them

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
doing great and I guess I'll move them

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.460 
doing great and I guess I'll move them
outside<00:01:52.320> later<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.080> put<00:01:55.080> them<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.410> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
outside later on and put them up in the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.860 
outside later on and put them up in the
windowsill<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.060> couple<00:01:57.270> days<00:01:57.540> and

windowsill here in a couple days and
right<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:58.860> they're<00:01:59.070> under<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.310> t5<00:01:59.910> so<00:02:01.250> they're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
right now they're under a t5 so they're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.170

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
on my unknown variety that I grew have a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
on my unknown variety that I grew have a
few<00:02:10.019> ripe<00:02:10.200> ones<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:10.800> they're<00:02:11.250> really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
few ripe ones right now they're really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.869 
few ripe ones right now they're really
red<00:02:11.819> they're<00:02:12.810> probably<00:02:13.050> inch<00:02:13.980> 1/2<00:02:14.129> 2<00:02:14.640> inches

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I can figure out what kind of tomato it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
I can figure out what kind of tomato it
is<00:02:23.879> by<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.959> way<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> insides<00:02:25.590> look<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.800> yeah

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
is by the way the insides look so yeah

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.059 
is by the way the insides look so yeah
they<00:02:28.980> look<00:02:29.129> really<00:02:29.310> nice

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
they look really nice

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.530 
they look really nice
here's<00:02:32.069> another<00:02:32.190> ripe<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> variety

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
here's another ripe one of that variety

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.589 
here's another ripe one of that variety
and<00:02:34.190> there's<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.280> whole<00:02:35.430> cluster<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> green

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
what's funny is they actually grew up

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.229 
what's funny is they actually grew up
into<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.720> reflector<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.129> kind<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.730> burn

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
into the reflector and kind of burn

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.199 
into the reflector and kind of burn
their<00:03:03.569> way<00:03:03.980> around<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.370> light<00:03:05.549> bulb<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
their way around the light bulb this

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.250 
their way around the light bulb this

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
thing is just overloaded with vegetation

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.140

what this is by the way the insides look
there<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:57.540> cross<00:03:58.139> section<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.099> I<00:03:59.430> cut

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
there is one cross section and I cut

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.960 
there is one cross section and I cut
another<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:01.680> way<00:04:02.660> but<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.400> don't<00:04:05.400> know<00:04:05.609> maybe
