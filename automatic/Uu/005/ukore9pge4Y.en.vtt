one<00:00:06.040> of<00:00:06.129> the<00:00:06.220> reasons<00:00:06.339> we're<00:00:06.670> able<00:00:06.790> to<00:00:06.939> get

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
one of the reasons we're able to get

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.209 
one of the reasons we're able to get
sets<00:00:07.390> the<00:00:07.569> lightning<00:00:08.019> fast<00:00:08.290> results<00:00:08.559> with<00:00:09.010> my

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
sets the lightning fast results with my

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.430 
sets the lightning fast results with my
approach<00:00:09.520> to<00:00:09.549> dog<00:00:09.940> training<00:00:09.969> is<00:00:10.450> that<00:00:10.840> we

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
approach to dog training is that we

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.110 
approach to dog training is that we
advocate<00:00:11.860> using<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.340> techniques<00:00:12.760> around

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
advocate using the techniques around

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.689 
advocate using the techniques around
your<00:00:13.270> everyday<00:00:13.690> lifestyle<00:00:14.379> so<00:00:15.129> instead<00:00:15.639> of

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:15.699 
your everyday lifestyle so instead of

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.450 
your everyday lifestyle so instead of
only<00:00:15.910> practicing<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.779> down<00:00:16.960> stay<00:00:17.350> in<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:18.130> form

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
only practicing the down stay in a form

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.609 
only practicing the down stay in a form
own<00:00:18.640> dog<00:00:18.850> training<00:00:19.210> setting<00:00:19.630> you<00:00:20.289> actually

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
own dog training setting you actually

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.290 
own dog training setting you actually
practice<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.310> commands<00:00:21.669> in<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:21.939> environment

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
practice the commands in the environment

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.599 
practice the commands in the environment
that<00:00:22.630> you'll<00:00:23.349> ultimately<00:00:23.529> want<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.249> use<00:00:24.369> them

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
that you'll ultimately want to use them

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.630 
that you'll ultimately want to use them
in<00:00:24.789> so<00:00:25.509> for<00:00:25.720> example<00:00:25.839> I'm<00:00:26.439> making<00:00:27.249> the<00:00:27.429> dogs

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
in so for example I'm making the dogs

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.730 
in so for example I'm making the dogs
practice<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.329> down<00:00:28.539> stay<00:00:28.929> when<00:00:29.470> I'm<00:00:29.560> working

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
practice the down stay when I'm working

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.370

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
with us and you'll see how I first

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.939 
with us and you'll see how I first
taught<00:00:46.449> him<00:00:46.660> how<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:46.899> go<00:00:47.170> into<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.769> down

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
taught him how to go into the down

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.240 
taught him how to go into the down
position<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.030> command<00:00:49.949> because<00:00:50.949> I'd

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
position on the command because I'd

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.069 
position on the command because I'd
heard<00:00:51.429> that<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:51.820> dog<00:00:52.090> had<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.600> little<00:00:52.929> bit<00:00:53.050> of

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079

training with English commands with his
prior<00:00:55.269> owner<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.929> decided<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.920> use<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.039> German

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
prior owner I decided to use the German

prior owner I decided to use the German
command<00:00:58.000> plots<00:00:58.329> so<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.530> i<00:00:59.679> could

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
command plots so that so that i could

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.009 
command plots so that so that i could
teach<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.339> command<00:01:00.699> or<00:01:01.269> teach<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.600> behavior

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
teach the command or teach the behavior

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:29.250 
teach the command or teach the behavior

with<00:03:07.580> your<00:03:07.760> own<00:03:07.880> dog<00:03:13.300> there<00:03:14.300> are<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> lot<00:03:14.510> of

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
with your own dog there are a lot of

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.360 
with your own dog there are a lot of
subtle<00:03:15.110> hammond<00:03:15.440> techniques<00:03:15.860> i'm<00:03:16.040> using<00:03:16.340> here

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
subtle hammond techniques i'm using here

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.550 
subtle hammond techniques i'm using here
which<00:03:17.180> may<00:03:17.600> not<00:03:17.630> be<00:03:17.810> immediately<00:03:18.380> apparent

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
which may not be immediately apparent

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.800 
which may not be immediately apparent
for<00:03:19.220> example<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.670> notice<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.239> when<00:03:20.690> i'm

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
for example you notice that when i'm

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.600 
for example you notice that when i'm
telling<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.440> dog<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.769> go<00:03:21.890> into<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.190> down<00:03:22.370> at

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
telling the dog to go into the down at

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.780 
telling the dog to go into the down at
this<00:03:23.030> point<00:03:23.450> I'm<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:24.320> bending<00:03:24.769> over<00:03:25.250> because

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
this point I'm not bending over because

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.160 
this point I'm not bending over because
what<00:03:25.940> will<00:03:26.000> happen<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.600> dog<00:03:26.780> will<00:03:26.959> start

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
what will happen is the dog will start

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.350 
what will happen is the dog will start
queuing<00:03:27.680> off<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.340> body<00:03:28.640> language<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:29.060> bending

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
queuing off the body language of bending

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.880 
queuing off the body language of bending
