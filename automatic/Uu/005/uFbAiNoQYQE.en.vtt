then I'm going to cut them into not too
small<00:00:46.030> chunks<00:00:46.480> because<00:00:46.629> it'll<00:00:46.960> take<00:00:47.140> on<00:00:47.379> too

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680

for<00:01:39.030> everyday<00:01:39.360> eating<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.110> put<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.410> very

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
for everyday eating I would put a very

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
for everyday eating I would put a very
small<00:01:40.890> knob<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.550> butter<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:42.930> bit

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
so we're going to have a look and see if

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630 
so we're going to have a look and see if
these<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.180> cooked<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.590> easiest<00:01:59.100> way<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
these are cooked the easiest way is to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.780 
these are cooked the easiest way is to
get<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.970> knife<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.080> just<00:02:01.320> put<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.400> point<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
get a knife and just put the point of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.280 
get a knife and just put the point of
the<00:02:02.880> knife<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.300> potato<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> should<00:02:04.080> go

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the knife in the potato and it should go

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 
the knife in the potato and it should go
in<00:02:04.470> very<00:02:04.710> easily<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.180> does<00:02:06.409> drain<00:02:07.409> them

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
in very easily which it does drain them

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.880 
in very easily which it does drain them
thoroughly

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.830 

careful<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.500> splash<00:02:17.329> then<00:02:18.329> pop<00:02:18.540> them<00:02:18.689> back
