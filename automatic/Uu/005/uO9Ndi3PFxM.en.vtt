setting there are some bubbles inside

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.260 
setting there are some bubbles inside
and<00:00:22.250> or<00:00:22.340> if<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:22.550> can<00:00:22.730> see<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:24.850> we'll<00:00:25.850> see<00:00:26.060> what

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
and or if you can see and we'll see what

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.090 
and or if you can see and we'll see what
happens<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.810> started<00:00:27.200> at<00:00:27.289> Northpoint<00:00:27.740> seven

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
happens it started at Northpoint seven

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.019 
happens it started at Northpoint seven
volts<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:28.750> for<00:00:29.750> milliamps<00:00:30.789> so<00:00:31.789> i<00:00:31.820> should

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
volts and for milliamps so i should

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.610 
volts and for milliamps so i should
think<00:00:32.210> i'll<00:00:32.329> run<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.599> for<00:00:32.719> 10<00:00:32.899> minutes<00:00:33.140> i<00:00:33.379> saw

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
think i'll run it for 10 minutes i saw

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.770 
think i'll run it for 10 minutes i saw
and<00:00:33.860> then<00:00:34.010> see<00:00:34.190> what<00:00:34.280> happens<00:00:37.150> ok<00:00:38.150> about<00:00:38.390> five

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
and then see what happens ok about five

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.720 
and then see what happens ok about five
minutes<00:00:38.989> later<00:00:39.320> asst<00:00:39.560> detected<00:00:40.340> there<00:00:40.520> that

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
minutes later asst detected there that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.450 
minutes later asst detected there that
the<00:00:40.910> cell<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.270> apparently<00:00:42.079> charged<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.860> i

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
the cell is apparently charged and i

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.030 
the cell is apparently charged and i
believe<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.850> one<00:00:44.030> flash<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.470> one<00:00:45.710> self

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040

too<00:01:23.679> well<00:01:24.679> here's<00:01:25.039> a<00:01:25.189> circuit<00:01:26.079> about<00:01:27.079> the

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
too well here's a circuit about the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.870 
too well here's a circuit about the

charges<00:02:08.290> look<00:02:08.440> well<00:02:08.650> there<00:02:08.770> we<00:02:08.860> go<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
charges look well there we go so the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.710 
charges look well there we go so the
lights<00:02:09.490> on<00:02:09.700> I'll<00:02:09.880> turn<00:02:10.090> off<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.360> light<00:02:10.540> now

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
lights on I'll turn off the light now

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.790 
lights on I'll turn off the light now
i'll<00:02:10.840> show<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> brightness<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:14.680> we

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
i'll show you the brightness there we

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.180 
i'll show you the brightness there we
are<00:02:16.350> nice<00:02:17.350> another<00:02:17.590> white<00:02:17.770> cool<00:02:18.130> night<00:02:18.640> lately

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
are nice another white cool night lately

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.530 
are nice another white cool night lately
so<00:02:21.190> that's<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.700> kind<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.910> practical<00:02:22.270> thing

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
so that's the kind of practical thing

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.980 
so that's the kind of practical thing
you<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.960> from<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:25.240> we<00:02:25.390> are<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
you can do from there we are as the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.820 
you can do from there we are as the
circus<00:02:26.380> ago<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.660> only<00:02:28.750> uses<00:02:29.020> 2<00:02:29.440> milliamps

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
circus ago and it only uses 2 milliamps

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.230 
circus ago and it only uses 2 milliamps
I've<00:02:30.430> run<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.910> setup<00:02:31.530> from<00:02:32.530> solar<00:02:32.800> power<00:02:33.240> and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
I've run this setup from solar power and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.090 
I've run this setup from solar power and
he<00:02:35.050> only<00:02:35.200> uses<00:02:35.470> 2<00:02:35.830> milliamps<00:02:37.740> but<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.860> does

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
he only uses 2 milliamps but it does
