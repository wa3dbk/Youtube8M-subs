00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
using setup a pitch up okay and I like

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.389 
using setup a pitch up okay and I like
using<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> keyboard<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.350> also<00:00:34.399> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
using it on the keyboard and also the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.850 
using it on the keyboard and also the
way<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> set<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.840> inverted<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
way it is set up it's not inverted it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.540 
way it is set up it's not inverted it's
normal<00:00:38.219> setup<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:40.790> know<00:00:41.790> W<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> pitch<00:00:42.719> up

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
normal setup so you know W the pitch up

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.410 
normal setup so you know W the pitch up
s<00:00:44.550> would<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.910> pitched<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.739> okay<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
s would be pitched down okay so if I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.229 
s would be pitched down okay so if I
want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.809> down<00:00:49.020> I'll<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.000> use

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
want to go down I'll do this and I use

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
want to go down I'll do this and I use
Delta<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> D<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:54.079> go<00:00:55.079> sideways<00:00:57.800> over<00:00:58.800> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
Delta or in a D to go sideways over all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.870 
Delta or in a D to go sideways over all
right<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> core<00:01:04.890> flow<00:01:05.100> left<00:01:05.400> would<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
right and core flow left would be a so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990 
right and core flow left would be a so
that's<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.720> my<00:01:06.869> keyboard<00:01:07.049> setup<00:01:08.000> now

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.830 
notice it because hopefully let me get
speeded<00:02:31.330> up<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:33.610> when<00:02:34.420> I'm<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
speeded up here and then when I'm in the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.130 
speeded up here and then when I'm in the
turn<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:36.550> that's<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.150> pretty<00:02:37.480> wide<00:02:37.750> turn<00:02:38.110> so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
turn see that's a pretty wide turn so

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.170 
turn see that's a pretty wide turn so
I'll<00:02:38.530> go<00:02:38.650> ahead<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.920> put<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.069> break<00:02:39.370> off<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I'll go ahead and put a break off and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.820 
I'll go ahead and put a break off and
now<00:02:40.390> all<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> sudden<00:02:40.720> my<00:02:41.080> turn<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.440> tightened

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
now all the sudden my turn is tightened

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.880 
now all the sudden my turn is tightened
up<00:02:41.920> something<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.060> use<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:43.900> break<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.860> that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
up something so use that break so that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.699 
up something so use that break so that
spacebar<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:46.030> what<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.239> use<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:46.540> break<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
spacebar is what I use for break and

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.680 
spacebar is what I use for break and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
key it sits well because that's pretty

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.310
