00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.969 
we're gonna put them in a randomizer
thingy<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:46.079> kind<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
thingy and then that's kind of like the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
thingy and then that's kind of like the
draft<00:01:47.250> order<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.759> who<00:01:48.420> gets<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.140> draft<00:01:49.409> what

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
draft order of who gets to draft what

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
draft order of who gets to draft what
team<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> number<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
team so if you're the number one on the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
team so if you're the number one on the
list<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.990> get<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.470> pick<00:01:52.619> whoever<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:53.220> in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
list you get to pick whoever you want in

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030 
list you get to pick whoever you want in
the<00:01:54.720> mat<00:01:54.869> conference<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.920> you're

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the mat conference and then when you're

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
the mat conference and then when you're
number<00:01:56.219> five<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.729> pick<00:01:56.909> from<00:01:57.600> whoever's<00:01:58.049> left

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
number five you pick from whoever's left

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.679 
number five you pick from whoever's left
so<00:01:58.740> once<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.820> through<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.119> 12<00:02:00.299> teams

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
so once we get through all 12 teams

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.730 
so once we get through all 12 teams
there<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.590> our<00:02:01.829> starting<00:02:02.070> lineup

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and as part of that since we're all

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309

playing<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.270> same<00:02:09.450> conference<00:02:09.840> ninety

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
playing in the same conference ninety

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.520 
playing in the same conference ninety
percent<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> games<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> be

percent of the games are going to be

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.090 
percent of the games are going to be
