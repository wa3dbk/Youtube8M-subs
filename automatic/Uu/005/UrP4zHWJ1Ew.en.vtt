00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.260
 today is Thursday the 17th in the nourished its started 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.779
 knowledge 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 throughout the beginning of our 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.519
 investigation we have found that the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.260
 logic of the experience of art has 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.850
 as a foundation a permanent conflict 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 include soluble aporia reside 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.550
 paradoxically their conditions of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.550
 possibility 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.190
 the conflict has been exhibited as a 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.309
 basic disagreement between reality 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.309
 effective 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.420
 and extensible of the objects of the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.609
 artifacts 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.000
 and the primacy of the emergence of 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.490
 works 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.410
 On the other hand, this disagreement has 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.270
 traditionally conceived as a 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.719
 rift 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.840
 between the tried in the achieved truth 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.299
 of knowledge should be its 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.090
 conformity to the contrary a result of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.460
 the constitution of the truth objects of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.979
 the things for which there are not the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.979
 things as they truly are 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.650
 the art experience that moves us 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 to a dimension in which the objects do not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.310
 are found or reflected but that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.310
 are in the process of being constituted 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.960
 and in this attempt to build 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 operations necessarily intervene 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.290
 in this case the constitutive problems 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.659
 differ according to the different 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.460
 anthological ways of giving things in 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.460
 the uniform course of experience 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.640
 we are not just talking about the problem of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.010
 the subjectivity 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.160
 if not the problem also to your 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.290
 objectivity and objectivity in its 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.310
 reference in mutual through the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.310
 art experience 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.420
 just as we just pointed the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 constitution is not simply the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.099
 evolution of subjectivity idealism 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 extreme nor the evolution of reality 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.860
 as an independent process and the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 consciousness realism but development 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.300
 of reality and subjectivity in their 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 mutual fundamental relationship 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.830
 in this second link relationship is going to 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.770
 stress the limits of dialectics 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.900
 between both poles modifying the process 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.550
 constitutive of objectivity as well as 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.110
 the evolution of subjectivity in the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.110
 same process in which it intervenes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.190
 in this way we will speak rather of a 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.379
 involution of subjectivity that we 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.840
 leaves still clear in previous strata the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.430
 constitution of objectivity in the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.459
 jump itself from the immanence of the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.240
 consciousness to the transcendence of the world 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.400
 objective 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 as we have argued until this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.380
 moment will be their own and not themselves and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.470
 effect is of subjectivity the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.850
 only responsible for this arrest 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.710
 thematized throughout the history of 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.900
 thinking from different 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.260
 theoretical formulations from the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.940
 Platonic idealism to phenomenology 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.980
 from the bone card jana foundation of the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.460
 aesthetics to aesthetic theories 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.460
 contemporary 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.180
 the philosophical concern about 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.950
 this strange evolution has surpassed the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.650
 conceptual frameworks of reflection 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 about the artistic act moving 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.750
 to the structure I do not know or logic of 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.510
 experience process 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.760
 the overcoming of psychologism the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.730
 reduction is very positivist or of the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.370
 structuralism 1a simplifier has us 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.200
 led to the immediate search for 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.030
 legalities in which the process of 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.790
 constitution of the objectivity that has 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.060
 interrupted showing the nature of 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.610
 art in the middle of the receptor dynamism 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
 actions and acts that are required for 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.450
 that a reality has the character of a 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.450
 object in the world of things 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.610
 the analysis of objectivity in art 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.690
 He has referred us to reflect on the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.800
 various ways in which I tried 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:38.860
 will be the gms ie is constituted 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.389
 this examination has led us to the study 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.220
 the conditions that make the 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.960
 work of art according to the diversity of 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.930
 fundamental ways of being three objects 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.660
 in our conditions we have found 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.490
 the objective affectations felt but 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.259
 not of a I formally conceived as 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.259
 the set of a priori conditions 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:02.099
 of the objects but denounced concrete and 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:05.509
 current that is displayed in its untimely 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.509
 encounter with art 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.699
 what it operated with the most index 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.560
 we lived in the natural salvation of 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.870
 world of things has to become 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.650
 now in the object of an investigation 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.630
 methodical 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.060
 we have seen as a logic of 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.800
 aesthetic experience has revealed us the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.150
 diversity of correlations between 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.530
 material decisions and 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.880
 corresponding to carry out actions 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.880
 operative of subjectivity 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.620
 as if we were talking about a deep 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.040
 weave of strata galleries our 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.870
 integration you should extend in a 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.180
 gradation of levels in a 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.180
 architecture of different regimes 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.919
 for each unit at a higher level of 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.139
 appearances it is necessary to discover a 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.139
 Apparential phenomenon diversity is a 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.080
 a deeper level 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.270
 species hosted this complicity of 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.759
 anthological ranges in their dependence on 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.650
 relation to high objectives 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.689
 corresponding so that each 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.819
 level has to be the condition of 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.129
 possibility for the attempt of 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.870
 constitution of the unit 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.870
 corresponding in the upper level
