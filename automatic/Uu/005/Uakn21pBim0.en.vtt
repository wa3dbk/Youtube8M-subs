00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.010 
be placed into the easy data feed so
here<00:02:24.680> here's<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.490> them<00:02:25.720> we'll<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:26.900> give

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
here here's all of them we'll just give

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.550 
here here's all of them we'll just give
it<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.200> second<00:02:27.560> for<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.040> extract<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> data

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
it a second for it to extract the data

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.250 
it a second for it to extract the data
so<00:02:30.560> once<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.190> process<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.880> complete<00:02:32.480> you're

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
so once this process is complete you're

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.550 
so once this process is complete you're
going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.710> save<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.310> CSV<00:02:35.180> sheet<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.810> your

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
going to save a CSV sheet on your

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.760 
going to save a CSV sheet on your
computer<00:02:37.070> with<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.000> information<00:02:38.770> we're

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
computer with the information we're

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.190 
computer with the information we're
going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.220> ahead<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.520> open<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.660> we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
going to go ahead and open it up and we

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.850 
going to go ahead and open it up and we
are<00:02:42.350> going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.650> find<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.520> column<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.150> says

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
are going to find the column that says

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.550 
are going to find the column that says
Asin<00:02:45.860> number<00:02:46.460> which<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.660> here<00:02:47.690> we're

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
Asin number which is this one here we're

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.590 
Asin number which is this one here we're
going<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.740> copy<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> Asin<00:02:50.270> numbers

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
going to copy all of the Asin numbers

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.810 
going to copy all of the Asin numbers
then<00:02:51.080> we're<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.380> open<00:02:51.590> up<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.460> shopping

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
then we're going to open up the shopping

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.590 
then we're going to open up the shopping
cart<00:02:53.050> we're<00:02:54.050> going<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.290> go<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> products

heaters<00:03:13.570> now<00:03:14.570> keep<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.900> mind<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:16.010> not

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
heaters now keep in mind that it's not

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.670 
heaters now keep in mind that it's not
going<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.700> find<00:03:16.940> every<00:03:17.540> single<00:03:17.780> Asin<00:03:18.440> number

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
going to find every single Asin number

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.130 
going to find every single Asin number
because<00:03:18.980> sometimes<00:03:19.460> Amazon<00:03:20.000> does<00:03:20.180> not<00:03:20.390> carry

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
because sometimes Amazon does not carry

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.030 
because sometimes Amazon does not carry
over<00:03:21.400> some<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.670> data<00:03:22.910> such<00:03:23.330> as<00:03:23.740> images<00:03:24.740> or

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
over some of the data such as images or

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.870 
over some of the data such as images or
offer<00:03:26.030> ID<00:03:26.630> or<00:03:27.200> there's<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.310> bunch<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.730> different

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
offer ID or there's a bunch of different

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.600 
offer ID or there's a bunch of different
things<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.690> Amazon<00:03:30.230> might<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:30.650> send<00:03:31.310> over

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
things that Amazon might not send over

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.630 
things that Amazon might not send over
so<00:03:32.150> whatever<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.230> does<00:03:33.350> find<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.460> end

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
so whatever it does find is going to end

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.210 
so whatever it does find is going to end
up<00:03:34.850> here<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> once<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.890> is<00:03:36.950> here<00:03:37.490> now<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.960> can

up here so once it is here now you can
just<00:03:40.220> double<00:03:40.460> check<00:03:40.670> make<00:03:40.850> sure<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.300> is

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
just double check make sure this is

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.830

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
can just check them all and say validate

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.550 
can just check them all and say validate
to<00:03:59.120> see<00:03:59.300> what's<00:03:59.600> missing<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:00.200> here<00:04:00.410> it's
