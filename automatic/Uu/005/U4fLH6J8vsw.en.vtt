 Today 's auto sport is hitting a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.390
 and who comes to keep company here 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.350
 To the people in the studio, taffo, captain of the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 penta 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 Thank you. Welcome, thank you. Good day. 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.830
 11 until you changed the ball for a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.289
 helmet without a doubt is very 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 time I always liked motorbikes. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.390
 I always liked to see the GPS modes 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300
 I went to some motorcycle races 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.519
 but also because of the commitments that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 I had professionals could not walk 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 of mota aim to give a little hidden but 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 the athletes can not ride a bike right 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.270
 not only denotes it can also practice 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.329
 extreme sports an insecurity 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 contract type jump parachute 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 Motta these things can not but after 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.399
 I hung up my boots and put 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 the helmet 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 now I'm enjoying this a lot 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 fan of the speed the speed of the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 two wheels and this is an exclusive page 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 your granddaughter has already made a point of sharing 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 with your kids, I know them 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.440
 also enjoy a jajÃ¡ motorcycle every 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.000
 my children short my daughter too 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 She likes very much but she is holding a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 little but my two older 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 Danilo is 24 she is 23 that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 They like motorcycles a lot, too. 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 A funny story in the background is a 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 time he was passing some photos on the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 computer pulls out some photos here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.400
 I'm seeing some pictures - web picture as 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 all little boy on a bike 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840
 track giving that jump of five 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 meters was a question and they only train 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 turn around 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 when I went to see him on the trail or 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 I knew he was riding a motorcycle then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.200
 passion has come a long time and now 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.820
 so we'll see the car and the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.770
 his sons on the track 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 the children of the car are in the wave of the father 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.170
 just want to know about sports bikes and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.509
 these machines can not be 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.700
 The first edition looks at the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.039
 Spanish people do not walk is different from 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.539
 mark on the front with the back it 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.720
 Do not talk motorcycle will have a 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.640
 reaction in the unstable Spanish has already been 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.320
 it's time to change, you 'll lose 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.330
 front lose front does not exist 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.970
 control technique will lead to a 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.960
 tumble 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.960
 let's change map 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.090
 accompany it notes the positioning 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 of wellington in the curves very good 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.610
 the dog I found it cool to pay a 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.470
 Slight kid kicking but gave 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 was keeping a hospital stay 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.340
 unnecessary fighting with the bike 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.650
 while I might have gotten up in a burp 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.750
 there passed its vision as 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.100
 Funny, you'll be much faster. 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.060
 and especially will have neither with 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.070
 safety 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 the body game changes everything in driving 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.690
 and one of the most common mistakes is in 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.880
 how to use the arms 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.490
 we do not put the arm to support 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.709
 of our body in the legs or secret is 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.750
 to enjoy the anatomy of the tank so 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.030
 who never inserts this part needs 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.640
 friction entering the curve is the body that goes 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 direct by doing this from here or by playing 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.300
 naturally to support my body 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.220
 I'm stepping on my body pedal 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.230
 tattooed on Monday that faith is not the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.300
 outside will share that burden and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.660
 thought it would be quite relaxed now in 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.870
 In 2009 the two arms now doubt 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.760
 When it's time to make it very strong. 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.630
 I just want to harden it, that's worse. 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.070
 according to the door here thinks that for 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.780
 annul this force from April to 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.970
 trajectory, we have to increase the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.280
 seriousness many people did was to include 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.260
 motorcycle too much to urinate 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 tire profile in the limit the chance of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.830
 slip too big for this 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.320
 work the body is always we have 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.870
 that being an athlete maximizes the bike 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.780
 and work the body handlebars just invite 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.200
 that it is heavy work without 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.200
 out 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.840
 on track the danilo is more abused but 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.850
 Are you doing everything right? 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.920
 you play the right way you can trace the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.840
 low adrenaline that is what 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.180
 accelerate in the first round but you're 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.190
 so much sitting on the bike was cheering 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.930
 sorry for you doing it here O 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.360
 I did not want to cite 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:18.810
 here will tire malu only right remembered 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.550
 total boy and looks at holding but takes 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.140
 one way I was here just training 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.690
 talking, let my father get to him 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.900
 arrive and that is already going to 10 pass the father 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.390
 be held tomorrow in a little while 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.570
 The tips for the car are on top of the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.570
 moto 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.700
 The bike for us is emotion with 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.380
 responsibility is in passing 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.250
 I think the responsibility upon 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.440
 A motorcycle 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
 It's all because a lot of people talk more 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.740
 Actually the bike was made here and it is 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.030
 two wheels 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.280
 now as it counts for you to have 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.870
 your first bike the first bike there is 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.940
 five years ago you used to go out 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.770
 alone on a motorcycle or not always in a group 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.030
 Where do you always go in group? 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.460
 especially on weekends 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.770
 Saturday and Sunday, both in Brazil and abroad. 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.180
 I have a commitment is sacred and 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.180
 road and fell through this world outside
