00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello how are I triforce and here to 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.930
 Below I will show you how 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.600
 root your samsung galaxy now 2 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.210
 as several of you have been 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.970
 acquire this great device 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.429
 then what really takes a lot 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.349
 the procedure is very simple and 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.419
 Well, what they are going to get is 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.060
 it can only be is the root access 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.470
 nothing else any extra modification by 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.970
 If some applications require 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.980
 root that are going to occupy so good 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.360
 they will be able to do it as I say 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.430
 a fairly simple and fast way 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.340
 they obviously need good their 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.530
 samsung galaxy 12 since we know that from 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.260
 factory comes with android 411 jay levine 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.780
 then since we have 12 we have 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.480
 need odin software is the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.270
 version 304 except with him so that what 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.710
 download in our blog on android mx 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.930
 dot net in the tutorial that will be 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.690
 there also and well we need a 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.820
 small file that is called c / s 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.230
 autoroute samsung galaxy awards that 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.370
 Also here 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.990
 I'm going to show you we have the same but 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.060
 the same is going to be put so that what 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.810
 download 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 and good 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 we have to pay it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.060
 it does not matter which compilation has its 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.289
 samsung choice 2 while you have there 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.500
 the living very good 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.000
 it's practically universal we put it in 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.039
 download mosqueda how is it 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.470
 we do with the volume button below the 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.829
 power button and home at the same 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.829
 weather 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.380
 appears on those screens we make 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.230
 with the volume button above to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.750
 enter and we enter there 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.630
 this next step open your software 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.670
 odin I already have here open this up like this 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.270
 that for practical reasons I have 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.460
 that open connect your choice or via 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.550
 usb to the computer conquers the cable 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.010
 we connect it and automatically that 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.990
 you have to recognize your compu and so 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.150
 so much the software odin here already 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.950
 it is recognized it is very important that 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.890
 this rectangle appears in blue 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 it does not matter what number they say 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.970
 little bit more sport number that says 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.730
 within 25 can be 13 can be everything 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.740
 7 any number does not matter always 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 when this other channel appears because 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.570
 appeared the options do not touch them the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.850
 they leave as they do not touch anything of dvorak 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.370
 and that really gets into trouble like that 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.690
 which appears they let go they apply van 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.080
 to press the fight button 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.770
 and here where are you going to select the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.390
 File cf autoroute samsung galaxy on 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.640
 cars eye 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.130
 the file extension is such a point 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 because if you download it in good cycle what 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.170
 have to decompress it seems to have the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.790
 file point of r or such that is the one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.890
 recognizes or from here to selected it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.079
 I'll start him what we're going to do 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.530
 by pressure to be and this process is not 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.650
 they have not even ten seconds 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.930
 I'll start watching it is working and 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.020
 as you can see it's going by evaluating the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.690
 progress here also he did on 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.510
 start the team here already says peace already 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.790
 they can be rolling and that's basically 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.770
 everything already have root access on your computer 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.640
 there it is flowing 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.880
 the special screen many galaxy 12 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.209
 obviously this was done in fire as 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.730
 all of the older ones practically 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.140
 samsung galaxy good here is already what 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.780
 you can connect it to any kind of 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.569
 problem and once your team gets 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.700
 reboot you will already have root access going to 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.230
 have the super show icon and then 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.300
 well, if I make an application that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.850
 you want to install requires 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.870
 Broken no longer will they be able to do it without 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.870
 problem some 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.629
 as you can check that they already have root 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.170
 simply because you are going to have here the 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.170
 application 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.959
 super your teacher and you can see it is 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.150
 android with its capital those that already that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.510
 index that indicates they already have access 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.879
 is basically the same root would be all 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.799
 is that already show with left is 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.209

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.280
 have your file downloaded since 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.289
 have the odin your computer with 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.360
