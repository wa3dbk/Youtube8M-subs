off this visor thing clips on to the
mask<00:03:39.350> right<00:03:39.620> here<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.300> actually<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:42.350> like

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
mask right here so it actually I like

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.660 
mask right here so it actually I like
the<00:03:42.800> return<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.120> new<00:03:44.600> clear<00:03:45.500> piece<00:03:45.830> again

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.400 

so<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.340> play<00:03:55.550> experience<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:56.480> don't

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
so well for the play experience I don't

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.270 
so well for the play experience I don't
know<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:58.910> what<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:03:59.450> see<00:04:00.140> last<00:04:01.010> year

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
know this is what I think see last year

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.640 
know this is what I think see last year
we<00:04:01.430> had<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.970> blue<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.870> white<00:04:02.960> tour<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.590> year

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
we had a blue and white tour this year

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.070 
we had a blue and white tour this year
we<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> lime<00:04:04.580> green<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:05.390> blue<00:04:05.750> trailer

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
we have a lime green and blue trailer

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.010 
we have a lime green and blue trailer
now<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.070> think<00:04:07.520> so<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.330> choice<00:04:08.570> of<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.840> lime

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
now I think so the choice of the lime

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.570 
now I think so the choice of the lime
green<00:04:09.320> was<00:04:09.500> because<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.130> undersea

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
green was because of the undersea

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.530 
green was because of the undersea
seaweed<00:04:11.090> but<00:04:11.620> she<00:04:12.620> looks<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.310> think<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.300> fans

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
seaweed but she looks I think the fans

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.300 
seaweed but she looks I think the fans
will<00:04:14.900> actually<00:04:15.680> make<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:17.590> good<00:04:18.590> addition<00:04:18.680> on<00:04:19.130> to

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
will actually make a good addition on to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.270 
will actually make a good addition on to
her<00:04:19.460> for<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.840> year<00:04:21.230> if<00:04:21.410> it's<00:04:21.739> underwater<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
her for this year if it's underwater the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.760 
her for this year if it's underwater the
old<00:04:25.640> head<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.540> mast<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:27.050> compatible<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.650> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
old head the mast is compatible with the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.100 
old head the mast is compatible with the
old<00:04:27.980> head<00:04:28.280> which<00:04:28.580> means<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.180> unlike<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
old head which means that unlike the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
compatible with other masks she's very

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.510

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
the fins give extra possibility as you

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.970 
the fins give extra possibility as you

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.190 

for<00:05:11.720> overall<00:05:12.400> its<00:05:13.400> she's<00:05:14.030> asked<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.780> how<00:05:14.960> he's
