00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
to be using nail varnish and I do not

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.720 
to be using nail varnish and I do not
want<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> breathe<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> stuff<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.040> so<00:00:29.040> I've

want to breathe that stuff in so I've
got<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> frame<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.040> run-of-the-mill

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
got a frame just a run-of-the-mill

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
got a frame just a run-of-the-mill
picture<00:00:32.790> frame<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> glass<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:35.300> I'm<00:00:36.300> going

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
picture frame with a glass and I'm going

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.639 
picture frame with a glass and I'm going
to<00:00:36.920> just<00:00:37.920> take<00:00:39.170> bottle<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.440> nail<00:00:40.649> varnish<00:00:41.570> and

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
to just take bottle of nail varnish and

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.320 
to just take bottle of nail varnish and
I'm<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> set<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> background<00:00:44.690> so

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
I'm going to set up the background so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:01:01.910 
I'm going to set up the background so
just<00:00:48.330> gonna<00:00:48.540> dump<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.110> contents

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.860 

I'm<00:01:02.920> going<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.130> kind<00:01:03.340> of<00:01:03.460> tilt<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.420> it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
I'm going to kind of tilt it so that it

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.000 
I'm going to kind of tilt it so that it
gets<00:01:05.019> into<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.470> crevices<00:01:06.130> now<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.740> very

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
gets into the crevices now it's very

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.960 
gets into the crevices now it's very
likely<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.970> paint<00:01:10.240> will<00:01:10.540> leak<00:01:10.810> through

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
likely that the paint will leak through

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.790 
likely that the paint will leak through
the<00:01:12.970> back<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.600> frame<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.320> might<00:01:14.619> want

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
the back of the frame so you might want

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.380 
the back of the frame so you might want
to<00:01:14.830> lay<00:01:14.979> newspaper<00:01:15.430> down<00:01:15.670> if<00:01:15.970> you've<00:01:16.180> got<00:01:16.360> a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
to lay newspaper down if you've got a

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.990 
to lay newspaper down if you've got a
surface<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:16.869> don't<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.729> want<00:01:18.910> to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000
