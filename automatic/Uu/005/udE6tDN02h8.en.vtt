move that color vampire you must move to
vampires<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.189> possible<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.259> roll

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469

three or four bats you can't move you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
three or four bats you can't move you
can<00:02:04.020> only<00:02:04.110> move<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.070> zero<00:02:05.399> but

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
can only move one or actually zero but

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
can only move one or actually zero but
of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> remaining<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.020> days<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
of the remaining three days here in this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.770 
of the remaining three days here in this
situation<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.550> must<00:02:08.849> pick<00:02:09.060> two<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.599> I'm

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
situation I must pick two of them I'm

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.500 
situation I must pick two of them I'm
going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> move<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.379> vampires<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.760> far<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.480> my

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
going to move to vampires that far on my

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
going to move to vampires that far on my
turn

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
turn

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.080 
turn
so<00:02:13.709> let's<00:02:13.860> say<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.010> instance<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.580> pick<00:02:14.790> red

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so let's say this instance I pick red

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.020 
so let's say this instance I pick red
and<00:02:15.360> green<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.620> red<00:02:16.830> will<00:02:17.010> move<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.370> space<00:02:17.519> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
and green so red will move one space and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.170 
and green so red will move one space and
green<00:02:18.269> will<00:02:19.050> move<00:02:19.260> three<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.940> very<00:02:21.120> very

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
green will move three and it's very very

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.949 
green will move three and it's very very
simple<00:02:21.390> once<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.379> player<00:02:23.239> moves<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.420> vampire<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
simple once a player moves a vampire to

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.430 
simple once a player moves a vampire to
the<00:02:25.050> top<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.800> vampire<00:02:26.099> gets<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.989> token

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the top that vampire gets the token

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.800 
the top that vampire gets the token
that's<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> three<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:30.180> point<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
that's on the three at that point the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.509 
that's on the three at that point the
other<00:02:30.959> toke<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.410> token<00:02:31.680> number<00:02:31.860> two<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.280> moved

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
other toke the token number two is moved

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.089 
other toke the token number two is moved
to<00:02:32.730> three<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.780> token<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.830> moved<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
to three the token on one is moved to

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.390 
to three the token on one is moved to
two<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:36.180> new<00:02:36.390> token<00:02:36.780> comes<00:02:37.049> out<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> we

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
two and a new token comes out and we

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.940 
two and a new token comes out and we
continue<00:02:38.879> one<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.629> vampire<00:02:40.080> goes<00:02:40.500> back<00:02:40.769> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
continue one the vampire goes back to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.350 
continue one the vampire goes back to
its<00:02:40.980> house<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> new<00:02:42.120> token

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
its house as you can see the new token

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690 
its house as you can see the new token
has<00:02:42.629> come<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.900> as<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.080> tomato<00:02:43.319> which<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.459> worth

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
has come out as a tomato which is worth

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.199 
has come out as a tomato which is worth
a<00:02:44.910> negative<00:02:45.390> point<00:02:45.630> at<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.049> end<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> game

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
a negative point at the end of the game

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.569 
a negative point at the end of the game
so<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:49.260> you're<00:02:49.410> trying<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.310> you're

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
so what you're trying to do is you're

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.390 
so what you're trying to do is you're
trying<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.880> get<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.030> vampire<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> top

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.759 
trying to get your vampire to the top
when<00:02:53.599> garlic<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.750> there<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.230> move<00:02:55.530> other

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
when garlic is there and move other

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.860 
when garlic is there and move other
people's<00:02:56.220> vampires<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> top<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
people's vampires to the top when the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.650 
people's vampires to the top when the
tomatoes<00:02:58.440> are<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:58.769> now<00:02:59.280> at<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.120> same<00:03:00.360> time

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
tomatoes are there now at the same time

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.449 
tomatoes are there now at the same time
and<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.319> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.620> harder<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.040> kids

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and this is going to be harder for kids

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.339 
and this is going to be harder for kids
you're<00:03:03.120> trying<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.629> prevent<00:03:03.959> people<00:03:04.319> from

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
you're trying to prevent people from

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.979 
you're trying to prevent people from
knowing<00:03:04.680> which<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.340> yours<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:06.420> maybe<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
knowing which one is yours so maybe you

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.509 
knowing which one is yours so maybe you
might<00:03:07.500> give<00:03:07.799> up<00:03:08.959> garlic<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.739> another<00:03:11.190> player

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
might give up garlic to another player

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.520 
might give up garlic to another player
just<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.360> keep<00:03:12.540> other<00:03:12.810> people<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:13.200> thinking

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
just to keep other people from thinking

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.500 
just to keep other people from thinking
that<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:13.920> player<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.519> as<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.360> see

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that that player as you as you can see

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.050 
that that player as you as you can see
here<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> distribution<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> tiles

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
here in the distribution of the tiles

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.000 
here in the distribution of the tiles
there<00:03:18.060> are<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:18.299> threes<00:03:18.690> twos<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.470> ones<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
there are some threes twos and ones and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.520 
there are some threes twos and ones and
then<00:03:20.280> some<00:03:20.940> tomatoes<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.290> there's<00:03:22.470> a

then some tomatoes and so there's a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.890 
then some tomatoes and so there's a
pretty<00:03:22.769> even<00:03:23.400> mix<00:03:23.880> when<00:03:24.209> all<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> tiles<00:03:24.810> are

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
pretty even mix when all the tiles are

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.470 
pretty even mix when all the tiles are
gone<00:03:25.139> players<00:03:25.889> add<00:03:26.160> up<00:03:26.280> their<00:03:26.430> points<00:03:26.790> whoever

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
gone players add up their points whoever

time over the most tokens wins there's a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.780 
time over the most tokens wins there's a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
even think twice about playing the game

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.920 
even think twice about playing the game
in<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.549> board<00:03:44.819> that's<00:03:45.269> very<00:03:45.510> good<00:03:45.660> artwork

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
in the board that's very good artwork

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.319 
in the board that's very good artwork
the<00:03:46.620> tiles<00:03:46.889> are<00:03:47.099> very<00:03:47.370> easy<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.910> manipulate

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
the tiles are very easy to manipulate

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.809

color<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.239> very<00:03:51.419> obvious<00:03:51.870> what<00:03:52.169> color<00:03:52.440> you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680

are<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:54.389> gameplay<00:03:54.750> itself<00:03:54.810> i<00:03:55.260> find<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> very

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
are the gameplay itself i find it very

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.569 
are the gameplay itself i find it very
good<00:03:56.280> for<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:57.709> children's<00:03:58.709> game<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> sense

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
good for a children's game in a sense

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.080 
good for a children's game in a sense

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the box here says five to 99 i would say

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.930 
the box here says five to 99 i would say
that<00:04:03.120> age<00:04:03.419> five<00:04:03.780> may<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.500> too<00:04:04.980> young<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.519> grasp

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
that age five may be too young to grasp

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.360 
that age five may be too young to grasp
the<00:04:06.269> strategies<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.319> game<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:08.040> not<00:04:08.190> that

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
the strategies of the game it's not that

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.220 
the strategies of the game it's not that
difficult<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.880> play<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.480> game<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.660> roll<00:04:09.989> dice

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
difficult to play the game you roll dice

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.409 
difficult to play the game you roll dice
you<00:04:10.440> move<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.829> vampires<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:11.880> knowing<00:04:12.209> how<00:04:12.359> to

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
you move to vampires but knowing how to

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.330 
you move to vampires but knowing how to
move<00:04:12.660> your<00:04:12.690> vampire<00:04:13.380> into<00:04:13.560> better<00:04:13.769> positions

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
move your vampire into better positions

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.800 
move your vampire into better positions
actually<00:04:15.030> takes<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.269> little<00:04:15.419> bit<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.599> thought

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
actually takes a little bit of thought

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.990 
actually takes a little bit of thought
and<00:04:16.019> i<00:04:16.109> think<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.739> pretty<00:04:16.979> deep<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.700> kids

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
and i think this is pretty deep for kids

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.729 
and i think this is pretty deep for kids

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it comes to their color and then trying

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.650 
it comes to their color and then trying
