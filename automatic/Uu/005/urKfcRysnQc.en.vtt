00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.240 
actually comes down quite long on me
like<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.530> know<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.830> doesn't<00:03:25.100> sound

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
like I know that doesn't sound

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.070 
like I know that doesn't sound
believable<00:03:25.580> when<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.300> look<00:03:26.450> at<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.019> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
believable when you look at this and it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.870 
believable when you look at this and it
looks<00:03:27.320> just<00:03:27.410> literally<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> bralette<00:03:28.550> or

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
looks just literally like a bralette or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.690 
looks just literally like a bralette or
like<00:03:29.090> I'm<00:03:29.239> abend<00:03:30.230> oh<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.190> promise<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.670> guys

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.370 
like I'm abend oh but I promise you guys
like<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> actually<00:03:32.330> comes<00:03:32.690> down<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:33.110> full

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
like it actually comes down like a full

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.270 
like it actually comes down like a full
on<00:03:33.530> like<00:03:33.940> covering<00:03:34.940> everything<00:03:35.420> crop<00:03:35.989> top<00:03:36.280> so

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
on like covering everything crop top so

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.100 
on like covering everything crop top so
that's<00:03:37.730> why<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:37.880> really<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.630> really

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
that's why I really like it it's really

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.770 
that's why I really like it it's really
easy<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:40.100> match<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.489> with<00:03:40.640> other<00:03:40.820> clothing<00:03:41.330> and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
easy to match it with other clothing and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.910 
easy to match it with other clothing and
so

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.340 
so
I<00:03:43.240> can't<00:03:44.240> believe<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.540> looks<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.200> on

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
I can't believe that looks like that on
