00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.500
 greetings a hammer blow for everyone at 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.020
 titan hammer back the world of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.690
 minecraft to bring you a way with the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.240
 which are we going to give utility to an object 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 very forgotten as is the grass put 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.540
 that with magic lover we are going to get 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.510
 these magic clovers that you see here in 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.150
 my hand and to get it we are going to have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.950
 to remove all this grass that we have 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 here around since there's 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.450
 possibility that these three of us 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.789
 goals with which we will be able to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 get different items items and 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.670
 blocks 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.460
 how it works good first of all it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.160
 You can use it as food, you can see that 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.910
 here on the feed list well the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.920
 shamrock and we would fill three of the hunger and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.309
 obviously to achieve it we have to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.830
 chop all this grass I'm going to put the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.260
 survival mode so you can see it 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.809
 as I have the inventory one then nothing 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.089
 we started here to take everything crazy 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.510
 Look herbs we find there 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.000
 fallen one now I have two and when I give 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.690
 six more right click has possibility 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.550
 of spoiling an object you have seen 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.130
 how he just released a disc or that 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.380
 jump also a a clippers with which 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.790
 you have to be a little careful I go 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.520
 to put in creative mode so that I do not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.450
 I spent it and well you see that here it comes out 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.440
 an egg here comes a snow one 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.560
 apple another disc a carrot a cube 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.590
 of lava 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.610
 an experience position and a lighthouse 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.740
 this one has a weird drop, there are some 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.280
 which are blocked as for example 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.250
 the lava and water blocks like 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.369
 the blocks of commands the blocks of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.700
 base stone and some others and also 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.250
 there are others who have a weird 3 like 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.460
 example the lighthouse the star of the neider 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.830
 the dragon egg in also 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.420
 diamond tools the armor of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.209
 diamond of diamond blocks and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.100
 gold and so on, good because of giving 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.140
 with a right click you can see that he threw a 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.269
 lots of different things 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 obviously each one would be a clover with 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.269
 which we would have to remove a lot 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.720
 a lot of grass but I would really give it a 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.910
 utility and possibility also though 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.380
 now you're leaving me Liar 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.690
 that a creeper comes out waiting for 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.220
 see if it comes out at once 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.680
 more more more more more more more more there finally 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.880
 to live as a kripper has come but 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.700
 we go happens infrequently but 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.370
 since it happens I would recommend that what 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.220
 do here in a dispenser you put 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.100
 the lever you put inside the clover and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.450
 it also works, you see how you have thrown 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.370
 the wood right now is empty but if 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.310
 we will continue giving it because it would be releasing 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.980
 things and if it were a clipper then 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.140
 we could activate it from further away by 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.430
 example from here and then I do not know 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.060
 it would come to us and it would not explode 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.830
 directly 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.830
 one is getting dark and doing 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.950
 by day and nothing is a curious way of 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.510
 give a utility to the herb that almost not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.599
 we use it practically for nothing 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.700
 to get lots of objects one 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.830
 with a higher percentage than others here in 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 the video and in the description I'm going to 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.569
 put full accomplished of the banned 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.630
 of those who are blocked and those who 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.959
 they have a weird drone is looking bad 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.000
 this kripper and that list anyway 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.220
 can be modified 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.920
 I'm going to teach how we would have to 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.360
 go here to percentage app data 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.860
 percentage and within minecraft config 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.280
 we look for the magic lover mode file 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.540
 We open it with notepad I 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.730
 I have already put to open it with the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.470
 notebook directly and here you 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.130
 you see that there is the list of the banned 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.720
 which they are quite rare and if 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.209
 you want some to stop being weird and 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.160
 have a normal drop or stop 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.130
 be blocked because it would be a matter of 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.320
 delete the corresponding line and ready 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.300
 we go with the installation 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.480
 as always they recommend making a 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.120
 clean installation from scratch therefore 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.790
 we go here to percentage app data 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.370
 percentage and the contents of the folder 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.520
 from minecraft well we selected everything 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.860
 and we move it to another route or the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.170
 folder itself from minecraft we change the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.750
 name to do the installation in a 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.200
 empty the next thing would be to run the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.200
 launcher 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.920
 we give you here there is did profile for 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.380
 install the version that I want 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.330
 was to have the 17 10 is also 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.620
 they paid a 72 and for the 16 x 162 164 well 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.890
 that for example I'm going to teach him with 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.470
 172 since it's the same with all we give to 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.200
 6 profile and we give the play button to 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.920
 install the necessary files 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.980
 Then I will know the game 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.080
 and close them now we will install 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.700
 I force I have here all versions 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.570
 recommended from 16 February to October 17 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.030
 so we are going to install the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.200
 corresponding that is the 172 thousand 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.980
 121 the ends here and we click 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.390
 right to open with java platform the 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.400
 installation path is the same as the 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.650
 by default so we give it to 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.850
 accept and install the files of 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.200
 Forge we give you to accept again and 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.350
 now we go back again to execute the 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.170
 launcher to choose the new profile 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.930
 that has been created here from forge we give 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.590
 a deep profile and we check that there is 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.020
 release 172 for force 1.121 or the one 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.270
 correspond we give you to follow we give 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.100
 to the play button and once it goes back to 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.650
 open the game we close it again 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.410
 and now let's install the mode me here 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.410
 I have it for about 62 for about 64 and 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.710
 for 17 x this works so much for a 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.680
 272 as for the 17 10 as you see are 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.080
 hard files me when I upload it I'm going 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.500
 to compress although I have also 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.290
 checked that if these files the 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.940
 we put point zip so hard dot point 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.160
 zip 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.160
 let's say that inside I would have all the 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.780
 files as if it were a normal zip and 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.270
 works exactly the same without having to 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.560
 unzip them so from 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.160
 now surely I will go up 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:49.030
 so that you do not have problems of the 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.430
 three points heart point cip and then 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.160
 now we would choose the corresponding one that 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.960
 it would be the 27 x we ​​are going here to 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:02.009
 percentage app data percentage 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.150
 and inside minecraft bots we paste it 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:08.200
 we open the launcher once more 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:11.110
 and we run the game 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.080
 and here are the many here are the 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.520
 of fort and here is magic lovers with what 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.460
 which will give us no problem 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.889
 you see that it can also be from the 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.000
 form is point hard zip point so 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.949
 when there were them although you see 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.050
 compressed you do not have to 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.970
 unzip or anything I spend to 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.979
 dallara and subscribe and do not forget 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.979
 share the videos see you
