00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.010
 still that considering the conditions I find that one really makes one for me 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.420
 think it's not obvious the conditions when we have to start the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 match on the ice 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.519
 thank you in 2000 the price among the pros 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.679
 we do not have his 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.310
 the opponent's game 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.390
 then what was asked by% by the coach 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.070
 but I think we accomplished the mission today was the most 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.399
 two things here for the sire 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.380
 but I think they did it so 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 bonus strides for us 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.239
 he had told the press to leave 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.280
 wipro in the given direction to position itself note of the postponements of this 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.320
 she tears 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.400
 we are waiting to see this expo at afp fada applicable in the streets however 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.580
 beyond sales through his meals is offered to the self subscriber a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.160
 responsible for the disorders of the points and we made this evening to caen a series 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.270
 attacks against 3 rd place so 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.820
 with immediate support is to go to the 7th Middle East of 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.810
 dordogne was excellent state of freshness at 4 pm is ready for 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.250
 populations even with few duels we are ready in the former USSR 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 we did our job because it's won 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 and of course we hoped that zenith and win too and they are made 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.390
 this is Latin you have the arrests in europa league it's good 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.799
 not too difficult to play on a surface like that we saw you in particular 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.640
 dropped at the time of closing 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.680
 in fact it was sometimes difficult especially to watch it at 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.390
 hamon but hey 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.460
 for ourselves 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.640
 but play a little with the long time with so many sectors 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.220
 but we did it very well we were very present already a pendulum 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.510
 leaving her husband today we can not match the zenith gained in 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.360
 more marked 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.130
 we are the most important that you take 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.090
 convoy 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.660
 a little chain that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.030
 we were too difficult to play on a field like that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.540
 sometimes it's 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 with a word - quality instead of the expected 8% that 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.990
 everyone knows of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.650
 it's his best you see we win 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.720
 to unexpected city this thinker 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.670
 to see the result from the other side because 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.920
 we knew club in athens had everything in hand to qualify so 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.839
 in height we remain dependent on a visit to the bar 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.039
 and finally it is true that with the good tone in our favor I am especially 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.789
 glad we actually did the worker ourselves first 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.299
 did a very good game in hand 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.080
 on a rather delicate surface so that it was very positive this on 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.079
 what 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.719
 in two games it went really bad otherwise we could finish more 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.429
 points 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.509
 a homo if not% 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:44.369
 no for the next next tournament we know we're going out and a team 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.779
 who lives who was third in chain sic be a team that has finished 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.449
 first of his behavior 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.459
 it will be a client for sure I think the last one would not have been 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.209
 all the easier with bilbao in the round of 16 it had gone well so 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.099
 no matter I hope it will be a beautiful poster 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.749
 like without this report will be very motivated to move on 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:02.529
