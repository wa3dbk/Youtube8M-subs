directions<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.949> making<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:06.799> mixing<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
directions for making the mixing the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.700 
directions for making the mixing the
Pope<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> did<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
Pope for this but what I did is I just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.320 
Pope for this but what I did is I just
put<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> stove<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.920> mix<00:01:16.920> some<00:01:17.330> sugar

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
put it on the stove and mix some sugar

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
put it on the stove and mix some sugar
in<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:18.990> found<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> sugar<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> good

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in which i found out sugar is not a good

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.910 
in which i found out sugar is not a good
thing<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.000> fruit<00:01:21.479> leather

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
thing to use for fruit leather

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.140 
thing to use for fruit leather
supposedly<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.430> makes<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> brittle

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
supposedly because it makes it brittle

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
supposedly because it makes it brittle
and<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> mixed<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and then I mixed in a little bit of

and then I mixed in a little bit of
honey<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.390> took<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> had<00:01:29.400> two

hours at about 140 degrees and this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.670 
hours at about 140 degrees and this is
what<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> ended<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.439> fruit<00:01:58.439> leather

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
what I ended up with fruit leather

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.889 
what I ended up with fruit leather
pretty<00:01:59.430> neat<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.780> good

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
pretty neat it's actually really good

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
pretty neat it's actually really good
too<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.070> even<00:02:02.369> though<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> added<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.210> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
too and even though I added all that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.740 
too and even though I added all that
sugar<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.700> honey

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.890 

it's<00:02:09.750> still<00:02:10.259> pretty<00:02:10.500> tart<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.690> guess<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's still pretty tart I guess the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's still pretty tart I guess the
autumn<00:02:13.260> berries<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:15.060> different<00:02:15.510> levels<00:02:15.660> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
autumn berries have different levels of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.010 
autumn berries have different levels of
tartness<00:02:16.260> from<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:17.580> bush<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> next<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
tartness from one bush to the next and I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.100 
tartness from one bush to the next and I
wasn't<00:02:19.980> too<00:02:20.100> particular<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
wasn't too particular a lot of the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.100 
wasn't too particular a lot of the
berries<00:02:22.440> i<00:02:22.590> picked<00:02:22.890> weren't<00:02:23.310> entirely<00:02:24.110> fully

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
berries i picked weren't entirely fully

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.820 
berries i picked weren't entirely fully
ripe<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:25.890> were<00:02:25.950> tart<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> begin<00:02:26.700> with<00:02:27.830> mmm

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
ripe so they were tart to begin with mmm

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.770 
ripe so they were tart to begin with mmm
but<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.250> real<00:02:29.430> good<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:35.330> good<00:02:36.330> easy<00:02:36.540> way<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
but it's real good and good easy way to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.670 
but it's real good and good easy way to
preserve<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:38.180> stops<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.450> good<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.410> batch

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
preserve it stops really good this batch

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
it's a real sunny day so this should dry

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.630 
it's a real sunny day so this should dry
fairly<00:03:25.049> quick<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.680> windy<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
humidity's down but I just took the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.600 
humidity's down but I just took the
halfcourt<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.459> hope<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.850> had<00:03:32.880> left<00:03:33.720> over<00:03:34.110> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
halfcourt of hope I had left over and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.350 
halfcourt of hope I had left over and
spread<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.640> out<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.549> 10<00:03:39.120> x

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
spread it out on this it's like a 10 x

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.020 
spread it out on this it's like a 10 x
14<00:03:39.420> or<00:03:40.350> 10<00:03:40.560> x<00:03:40.709> 16<00:03:41.250> pan<00:03:42.200> on<00:03:43.200> some<00:03:44.070> wax<00:03:44.280> paper<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
14 or 10 x 16 pan on some wax paper and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.300 
14 or 10 x 16 pan on some wax paper and
i'm<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.049> letting<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.500> dry<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.070> Sun

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
i'm just letting this dry in the Sun

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.940 
i'm just letting this dry in the Sun
naturally<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.390> I've<00:03:49.260> got<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.650> little

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
naturally and I've got this little

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.770 
naturally and I've got this little
screen<00:03:50.280> over<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> keep<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.269> bugs<00:03:51.510> from

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
screen over it to keep the bugs from

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.530 
screen over it to keep the bugs from
getting<00:03:52.140> at<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.030> seems<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.329> be<00:03:54.390> working

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
getting at it and it seems to be working

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.229 
getting at it and it seems to be working
pretty<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.410> actually<00:03:56.370> put<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.970> out

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
pretty good I actually put this out

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.039 
pretty good I actually put this out
yesterday<00:03:58.079> at<00:03:58.260> about<00:03:59.420> seven<00:04:00.420> o'clock<00:04:00.510> at

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
yesterday at about seven o'clock at

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.699 
yesterday at about seven o'clock at
night<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.880> let<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.239> sit<00:04:03.480> overnight<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:06.709> now

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
night and I let it sit overnight and now

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.440 
night and I let it sit overnight and now
here<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.190> today<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:09.000> about<00:04:09.150> one<00:04:10.079> o'clock

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
here it is today it's about one o'clock

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.729 
here it is today it's about one o'clock
and<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.440> looks<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.709> it's<00:04:14.500> getting<00:04:15.500> pretty

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
and it looks like it's getting pretty

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.400 
and it looks like it's getting pretty
close<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.280> being<00:04:16.310> done<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.959> only<00:04:18.200> difference

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
close to being done the only difference

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.009 
close to being done the only difference
between<00:04:18.769> using<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.639> raw<00:04:19.790> pulp<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.540> cooking

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
between using the raw pulp and cooking

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.710 
between using the raw pulp and cooking
it<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:24.200> raw<00:04:24.380> pulp<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:25.010> harder<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.030> spread<00:04:26.510> out

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
it the raw pulp is harder to spread out

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.680 
it the raw pulp is harder to spread out
nice<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.020> even<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.610> once<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.940> cook<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.270> it

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
nice and even but once you cook it it

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.320 
nice and even but once you cook it it
sort<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.530> dissolves<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.520> pours<00:04:31.880> right<00:04:32.120> out

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
sort of dissolves and it pours right out

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.200 
sort of dissolves and it pours right out
like<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.570> liquid<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.350> it's<00:04:34.250> kind<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.639> easier<00:04:35.090> to

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
like a liquid so it's kind of easier to

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.600 
like a liquid so it's kind of easier to
pour<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.660> fruit<00:04:35.900> leather<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:37.100> get<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> nice

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
pour the fruit leather and get a nice

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.860 
pour the fruit leather and get a nice
even<00:04:37.820> layer<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:38.720> at<00:04:39.530> least<00:04:39.590> bring<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
even layer if you at least bring it to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.510 
even layer if you at least bring it to
just<00:04:41.870> bring<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.229> a<00:04:42.380> boil<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.979> set<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.400> off

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
just bring it to a boil and set it off

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.400 
just bring it to a boil and set it off
the<00:04:43.700> heat<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.590> breaks<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.130> down<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:47.229> makes<00:04:48.229> it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
the heat it breaks it down and makes it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.920 
the heat it breaks it down and makes it
a<00:04:48.470> lot<00:04:48.620> easier<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:49.190> pour<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.550> out<00:04:49.900> but<00:04:50.900> I

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
a lot easier to pour it out but I

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.360 
a lot easier to pour it out but I
figured<00:04:51.290> I'd<00:04:51.410> try<00:04:51.650> two<00:04:51.710> different<00:04:51.919> methods

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
figured I'd try two different methods

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.240 
figured I'd try two different methods
and<00:04:52.790> see<00:04:53.000> what<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.080> difference<00:04:54.470> was<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.010> this

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
and see what the difference was and this

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.840 
and see what the difference was and this
here<00:04:55.490> doesn't<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:55.970> any<00:04:56.150> sugar<00:04:56.479> added<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.430> it

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
here doesn't have any sugar added so it

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.690 
here doesn't have any sugar added so it
should<00:04:59.120> be<00:04:59.150> pretty<00:04:59.300> tart<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:01.250> that's<00:05:01.460> about

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
should be pretty tart but that's about

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:10.330 
should be pretty tart but that's about
it<00:05:01.760> i<00:05:04.450> think<00:05:05.450> i<00:05:05.510> spent<00:05:05.840> about<00:05:07.000> maybe<00:05:09.040> well<00:05:10.040> if

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
it i think i spent about maybe well if

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.150 
it i think i spent about maybe well if
you<00:05:10.490> want<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:10.910> fight<00:05:11.900> about<00:05:11.930> three<00:05:12.410> hours<00:05:12.620> four

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
you want to fight about three hours four

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.610 
you want to fight about three hours four
hours<00:05:13.190> total<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:15.650> i<00:05:15.740> started<00:05:16.190> out<00:05:16.340> with<00:05:16.550> about
