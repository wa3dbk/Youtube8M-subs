reason<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.179> just<00:00:51.390> wonder<00:00:51.750> what

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
reason for that and I just wonder what

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.799

happened<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.940> weird<00:00:54.149> chemical

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
happened here I got some weird chemical

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
happened here I got some weird chemical
reaction<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:56.910> sure

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
reaction that's right and I'm not sure

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.770 
reaction that's right and I'm not sure
if<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> ginger<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
if it's because of the ginger or a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.239 
if it's because of the ginger or a
certain<00:01:00.780> type<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> garlic<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.679> the<00:01:01.829> iron<00:01:02.010> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the green garlic and I looked this up

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
the green garlic and I looked this up
it's<00:01:31.830> green<00:01:32.100> blue<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.730> looks<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.140> swimming

pool<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.710> mean<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.580> bright<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
pool I mean it's really bright you

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.210 
pool I mean it's really bright you
didn't<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.410> clearly<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> picture

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
didn't see it so clearly in the picture

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.430 
didn't see it so clearly in the picture
but<00:01:38.370> boy<00:01:38.580> when<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.480> see<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.900> real<00:01:40.110> life<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
but boy when you see it in real life you

but boy when you see it in real life you
go<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.830> not<00:01:40.980> normal<00:01:41.580> this<00:01:42.120> isn't<00:01:42.330> food

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
go this is not normal this isn't food

go this is not normal this isn't food
color<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.660> there's<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.140> reason<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
color but it is there's a reason for it

color but it is there's a reason for it
and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.250> looked<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.700> looked<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and I looked it up so I looked it up on

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
and I looked it up so I looked it up on
the<00:01:51.030> internet<00:01:51.300> yes<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:52.050> quite<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.250> know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the internet yes it's quite it is a know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.540 
the internet yes it's quite it is a know
one<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> doesn't<00:01:54.150> happen<00:01:54.300> very<00:01:54.480> often

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
one thing it doesn't happen very often

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.090 
one thing it doesn't happen very often
but<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.610> Gulf<00:01:57.330> garlic<00:01:58.170> contains<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.860> says

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but it Gulf garlic contains it says

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
but it Gulf garlic contains it says
certain<00:01:59.520> sulfur<00:01:59.940> compounds<00:02:00.450> which<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.780> react

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
certain sulfur compounds which can react

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.190 
certain sulfur compounds which can react
with<00:02:01.350> copper<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.400> form<00:02:02.700> copper<00:02:02.910> sulfate<00:02:03.540> which

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
with copper to form copper sulfate which

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.750 
with copper to form copper sulfate which
if<00:02:04.380> you've<00:02:04.530> ever<00:02:04.680> seen<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.550> nice

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
if you've ever seen it is a really nice

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.580 
if you've ever seen it is a really nice
bright<00:02:06.150> green<00:02:06.420> blue<00:02:07.160> crystal<00:02:09.229> blue<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.349> green

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bright green blue crystal blue or green

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.619 
bright green blue crystal blue or green
and<00:02:10.830> compound<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> compa<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.390> amount

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
and compound this is compa this amount

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.000 
and compound this is compa this amount
of<00:02:12.720> copper<00:02:13.080> needed<00:02:13.319> for<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.500> reaction<00:02:13.920> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
of copper needed for this reaction is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.589 
of copper needed for this reaction is
very<00:02:14.250> small<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.910> frequently<00:02:15.269> found<00:02:15.450> in

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
very small and it's frequently found in

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.150 
very small and it's frequently found in
normal<00:02:16.019> water<00:02:16.470> supplies<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> used<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
normal water supplies but I used I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
normal water supplies but I used I
didn't<00:02:20.160> use<00:02:20.280> any<00:02:20.430> water<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.510> wasn't<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
didn't use any water so it wasn't the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.220 
didn't use any water so it wasn't the
water

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
water

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.520 
water
I<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:22.769> olive<00:02:23.040> oil<00:02:23.189> in<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.579> put<00:02:23.849> onions<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
I had olive oil in there I put onions in

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.680 
I had olive oil in there I put onions in
garlic<00:02:25.760> ginger<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
garlic ginger and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
garlic ginger and
lemon<00:02:28.140> juice<00:02:28.190> okay<00:02:29.190> now<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:29.490> important

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
lemon juice okay now that's important

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.320 
lemon juice okay now that's important
because<00:02:30.260> listen<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:32.120> raw<00:02:33.120> garlic

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
because listen to this raw garlic

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
because listen to this raw garlic

blue copper sulfate the garlic is still
safe<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> eat<00:02:45.800> now<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.220> don't<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:47.940> came

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
safe to eat now I don't think it came

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.570 
safe to eat now I don't think it came
from<00:02:48.150> my<00:02:48.360> utensils<00:02:48.930> because<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.340> cast

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
from my utensils because it's a cast

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.250 
from my utensils because it's a cast

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
presence of acid acid what did I put in

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.140 
presence of acid acid what did I put in
there<00:03:02.940> lemon<00:03:03.690> juice<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:04.670> put<00:03:05.670> some<00:03:05.820> lemon<00:03:06.000> juice

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
there lemon juice I put some lemon juice

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.790 
there lemon juice I put some lemon juice
in<00:03:06.420> because<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.660> had<00:03:06.780> lots<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.320> wanted<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
in because I had lots of it I wanted to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.980 
in because I had lots of it I wanted to
use<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.100> before<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.430> goes<00:03:08.550> bad<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.150> dumped

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
use it before it goes bad so I dumped

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.100 
use it before it goes bad so I dumped
some<00:03:10.050> into<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.590> frying<00:03:10.830> pan<00:03:11.100> with<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:12.110> onions

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
some into the frying pan with the onions

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
some into the frying pan with the onions
and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.980> when<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> put<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> garlic<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and then when I put the garlic in the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.390 
and then when I put the garlic in the
acid<00:03:16.910> cause<00:03:17.910> started<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> reaction<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:20.070> still

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
acid cause started the reaction it still

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.830 
acid cause started the reaction it still
could<00:03:20.580> be<00:03:20.640> dependent<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.300> garlic<00:03:21.660> maybe

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
could be dependent on the garlic maybe

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.470 
could be dependent on the garlic maybe
this<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.260> Chinese<00:03:22.620> garlic<00:03:23.010> maybe<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:24.210> threw

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
this is Chinese garlic maybe they threw

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.180 
this is Chinese garlic maybe they threw
a<00:03:24.510> bunch<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> heavy<00:03:25.200> metal<00:03:25.590> waste<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:25.950> their

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
a bunch of heavy metal waste in their

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.530 
a bunch of heavy metal waste in their
soil<00:03:26.520> right<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.210> don't<00:03:27.690> know

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
soil right I don't know

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.300 
soil right I don't know
so<00:03:30.540> maybe<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.050> was<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.290> particular<00:03:31.890> garlic

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so maybe it was that particular garlic

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070 
so maybe it was that particular garlic
that<00:03:32.430> had<00:03:32.610> some<00:03:32.790> copper<00:03:33.270> at<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.720> then<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
that had some copper at and then the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.870 
that had some copper at and then the
acid<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.590> went<00:03:34.770> in<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.370> chemical<00:03:35.820> reaction

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
acid just went in a chemical reaction

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.750 
acid just went in a chemical reaction
took<00:03:36.420> place<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.080> boom<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.340> first<00:03:38.550> time

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
took place and boom for the first time

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.479

somewhere<00:04:17.940> else<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:21.860> so<00:04:22.860> anyway<00:04:23.190> that's<00:04:23.550> it

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
somewhere else and so anyway that's it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.030 
somewhere else and so anyway that's it
so<00:04:24.060> there's<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> chemical<00:04:24.720> reason<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.830> can

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
so there's a chemical reason it can

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.300 
so there's a chemical reason it can
happen<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:27.690> might<00:04:28.470> try<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.770> again<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:29.100> might

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
happen I I might try it again I might

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.890 
happen I I might try it again I might
try<00:04:29.520> putting<00:04:29.580> some<00:04:29.850> lemon<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.630> see<00:04:30.810> if

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
try putting some lemon in just to see if

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.810 
try putting some lemon in just to see if
I<00:04:30.960> can<00:04:31.110> reproduce<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.950> experiment<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:32.669> it's

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
I can reproduce the experiment but it's

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.000 
I can reproduce the experiment but it's
kind<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.210> weird<00:04:33.390> when<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.840> want<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.620> serve<00:04:34.860> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
kind of weird when you want to serve it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.250 
kind of weird when you want to serve it
to<00:04:35.190> somebody<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:36.180> says<00:04:36.419> what<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.080> this

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
to somebody and it says what is this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.770 
to somebody and it says what is this
blue-green<00:04:37.800> food<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.430> my<00:04:38.580> plate

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
blue-green food and my plate

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.240 
blue-green food and my plate
um<00:04:39.900> but<00:04:40.770> anyway<00:04:40.800> that's<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.490> mystery<00:04:42.330> solved

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
um but anyway that's the mystery solved

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.340 
um but anyway that's the mystery solved
thanks<00:04:44.250> for<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.550> Internet<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.770> that's<00:04:47.160> it
