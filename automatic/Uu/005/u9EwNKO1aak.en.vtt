00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
like a week week or two so that kind of

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.380 
like a week week or two so that kind of
sucks<00:06:57.160> I<00:06:57.430> mean<00:06:57.580> that<00:06:57.880> means<00:06:58.060> i<00:06:58.120> have<00:06:58.150> to<00:06:58.240> get<00:06:58.330> a

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
sucks I mean that means i have to get a

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.530 
sucks I mean that means i have to get a
whole<00:06:58.600> 99<00:06:59.020> again<00:06:59.350> but<00:06:59.920> I<00:07:00.190> guess<00:07:01.090> it'll<00:07:01.240> give<00:07:01.420> me

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
whole 99 again but I guess it'll give me

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.890 
whole 99 again but I guess it'll give me
more<00:07:01.570> playtime<00:07:02.140> and<00:07:02.380> just<00:07:03.280> stuff<00:07:03.460> to<00:07:03.610> do

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
more playtime and just stuff to do

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.240 
more playtime and just stuff to do
because<00:07:04.900> once<00:07:05.050> i'm<00:07:05.230> near<00:07:05.470> and<00:07:05.620> max<00:07:05.830> there's

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
because once i'm near and max there's

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.190 
because once i'm near and max there's
probably<00:07:06.940> not<00:07:07.150> much<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.510> can<00:07:07.570> do<00:07:07.750> in<00:07:07.900> this<00:07:07.990> game
