00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.800
 product or multiplication of numbers 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.059
 natural property uniform and laws of 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.990
 monotony multiplying member member 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.850
 two or more equalities you get another 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:31.480
 equality symbolically being equal ab 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:37.210
 equals y is equal to efe a orce x 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.899
 it is equal to order by efe the product 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.949
 of natural numbers always exists and it is 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 only this implies that multiplying 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.370
 equal numbers you get the same 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.809
 result to this property is the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.229
 The following property is called uniform property 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.409
 law indicates multiplying member to 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.350
 member two or more inequalities of 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.020
 same sense you get another 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.220
 inequality 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.780
 same sense as that of the fairies 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:19.340
 in symbols if a is greater than bc greater 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:25.220
 that of and in greater than fa por c por e 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:30.350
 It will also be more you see of by f 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.260
 also if m is less than in ip it is less 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.980
 that qm for p will be less an for q 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.990
 as a numerical example we put if 10 is 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:50.540
 greater than 25 is greater than 3 and 6 is greater 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.770
 than 4 when making the products 10 by 5 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:00.230
 by 6 will be greater than two by three 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:04.450
 four indeed 300 is greater than 24 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:10.369
 as an example for the case of less than 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 being 2 less than 8 and 3 less than 5 2 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.100
 by 3 it will be less than 8 by 5 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.340
 effectively 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.150
 6 is less than 40 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 the next law indicates multiplying 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.470
 member to member inequalities 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.160
 same sense with equalities you get 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.580
 another inequality in the same sense as 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.220
 the one of the given ones 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:47.290
 being greater than b equals greater 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:52.320
 that f to porsche by will be greater than b 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:57.330
 order by efe also being equal to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:02.230
 c less than and less than f 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.960
 will result to porsche by the minor you see 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.330
 by by f 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.130
 these properties or laws refer to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.150
 inequalities and inequalities with 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.120
 Equalities are called monotony because 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.930
 the result maintains the sense of 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.930
 inequality
