 jeb french manufacturer specialist 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 sealing and maintenance in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 sanitary plumbing heating offers 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.000
 a range for the maintenance of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
 air conditioning heating systems 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.690
 and hot water for descaling 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.690
 a sanitary hot water system 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 leuthard lends a major problem in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.430
 domestic hot water installations 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 he is responsible for the damage 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.490
 fast equipment or even breakdowns 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.960
 and a reduction in the flow of hot water 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 jeb offers a complete range of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.180
 descaling the descaler g60 for the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.620
 descaling of resistors small 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 streamers and small water balloons 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 hot the g60 is a tartar years 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.489
 uses with descaling pump for the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250
 descaling water balloon coils 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.110
 hotter of greater capacity 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 the 62 descaling agent express for a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 quick descaling in less than 20 minutes 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 and with its formula compatible all 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.030
 metals there tartar all types 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.340
 sanitary hot water installations 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 the 63 descaler powder a formula 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 Powder compatible all metals having 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 food compatibility 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.379
 let's take the example of descaling a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.519
 boiler scale focus 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.770
 basically in the exchanger 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.939
 start by emptying the connected exchanger 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.420
 the pump on the inputs and outputs 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420
 water 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 fill the tank of the pump to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.340
 descale with a liter of descaling agent 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.640
 for a liter of water put the pump in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.470
 walk when the solution becomes brown 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 it is saturated renewed then 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.430
 the operation 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.760
 when there are no more bubbles at reflux 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.960
 the operation is complete 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.600
 in the case of descaling powder 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.210
 prepare the solution with about 2.5 to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.740
 10% of powder in the water attention it 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 Always put the descaling agent in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.750
 water and not the inverted 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.280
 at the end of the descaling rinse with the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.030
 neutralizing to suppress acidity 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.620
 residual treatment of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.240
 installations thanks to descalers jeb 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.010
 helps reduce the breakage of 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.930
 equipment restore the performance of 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.030
 facilities and therefore reduce the bill 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.490
 energetic and finally found a flow 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.750
 of hot water so they are 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.750
 available in different formats 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.190
 I like the plumber's partner 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.850
 heating engineer since 1860 accompanies you 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 on your sites
