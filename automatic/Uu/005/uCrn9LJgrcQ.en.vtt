00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to get them both before and I just like

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.300 
to get them both before and I just like
thought<00:00:25.230> I'd<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.859> only<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.039> couple<00:00:26.160> of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
thought I'd do it was only a couple of

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
thought I'd do it was only a couple of
greed<00:00:26.670> kills<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> needed<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
greed kills that needed to get so and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
greed kills that needed to get so and
just<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:29.279> yeah<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.300> using

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
just at that I'm yeah we're using

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
just at that I'm yeah we're using
warlord<00:00:31.170> pro<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.500> future<00:00:31.890> new<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
warlord pro in future new and I think it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.700 
warlord pro in future new and I think it
only<00:00:32.969> gives<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.420> extra<00:00:33.660> tomahawks<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
only gives you an extra tomahawks are in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
only gives you an extra tomahawks are in
extra<00:00:35.100> sim<00:00:35.280> texts<00:00:35.640> until<00:00:35.790> he<00:00:36.030> finally<00:00:36.270> just

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
extra sim texts until he finally just

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.240 
extra sim texts until he finally just
