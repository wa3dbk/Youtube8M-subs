00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
this to be another right off but I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150 
this to be another right off but I
actually<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.660> product<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.410> don't<00:02:20.010> think

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
actually like this product I don't think

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040 
actually like this product I don't think
it's<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> bad<00:02:20.520> product<00:02:20.880> at<00:02:21.120> all<00:02:21.300> because<00:02:21.750> said

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's a bad product at all because said

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's a bad product at all because said
taste<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.340> strength<00:02:23.700> could<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.090> been<00:02:24.210> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
taste the strength could have been a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
taste the strength could have been a
little<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.870> better<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.410> mean<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
little bit better but I mean that's that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
little bit better but I mean that's that
can<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.550> factored<00:02:26.970> into<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.240> lot<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.600> things<00:02:27.780> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
can be factored into a lot of things but

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
can be factored into a lot of things but
you<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> found<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.400> strength<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.880> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
you know I found that strength is a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.040 
you know I found that strength is a
little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.240> better<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.600> other<00:02:30.780> pre

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
little bit better with other pre

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.660 
little bit better with other pre
workouts<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.709> i<00:02:31.800> said<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.100> pump<00:02:32.370> energy
