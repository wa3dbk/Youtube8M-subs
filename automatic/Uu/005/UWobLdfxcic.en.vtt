00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
run out of ammo a lot so you slap on the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.439 
run out of ammo a lot so you slap on the
rifle<00:00:22.230> ammo<00:00:22.560> mutation<00:00:23.189> mod<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.670> whenever<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

see shotgun ammo on the ground you can
pick<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.789> reduced<00:00:27.150> amount<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.720> will

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
pick it up at a reduced amount it will

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.500 
pick it up at a reduced amount it will
convert<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> into<00:00:28.619> rifle<00:00:29.490> ammo<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.480> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
convert it into rifle ammo so what I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.659

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you pick up that ammo normally you would

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760 
you pick up that ammo normally you would
get<00:00:34.739> twenty<00:00:35.160> twenty<00:00:35.820> bullets<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.380> normal
