00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.020
 dvd criticism today with another 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.760
 Documentation recommendation for one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 documentation currently in the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.250
 one or the other smaller cinema is running 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.940
 namely first position ballet is her 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
 Life 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.699
 that's an air gun that should be me 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 I guess you do not want to go now and that is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.760
 a pedestrian hurts very much that he is at 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.760
 rotate 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.120
 I have fun with the dancing loose 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.150
 but starting now it's so much 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.770
 more than that the people are not clear 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.330
 how difficult is it to eleven dancers too 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.070
 create 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 Children love their childhood request it 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.770
 never stops hurting 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.739
 so it seems your body up to 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.059
 Last five is persistence 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.590
 most important to be trusted 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:00.309
 you have to be your dream girlfriend for the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.379
 Men do not think that I am he never 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.610
 thought that my son will get better but 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.220
 I could not be prouder of him 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.440
 tips are very nice yes exactly I became 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.210
 in sierra leone in west africa 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.370
 my parents were from the rebels 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.500
 It's a miracle that I shot 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.690
 I'm here at all, I believe 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.520
 a pretty normal spitzname in 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.960
 the school is gabi because i am in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.780
 earn all possible directions 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.740
 if people say that i can not 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.420
 had childhood 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 but I think that's exactly what I am 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.409
 proper measure of childhood and ballet 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.900
 she had high to high to high 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.390
 i am from colombia i work for 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 my family my dream is that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.520
 professional ballet dancer to read 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.020
 so many dancers would like to be a career 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.270
 but make very few at least 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.710
 5000 m in the competition and then 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 only manage a few hundred new ones 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.270
 york it was awful 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.649
 you get five minutes on stage 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 and to prove why you have this chance 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.740
 would have 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.240
 his heart beats as fast as I am 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.240
 excited 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.880
 the dream of my life spent 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.769
 Persian ballet is your life 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.440
 is 98 minutes running since 4 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.330
 July 2013 in the German cinemas after 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.310
 pulls the story of many children and 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.530
 teenager the one above all one 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.879
 combines passion with ballet 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.349
 and then you could say 'oh my god' 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.840
 Ballet is interested in something 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.090
 in quotes sport or 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.860
 art art but that is not so in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.690
 this documentary film begins 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 Especially in the topic of dreams 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.319
 and aim at life in many things 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.209
 really great as well as far people too 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.830
 to their limits go to these 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.329
 so will the story of the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.459
 one or the other child such as 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.920
 erin or even just told the first 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.870
 19 11 years old but already dancing 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.430
 as if she were great masters of her craft 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.209
 and there you sit partly in kiel and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.430
 look at the canvas 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.599
 somehow you can move and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.400
 they are incredibly crass 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.049
 choreographies the captured great 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 accompanied by music and then always 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.069
 paired with the inner life of this again 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 people in their privacy to the 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.250
 The story of parents telling their children 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.599
 Goals look just as good on them 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.700
 story of a Colombian boy 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.470
 somehow it tries to get better 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.269
 world to gain a foothold at home where he 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.709
 there is no perspective for that 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.420
 story of a black adopted 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.190
 African media African 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.380
 the girl also tells the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.079
 great dream ballet has to dance and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.700
 also the story of a normal 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.410
 Student from the United States, you realize that 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.329
 you can come from many layers and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.130
 still dream the same dream and 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.000
 a great story you have to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 unfortunately we also say this 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.069
 documentation that is implemented great on 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.410
 The End 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.329
 when she almost found you a little bit too 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.639
 because we had just accompanied people 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.709
 somehow it's all around 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.299
 the end was a happy ending 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.069
 that seems almost unrealistic for 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.599
 your documentation is great 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.799
 So, ballet will be implemented 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.750
 should be interested in the film 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.579
 View anyway but for all these 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.109
 typical outsider stories or before 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.549
 All these live your dream 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.530
 like this is stories 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.900
 really enriching documentation 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.389
 fun is also relative to the 98 minutes 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.889
 entertaining the musical background and 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.989
 also leaves in the camera guide sometimes 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.609
 the picture just stand when you are in the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.630
 do not say just like that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.789
 inside of such a person 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.280
 can and always is a look 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.660
 partly also terrifying picture what 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 he delivers when, for example, the feet 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.710
 This dancer shows when every day 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.450
 10 12 14 hours and train them 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.260
 just look tortured and 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.670
 despite the biggest pain continue 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.740
 Of course there is also a border where you 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.510
 why do you do this on everyone 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.520
 case such a documentation can be a 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.050
 triggering a lot of conversation demand and 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.640
 Being beautiful at the same time 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.070
 the fire position for me pr 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.050
 technically much too unknown and unfortunately 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.460
 will still be able to sing in the cinema 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.900
 maybe even watch if 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.990
 interest in this direction heeker on 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.070
 The canvas is really fun 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.530
 Documentation do not get with me 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.580
 rating that's the way it is but hope 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.170
 that I am one or the other 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.760
 maybe a little bit of interest 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.930
 could at least wake up at least 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.540
 to watch if the movie on blu-ray 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.160
 comes out or dvd okay that was it now 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.100
 from me with my little revier too 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 first position ballet is your life 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.940
 let download let it stay 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.410
 when the shotgun last at the cinema 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.580
 reviews over or on twitter and 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.260
 facebook because I listen to movies 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.760
 but do not want to write this or 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.200
 my two channel if you have no videos 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.720
 Let's miss it if 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.880
 but that only decides here 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.980
 tomorrow is here at 15 o'clock later 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.540
 and his new video and hope so far 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.820
 I'll be back tomorrow 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.820
 of course at 3
