00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 plus 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.200
 Now let's do bench press flat 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.170
 he is the father of all the exercises of 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.210
 pectoral this exercise serves to 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.119
 increase volume and strength but 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.619
 we will focus on the volume 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.070
 one of the most important things to have 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.439
 in account is the placement of the hands 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.079
 by fixing your grip your hands your elbows and 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.910
 your shoulders should be aligned not 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.030
 you must be placed neither too close 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.670
 not too far if you put too much 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.920
 near you will load more your triceps if 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 you're too far away you 're going to put a lot 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.090
 load on your shoulders 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.370
 you must make sure that your wrists shoulders 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.519
 and elbows are aligned with each other 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.399
 maintaining the angle there are many errors 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.289
 typical in this exercise one of the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.480
 most common mistakes is bouncing the weight 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.670
 in the chest when lowering the bar 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.829
 this is something especially negative that 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.810
 you should avoid when you lower your elbows 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.220
 below the angle of the shoulders you are 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.520
 putting a lot of stress 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.200
 about them training in this way is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.820
 very possible that the only thing you will achieve 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.160
 over time, the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.070
 shoulders and your chest lends 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.180
 pay attention to it make sure it does not bounce 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.400
 the weight on your chest 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.050
 I've heard people say they want 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 feel the stretch of the chest to 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.500
 get down to our main goal 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.700
 is build muscle do not stretch 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.619
 make sure you keep the angle of the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 wrist of shoulders and elbows 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.340
 perfectly aligned to your body 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.340
 forming a square in the space of 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.050
 execution another advice that I want to give you 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.330
 is to pay close attention to the tempo 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.259
 the slower the execution of 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.210
 drop more myofibrils recruits how much 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.640
 faster go - myofibrils 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.390
 you will build how many more myofibrils 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.820
 recruits bigger muscle size you'll get 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 control the rhythm is very important 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.560
 activate the mind-body connection when 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.840
 lower the bar decreases the speed 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.750
 you must feel how the muscle contracts 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.280
 when you go down when you go up 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.510
 keep the contraction in the pectoral 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.430
 without blocking your elbows 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.610
 when you lock your elbows out 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.510
 your muscles stop being in tension 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.159
 make sure you do not lose tension 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 muscle and choose a load amount 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:28.310
 reasonable the heavier your load is 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.989
 harder to keep the tempo now I 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.390
 I'd like to show you how you should perform 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.610
 this exercise correctly 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.890
 Stay tuned first thing is the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 position keep the shoulders aligned and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.030
 Place your hips on the bench 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.859
 of training, keep in mind that in no 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 At the time of the exercise, you must lift your 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.569
 hips of the support bench when lifting 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 hips help you move the weight 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.069
 with the legs and they will also generate 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.750
 a lot of tension in your lower back is 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.909
 essential to keep the hips towards 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.190
 down supported on the bench and to stay 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.750
 slightly back when you have the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.220
 hands well positioned in the bar 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.810
 make sure you form a square 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.720
 when you lift the weight make sure 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.660
 you maintain control at the moment 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.160
 low the bar controls the speed 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.520
 align your elbows and bring the bar up 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.070
 approximately this height 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.000
 then the weight goes up without blocking 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.070
 your elbows go down very slowly keep 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.190
 the control of the execution places the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 chest up and tighten when climbing 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.270
 when you get to the top you will feel a 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.610
 small vibration in the charge I have a 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.380
 great control over my pectoral I maintain 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.350
 the tempo and I am able to control the 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.020
 load during the descent phase ensures 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.400
 to remember these basic concepts 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.260
 keep the tempo mind-body connection 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.560
 and control the movement to the end 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.150
 without blocking the elbows inhales when 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.640
 you are lowering the weight and open your box 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.560
 thoracic when reaching down exhale when going up 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.550
 without blocking the elbows and 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.550
 control the speed 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.510
 this is the proper and correct way of 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.920
 do the bench press exercise 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.780
 make sure to keep your hips flat 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.270
 supported on the bench and with a slight 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.959
 arch in the back do not forget to keep 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.790
 your shoulders elbows and wrists aligned 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.400
 you should not loosen your elbows or swing 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.799
 the front and back once 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.049
 find this angle keep it there not 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.900
 you must go down too much nor should you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.389
 climb too much you have to align your elbows 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.889
 the shoulders and wrists forming a 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.200
 square in the execution space 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.110
 control the tempo when you go down and exhale 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.580
 at the same time you're going up like this 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.880
 the bench press exercise is done 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.880
 flat
