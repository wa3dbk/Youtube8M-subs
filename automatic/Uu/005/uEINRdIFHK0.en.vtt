their<00:04:01.019> last<00:04:01.229> record<00:04:01.560> splatter<00:04:02.099> thrash<00:04:02.579> but

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
their last record splatter thrash but

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.569 
their last record splatter thrash but
they<00:04:03.659> also<00:04:04.049> refine<00:04:04.500> themselves<00:04:05.040> musically<00:04:05.549> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
they also refine themselves musically a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.670 
they also refine themselves musically a
bit<00:04:05.819> too<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.090> think<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.930> music<00:04:07.259> on<00:04:07.349> this<00:04:07.470> thing

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
bit too I think the music on this thing

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.699 
bit too I think the music on this thing
to<00:04:07.799> me<00:04:07.919> just<00:04:08.129> feels<00:04:08.340> less<00:04:08.879> chaotic<00:04:09.509> less<00:04:10.169> messy

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
to me just feels less chaotic less messy

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.469 
to me just feels less chaotic less messy
the<00:04:10.979> riffs<00:04:11.189> have<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.489> lot<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.699> muscle<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.180> them

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
the riffs have a lot of muscle to them

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.030 
the riffs have a lot of muscle to them
and<00:04:12.659> they're<00:04:12.780> really<00:04:13.199> catchy<00:04:13.470> because<00:04:13.889> these

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
and they're really catchy because these

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.390 
and they're really catchy because these
guys<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.519> hitting<00:04:14.639> great<00:04:15.209> grooves<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.500> even

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.499 
guys are hitting great grooves and even
though<00:04:17.489> these<00:04:17.669> riffs<00:04:17.909> are<00:04:18.150> pretty

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
though these riffs are pretty

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.749 
though these riffs are pretty
hard-hitting<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:20.159> a<00:04:20.250> lot<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.519> them<00:04:20.639> are

evened<00:04:21.120> out<00:04:21.239> because<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:22.079> guys<00:04:22.320> manage<00:04:22.830> to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
evened out because these guys manage to

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.480 
evened out because these guys manage to
