00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
back pretty much a simple way I didn't

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.610 
back pretty much a simple way I didn't
want<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.040> mess<00:04:07.190> with<00:04:07.340> all<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.670> wiring<00:04:08.470> not<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
want to mess with all the wiring not the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.610 
want to mess with all the wiring not the
trunks<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.700> stock<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.840> much<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.500> that's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
trunks the stock that much but that's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.410 
trunks the stock that much but that's
how<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.860> battery<00:04:13.280> fits<00:04:13.459> it's<00:04:13.760> bolted<00:04:14.120> down

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
how the battery fits it's bolted down

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.949 
how the battery fits it's bolted down
and<00:04:15.410> grounded<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.070> frame<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.930> a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
and grounded to the frame so this is a

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.890 
and grounded to the frame so this is a
view<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.680> pretty<00:04:19.130> much<00:04:19.359> what<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.389> had<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.660> do<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
view of pretty much what I had to do the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.909 
view of pretty much what I had to do the
fuel<00:04:21.200> tank

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
fuel tank

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:31.640

see<00:04:23.699> this

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.030 

right<00:04:32.130> here<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.639> can<00:04:32.759> fill<00:04:32.970> up

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
right here so you can fill up

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.879 
right here so you can fill up
we<00:04:35.100> got<00:04:35.250> rid<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.430> all<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.760> pressure<00:04:36.000> lines

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
we got rid of all the pressure lines

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.959 
we got rid of all the pressure lines
the<00:04:38.189> pressure<00:04:38.430> on<00:04:38.610> your<00:04:38.819> gas

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
the pressure on your gas

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.850 
the pressure on your gas
rounded<00:04:41.749> the<00:04:41.809> frame<00:04:42.079> right<00:04:42.319> there<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.769> it

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
rounded the frame right there and it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.550 
rounded the frame right there and it
goes

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
goes

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.620 
goes
in<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.860> bank

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
in the bank

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.320
