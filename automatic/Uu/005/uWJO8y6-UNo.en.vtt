 reported at the beginning of the year internet browser 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 explorer goes back a few 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 months ago we recall it became known 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 that romance corporation is developing 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 committed new web browser project 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 bears the code name spartan it will be 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870
 created from scratch the browser is not 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 a continuation of the internet series 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.410
 explorer for old sport sites he 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 will use sand internet 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.080
 explorer 11 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.369
 but in most cases he will 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 rely on much more efficient 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.899
 and fast rendering engine in conjunction with 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.190
 recycled foot java-script new 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.420
 the browser will become part of the operating 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.070
 windows 10 systems 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 the output of which is expected later in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 current year in terms of the spartan interface 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.860
 according to preliminary data will be 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 remind chrome and firefox browser 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 will get extension support besides 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.229
 Microsoft has determined this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.670
 with release lines of the final version 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.619
 newest windows 10 operating system 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 which can work on the most

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 the third quarter in july or august in 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.470

 seeks to fully windows 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860
 devices could be light and mobile 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.020
 but everyone provided

 official blog about innovations 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 allowed to significantly reduce 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.440
 occupied by windows 10 space on 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.360
 drive to achieve this 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.849
 windows 10 was about two separate 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.349
 independent approach first windows 10 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.870
 uses efficient compression algorithms 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.190
 system files second improvements 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.840
 made a recovery process 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.459
 operating system removed the need 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.440
 storing a special image of this 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.060
 case of system file compression like 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.709
 notes microsoft and already current 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.420
 Build the upcoming operating system 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.599
 frees up about a gigabyte and a half 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.640
 given for 32-bit windows 10 and 2 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.410
 with a half gigabyte for 64 bit 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.940
 smartphone systems will also be 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.920
 use a similar effective 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.660
 algorithm and compress about system data what 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.700
 will also release an impressive 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.870
 storage capacity for other needs is 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.970
 especially should please the owners 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.280
 entry level mobile phones on 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.569
 base windows phone 8 1 to compress 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.980
 no files affected noticeably 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.989
 responsiveness and performance 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.880
 windows device allows for row 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.040
 factors before activating opportunity 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.930
 First of all, we are talking about the amount of feedback 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.519
 the more memory the less often the device 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.560
 will have to download and unpack files 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.150
 from the drive second parameter speed

 work decompression algorithm on 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.200
 particular sepia appreciating these other 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.030
 important factors are windows and takes 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.769
 decision to use data compression 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.900
 which will not lead to a noticeable decrease 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.549
 operating system responsiveness with 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.170
 aim to attract the maximum amount 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.340
 users coming out in the summer 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.870
 windows 10 platforms 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.000
 microsoft will go to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.350
 unprecedented measures free versions 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 new operating system will be 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.850
 available to all song owners on 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.859
 base windows 7 or windows 8 and 1 including 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.540
 those who use pirated versions for now 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.799
 unknown whether the company is spread 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.510
 by free upgrade all 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.489
 current version of windows to windows 10 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.950
 but users around the world including 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.030
 Russian Federation new company plan 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.859
 much more radical 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.569
 he intends to provide licenses 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.370
 on windows 10 including users 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.590
 pirated versions of operating systems and in 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.269
 a world scale of which earlier microsoft 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.799
 just never actually did 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.299
 Microsoft is expected to be 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.609
 monetize your operating system 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.979
 sales of additional services and 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.450
 for business and individuals so company 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.590
 already provides a paid subscription to 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.330
 office suite 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.039
 and also trades communication 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.200
 skype programs and games 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.729
 considering that the opportunity to earn money 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.529
 windows 10 directly depends on 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.149
 platform prevalence 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.229
 for microsoft is extremely logical not only 

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.879
 distribute the operating system 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.289
 free for new devices 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.579
 but also provide about current 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.319
 users even if they are not 

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.719
 purchased legal copies of windows 7 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.609
 or 8 and 1 earlier in this way 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.169
 unprecedented action microsoft extremely 

00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:51.009
 it is logical and completely in the interests 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.989
 companies four months after 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.609
 launch android 50 google 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:55.839
 introduced the second version of lollipop 

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:57.579
 android 5 1 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.379
 although it is not a major update 

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:01.029
 but still brings a few 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.249
 significant changes other than minor 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.629
 improvements and improvements main plus new 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.759
 faster version at least on 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.769
 tablet background nexus 6 last was 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.139
 tested by employees to give away windows and 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:13.179
 after the upgrade platform android 5 1 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.279
 as the journalist notes and saved on x6 

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.749
 from many performance issues 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.609
 before the night 106 update is slower 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:21.009
 started the application and switched the task 

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:22.839
 like old nexus 5 on android 5 1 new 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.789
 the device works much faster and quite 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.679
 corresponds to the level of these indicators 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.539
 according to the famous third-party 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:30.279
 kernel developer android francisco 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.719
 free google now uses 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.089
 instruction is not it for speeding up 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.529
 encryption on nexus 6 performance 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.689
 can be further enhanced with 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.669
 hardware accelerated encryption but in on 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.319
 x6 i still no google though 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.279
 experimenting with this opportunity in
