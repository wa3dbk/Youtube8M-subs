00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.349
 chiropody caring for the feet of 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 children from the beginning of life 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.240
 gives us healthy feet but the feet are the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.340
 great forgotten and then we have 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.519
 problems with development and abuse 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.039
 to which we submit the few people 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.050
 sometimes they wear appropriate shoes and that 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.660
 makes statistics show that 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.940
 between 75 and 80 percent of the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.270
 adult population has some problem in 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.129
 the feet unfortunately often do not 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.040
 they seek advice on these problems 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.559
 until they are irreversible or very 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.480
 complicated to solve is obvious 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.149
 that the attention in the first years of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.920
 training is very important and can 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.739
 save many problems in the age 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.960
 adult the foot is a true wonder 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.879
 of biological engineering and its 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.579
 complexity can be understood 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.770
 perfectly we just have to think about 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.539
 the bones of the feet that represent 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.760
 one eighth of all the bones that there are in 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.189
 the body the foot is capable of propelling 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.259
 the body and protects it from blows 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.740
 mechanics and stresses throughout the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.869
 Foot early life development 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.990
 at the time of birth and during the first 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.060
 year or more or less of life the feet of 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.640
 Babies are very different in many 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.040
 aspects of those of an adult in the first 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 place they have a different way being 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.899
 wider at the front of the foot 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.689
 and narrow the fingers of the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.640
 feet are often curved in seconds 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.030
 instead the bones are not developed 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.909
 and in this stage consists of nothing but 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.640
 of a cartilage so they are soft and 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.979
 flexible this is the reason why 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.470
 young children can do things 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.190
 without your feet suffering any damage in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.020
 absolute the 26 bones of each foot are 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.569
 gradually develop throughout 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.780
 the first years coming to be 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.100
 basically bones at the age of 7 or 8 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.200
 years 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.619
 at this time the toes 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.440
 usually they have already straightened out 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.950
 However, they do not develop completely 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.709
 until the end of adolescence 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.630
 early attention of the feet is very 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.910
 important to let the baby's feet 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.850
 they develop in the most natural way 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.970
 possible the baby should be encouraged to walk 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.900
 barefoot at home and outdoors and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.209
 avoid the constrictions of clothing 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
 this way the muscles of the feet and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.890
 the legs will begin to strengthen and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.800
 will be ready for when you start 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.840
 walk the feet of babies and 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.890
 young children grow at a rate 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.860
 alarming why it's important to have in 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.380
 count the size of the socks 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.049
 shoes and in particular the garments of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.900
 one piece if these garments 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.000
 begin to look adjusted is necessary 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.880
 buy new ones so that the feet 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.950
 can grow without inhibitions in the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.120
 case of the pieces of clothing can be 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 cut 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.760
 first steps of the baby when the baby 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.310
 takes the first steps becomes a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.310
 great time for parents and no doubt 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.950
 it is also an achievement for the child as 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 father or mother must resist temptation 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.829
 of running out to buy the first 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.230
 pair of shoes the feet of the babies are 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.680
 plans and at this stage they are still 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.019
 designed to work barefoot do not 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.079
 must force a child to walk before 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.569
 of time they will do when they are ready and 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.480
 age varies a lot between babies 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.060
 first steps occur between 10 and 18 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.400
 months however they do even 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.549
 after this age it does not mean 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.799
 necessarily that something goes wrong 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.340
 first shoes in the early stages 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.489
 of walking the shoes are unnecessary 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.069
 in fact it is desirable to allow the baby 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.920
 walk barefoot and thus strengthen the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.930
 muscles of the feet obviously you have to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.940
 make sure there is nothing in the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.160
 soil that can damage the feet and 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.370
 ensure that the area is clean to 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.430
 minimize the risk 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.799
 infection once the baby is ready 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.070
 to go out protection of the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.709
 shoes it is necessary to buy a 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.919
 shoe of good quality with at least the 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.370
 leather tops make sure 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.650
 that the socks adapt too 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.199
 completely as stated before 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.900
 too tight will be restrictive and 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.479
 too loose could also cause 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.940
 problems always leaves a quantity 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.849
 reasonable space in footwear for 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.679
 the future operation 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.349
 at the feet of children are very 

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.969
 flexible and not too sensitive by 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.969
 what they often do not complain about 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.039
 pressure or friction zones therefore 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.100
 It is important to check your feet 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.220
 regularly 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.230
 common problems and anxieties of 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.480
 mothers often worry because their 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.760
 Baby seems to be walking with his feet 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.820
 plans in the early stages of 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.340
 development which is normal and gives them 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.220
 a more stable base so that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.200
 legs and feet are strengthened if the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.720
 flat foot seems to persist in a child 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.390
 small and apparently is causing 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.490
 problems consult a podiatrist who 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.100
 will be able to advise if they could 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.950
 need appropriate exercises or 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.980
 corrective templates if your child seems 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.750
 stumble a bit more than normal 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.720
 then you have to observe how he walks 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.540
 to see if you may be having some 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.460
 physical difficulty sometimes you are 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.590
 difficulties are found in a 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.870
 variation in hip development 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.330
 and it is advised to visit a pediatrician or 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.570
 podiatrist they will be able to offer 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.150
 the right advice the shoes of 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.490
 leather adapt to the shape of the foot by 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.590
 what should never be changed between children 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.770
 since the form can be totally 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.979
 inadequate and can even cause damage 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.650
 these are some simple tips 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.629
 tips for babies' feet 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.909
 replace the shoes for one more size 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:13.270
 large as soon as necessary 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:17.240
 teach children to put their heels 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.520
 remains when walking if they do this wrong 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.190
 It will affect the whole body and its 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.340
 balance bathes the feet at least 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.009
 twice or three a week with water 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.550
 warm cuts the toenails in 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:34.340
 straight shape not round the corners the 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.800
 Calluses and calluses require attention 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.319
 professional since they can be symptoms 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.539
 of a more serious foot disease 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:44.750
 Ingrown nails are usually 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:48.229
 caused by an incorrect cut but 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.889
 There may be incidental congenital injury 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.719
 shoes and socks that do not fit well 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.479
 fungi and orthopedic problems that are 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.629
 Contributing factors keep the 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.330
 shoes for children in good condition 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:03.590
 Provides a healthy and balanced diet 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.229
 teaches children to practice 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.360
 daily hygiene to protect against 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.060
 athlete's foot 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.310
 once the infection is contracted, 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.759
 try the treatment without the advice 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.129
 professional seeks professional help what 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:20.050
 as soon as possible if the child has knees 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:23.020
 joints or legs or feet 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.439
 arched these defects can be the 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.729
 result of other foot problems 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.949
 many of these conditions can 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:33.819
 correct yourself easily if you take good care of yourself 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.889
 In the early stages, make the feet 

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.400
 of children be examined at 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:41.080
 regular intervals by a podiatrist 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.569
 remember that foot health starts 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.479
 in childhood and that the feet of a child 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:48.400
 They must serve for life his life 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.379

 develop strong feet and 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:55.139
 healthy as they grow until the 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.139
 maturity
