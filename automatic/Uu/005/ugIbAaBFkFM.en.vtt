these<00:04:07.370> little<00:04:07.670> pieces<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.300> get<00:04:08.390> over<00:04:08.570> there

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
these little pieces to get over there

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.950 
these little pieces to get over there
and<00:04:08.990> get<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.230> crystal<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.890> then<00:04:10.520> run<00:04:10.960> before

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
and get the crystal and then run before

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.840 
and get the crystal and then run before
the<00:04:12.080> floor<00:04:12.320> comes<00:04:12.620> out<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.430> way<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.610> do

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
the floor comes out and the way you do

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.699 
the floor comes out and the way you do
that<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.910> pull<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.330> floor<00:04:17.540> out<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.620> it

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
that is you pull the floor out and it

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.560 
that is you pull the floor out and it
falls<00:04:18.920> out<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.549> didn't<00:04:19.820> make<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.299> time

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
falls out you didn't make it that time

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.890 
falls out you didn't make it that time
so<00:04:21.260> basically<00:04:21.650> it's<00:04:21.950> just<00:04:22.220> these<00:04:22.480> 2<00:04:23.480> by<00:04:23.630> 4

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
so basically it's just these 2 by 4

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.410 
so basically it's just these 2 by 4
tiles<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.980> then<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.400> slide<00:04:25.640> this<00:04:25.880> piece<00:04:26.180> back

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
tiles and then you slide this piece back

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.080 
tiles and then you slide this piece back
in<00:04:27.790> through<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.880> grooves

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
in through the grooves

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.580 
in through the grooves
so<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:34.010> tiles<00:04:35.010> back<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.610> I<00:04:36.380> guess<00:04:37.380> with

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
so and then tiles back so I guess with

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.190 
so and then tiles back so I guess with
the<00:04:37.620> studios<00:04:38.370> camera<00:04:39.120> if<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.450> have<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.810> set

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the studios camera if you have that set

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.550 
the studios camera if you have that set
view<00:04:40.500> or<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.950> somehow<00:04:42.020> position<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.139> where<00:04:43.380> it

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
view or to somehow position it where it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.210 
view or to somehow position it where it
doesn't<00:04:43.889> see<00:04:44.040> your<00:04:44.220> fingers<00:04:44.990> moving<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.220> this
