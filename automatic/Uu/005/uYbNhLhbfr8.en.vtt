00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.230 

let<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.270> introduce<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:30.409> here<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.829> part

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
let me introduce you here on this part

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
let me introduce you here on this part
we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.570> installed<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> 3d<00:01:34.770> depth<00:01:35.009> slider<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we have installed the 3d depth slider to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.950 
we have installed the 3d depth slider to
adjust<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.840> 3d<00:01:37.290> effect<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.240> maximize<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
adjust the 3d effect you can maximize it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.710 
adjust the 3d effect you can maximize it
or<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.070> remove<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> speedy<00:01:41.939> altogether

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
or you can remove the speedy altogether

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.780 
or you can remove the speedy altogether
or<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.369> choose<00:01:44.399> any<00:01:45.210> degree<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.960> between

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
or you can choose any degree in between

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
or you can choose any degree in between
simply<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:48.000> moving<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.110> slider<00:01:50.990> we<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.350> also

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
simply by moving the slider we have also

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.219 
simply by moving the slider we have also
given<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.399> lot<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> thought<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.899> screen

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
given a lot of thought to the screen

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.700 
given a lot of thought to the screen
itself<00:01:56.090> because<00:01:57.090> Nintendo<00:01:57.750> 3ds<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
itself because Nintendo 3ds is the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
itself because Nintendo 3ds is the
successor<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> nintendo<00:02:00.060> DS<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:02.070> actually<00:02:02.450> eat

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
successor to nintendo DS it actually eat

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.119 
successor to nintendo DS it actually eat
naturally<00:02:04.229> comes<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.399> touch<00:02:05.729> panel<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:07.129> we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
naturally comes with a touch panel as we

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.220 
naturally comes with a touch panel as we
experimented<00:02:08.910> however<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:11.340> realized<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
experimented however we realized that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.950 
experimented however we realized that
finger<00:02:13.230> marks

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
finger marks

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.000 
finger marks
and<00:02:14.050> other<00:02:14.560> smart<00:02:14.980> genes<00:02:15.900> reduced<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.560> 3d

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
and other smart genes reduced the 3d

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.390 
and other smart genes reduced the 3d
impact<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.080> did<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.950> decrease

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
impact and so did the decrease

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.950 
impact and so did the decrease
transparency<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> touch<00:02:23.350> screen<00:02:23.560> itself

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
transparency of the touch screen itself

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.580 
transparency of the touch screen itself
in<00:02:25.960> other<00:02:26.380> words<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:27.360> touchscreen<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.750> 3d

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
in other words a touchscreen and 3d

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.560 
in other words a touchscreen and 3d
screen<00:02:29.890> do<00:02:30.880> not<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.420> along<00:02:31.600> very<00:02:31.780> well

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
screen do not get along very well

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.800 
screen do not get along very well
because<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.980> decided<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.940> employ<00:02:37.390> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
because of this we decided to employ a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.310 
because of this we decided to employ a
touchscreen<00:02:38.610> only<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.150> bottom<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:41.080> we

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
touchscreen only on the bottom just we

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.300 
touchscreen only on the bottom just we
did<00:02:41.560> for<00:02:42.310> nintendo<00:02:42.790> DS<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.990> what<00:02:46.990> makes<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
did for nintendo DS and what makes the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.840 
did for nintendo DS and what makes the
images<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.090> impactful<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.170> not<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.520> 3d

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
images so impactful is not just a 3d

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.630 
images so impactful is not just a 3d
image<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.650> nature<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> graphics<00:02:56.640> it

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
image but the nature of the graphics it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.750 
image but the nature of the graphics it
been<00:02:58.000> six<00:02:58.750> years<00:02:59.020> since<00:02:59.440> we<00:03:00.340> launched

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
been six years since we launched

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.510 
been six years since we launched
Nintendo<00:03:01.300> DS<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.650> while<00:03:03.340> we've<00:03:04.180> now<00:03:04.450> added<00:03:04.660> 3d

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
Nintendo DS so while we've now added 3d

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.730 
Nintendo DS so while we've now added 3d
we've<00:03:06.520> also<00:03:06.910> made<00:03:07.570> improvement<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.710> the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
we've also made improvement to the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.760 
we've also made improvement to the
graphics<00:03:09.460> capability<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:11.260> hardware

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
graphics capability of this hardware

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.520 
graphics capability of this hardware
itself<00:03:13.560> something<00:03:14.560> tells<00:03:14.830> me<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.910> alone

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
itself something tells me this alone

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.550 
itself something tells me this alone
might<00:03:17.530> cause<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> lot<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.430> enthusiasm<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
might cause a lot of enthusiasm in the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.100 
might cause a lot of enthusiasm in the
development<00:03:21.070> community<00:03:24.060> next<00:03:25.110> let's

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
development community next let's

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.740 
development community next let's
consider<00:03:26.470> control<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:30.490> installed<00:03:31.090> what<00:03:31.450> we

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
consider control we installed what we

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.070 
consider control we installed what we
call<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.230> slide<00:03:32.590> back<00:03:33.240> design<00:03:34.240> for<00:03:34.690> another

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
call the slide back design for another

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.690 
call the slide back design for another
England<00:03:36.300> we've<00:03:37.300> also<00:03:37.680> integrated<00:03:38.680> both<00:03:39.370> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
England we've also integrated both a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.220 
England we've also integrated both a
motion<00:03:40.510> sensor<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.340> gyro<00:03:42.340> sensor<00:03:43.230> I'm

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
motion sensor and the gyro sensor I'm

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.830 
motion sensor and the gyro sensor I'm
really<00:03:44.650> hopeful<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.490> just<00:03:46.300> as<00:03:46.480> with

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
really hopeful that just as with
