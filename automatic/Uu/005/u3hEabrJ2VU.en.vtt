so
what<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.799> think<00:01:08.860> about<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.400> and<00:01:09.790> now<00:01:10.180> first

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
what do I think about it and now first

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.790 
what do I think about it and now first
thing<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.409> keep<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.650> mind

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.630 

I<00:01:13.860> don't<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.910> have<00:01:15.060> much

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
I don't really have much

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.429 
I don't really have much
to<00:01:17.330> compare<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.810> accept

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
to compare it to accept

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
to compare it to accept
the<00:01:21.340> ninja<00:01:21.579> 250<00:01:22.090> which<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.479> used<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.810> have

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the ninja 250 which I used to have

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
the ninja 250 which I used to have
so<00:01:25.430> compare<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> ninja<00:01:26.880> 250<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:28.670> lot<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.760> big

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so compare the ninja 250 a lot of big

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.770 
so compare the ninja 250 a lot of big
differences

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
differences

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.390 
differences

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
first the power no I have a lot of

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.760 
first the power no I have a lot of
people<00:01:36.550> requesting<00:01:36.970> okay<00:01:37.480> should<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.050> start<00:01:38.560> on

people requesting okay should I start on

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.330 
people requesting okay should I start on
a<00:01:38.800> 250<00:01:39.520> or<00:01:40.120> should<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.510> started<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:40.930> 600<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:42.130> saw<00:01:42.310> a

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
a 250 or should I started a 600 I saw a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.480 
a 250 or should I started a 600 I saw a
thousand<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.270> saw<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.479> 650<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:47.530> driving

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
thousand I saw a 650 and from driving

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.560 
thousand I saw a 650 and from driving
for<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> while<00:01:49.030> now

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
for a while now

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.430 
for a while now
I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:51.490> if<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.720> were<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:54.070> know<00:01:54.100> under<00:01:55.050> 6<00:01:56.050> 1

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
I think if you were you know under 6 1

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
I think if you were you know under 6 1
and<00:01:57.720> under<00:01:58.860> like<00:02:01.080> 200<00:02:02.080> pounds<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
and under like 200 pounds and you

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.889 
and under like 200 pounds and you
haven't<00:02:03.700> ridden<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> bike<00:02:04.060> before<00:02:04.210> I'd<00:02:04.600> say

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
haven't ridden the bike before I'd say

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.840 
haven't ridden the bike before I'd say
you<00:02:04.960> go<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.380> 250<00:02:05.649> because<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.190> still<00:02:06.490> I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
you go for the 250 because I still I

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.359 
you go for the 250 because I still I
look<00:02:07.360> back<00:02:07.540> at<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.530> know<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.830> I'll<00:02:09.130> had<00:02:09.340> a

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
look back at it you know and I'll had a

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.280 
look back at it you know and I'll had a
blast<00:02:09.820> on<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.179> bike<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.390> know<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.840> great

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
blast on that bike you know it's great

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.110 
blast on that bike you know it's great
to<00:02:11.440> learn<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:14.200> being<00:02:14.350> said<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
to learn on but that being said the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.420 
to learn on but that being said the
reason<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.540> upgraded<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.680> most<00:02:18.190> people

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
reason I upgraded and most people

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.830 
reason I upgraded and most people
upgrade<00:02:18.900> quickly<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.110> because<00:02:21.239> your<00:02:22.239> power<00:02:22.480> is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
upgrade quickly is because your power is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250 
upgrade quickly is because your power is
limited<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.910> remember<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.970> did<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.930> trip

perfect<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.620> round<00:02:48.100> town<00:02:48.340> commuting<00:02:48.850> I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
perfect for a round town commuting I

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.910 
perfect for a round town commuting I
mean<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.870> really<00:02:50.170> don't<00:02:50.350> think<00:02:50.470> there<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.769> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
mean I really don't think there is a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.280 
mean I really don't think there is a
better<00:02:51.250> bike<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.700> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
better bike for that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.759 
better bike for that
but<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.760> know<00:02:54.909> once<00:02:55.720> again<00:02:55.840> if<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.470> plan<00:02:56.739> on

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
but you know once again if you plan on

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.059 
but you know once again if you plan on
doing<00:02:56.950> any<00:02:57.640> highway<00:02:58.120> travel<00:02:58.599> like<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> fairly

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
doing any highway travel like a fairly

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.860 
doing any highway travel like a fairly
long<00:03:00.220> distance<00:03:00.900> half<00:03:01.900> an<00:03:02.019> hour<00:03:02.170> or<00:03:02.439> so<00:03:02.650> or

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
long distance half an hour or so or

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.160 
long distance half an hour or so or
basically<00:03:04.870> travel<00:03:05.290> at<00:03:05.379> all<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.900> say

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
basically travel at all I would say

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.930 
basically travel at all I would say
start<00:03:08.970> or<00:03:09.970> neither<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.930> 650<00:03:11.680> our<00:03:11.829> Kawasaki<00:03:12.730> or

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
start or neither the 650 our Kawasaki or

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.259 
start or neither the 650 our Kawasaki or
this<00:03:13.329> FZ<00:03:13.690> 6r<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> as<00:03:15.879> I've<00:03:16.120> mentioned

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
this FZ 6r and as I've mentioned

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.869 
this FZ 6r and as I've mentioned
previously<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:17.140> reason<00:03:17.379> I<00:03:17.440> chose<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.220> Yamaha

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
previously the reason I chose the Yamaha

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.339 
previously the reason I chose the Yamaha
over<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.420> Kawasaki<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:21.720> basis<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:23.230> know

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
over the Kawasaki is basis you know

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.929 
over the Kawasaki is basis you know
their<00:03:23.530> stats<00:03:23.859> were<00:03:24.069> basically<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.519> same<00:03:24.640> as

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
their stats were basically the same as

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.380 
their stats were basically the same as
far<00:03:25.090> as<00:03:25.209> performance<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:26.849> just<00:03:27.849> kind<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.090> like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
far as performance I just kind of like

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.289 
far as performance I just kind of like
the<00:03:28.540> way<00:03:28.659> the<00:03:29.079> fz6<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:30.099> looked<00:03:30.400> personally

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
the way the fz6 are looked personally

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.930 
the way the fz6 are looked personally
remember<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.930> was<00:03:32.079> just<00:03:32.230> me<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:33.430> either<00:03:33.639> one<00:03:33.909> I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
remember I was just me but either one I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.539 
remember I was just me but either one I
think<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.420> great<00:03:34.629> bike<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.310> after<00:03:36.310> driving

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
think is a great bike and after driving

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.729 
think is a great bike and after driving
this<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:36.909> a<00:03:36.940> while<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.359> don't<00:03:37.900> really<00:03:38.079> know<00:03:38.379> why

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
this for a while I don't really know why

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.520 
this for a while I don't really know why
I<00:03:38.769> would<00:03:39.129> upgrade<00:03:39.609> at<00:03:40.209> least<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.659> for<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.900> while

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
I would upgrade at least not for a while

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.220 
I would upgrade at least not for a while
I<00:03:42.690> mean<00:03:44.010> unless<00:03:45.010> you're<00:03:45.370> like<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.959> plan<00:03:47.200> on

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
I mean unless you're like you plan on

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.500 
I mean unless you're like you plan on
going<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.950> know<00:03:48.099> drag<00:03:48.519> racing<00:03:49.060> or<00:03:49.150> something

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
going you know drag racing or something

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.890 
going you know drag racing or something
there's<00:03:50.200> really<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.709> don't<00:03:50.950> really<00:03:51.599> know<00:03:52.599> why

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
there's really I don't really know why

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.360 
there's really I don't really know why
would<00:03:53.230> need<00:03:53.379> upgrade

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
would need upgrade

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.580 
would need upgrade
if<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.090> wanted<00:03:56.480> toured<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.959> country<00:03:57.349> I<00:03:57.379> could

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
if I wanted toured the country I could

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.120 
if I wanted toured the country I could
do<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:57.980> spike

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
do it on the spike

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.950 
do it on the spike
but<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.060> know<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.480> would<00:04:01.690> make<00:04:01.840> little

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
but you know I would make little

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.840 
but you know I would make little
modifications<00:04:02.770> to<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.040> seat<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.550> forth

modifications to the seat and so forth
but<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.570> know<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:05.230> bike<00:04:05.590> has<00:04:05.740> been<00:04:05.890> able<00:04:05.980> to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
but you know this bike has been able to

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.850 
but you know this bike has been able to
handle<00:04:06.460> just<00:04:06.910> fine<00:04:07.240> I<00:04:07.270> mean<00:04:07.600> I've<00:04:08.530> really

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
handle just fine I mean I've really

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.430 
handle just fine I mean I've really
loved<00:04:09.160> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.690 

you<00:04:13.950> know<00:04:14.070> it's<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.810> not<00:04:16.019> too<00:04:16.590> big<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.459> it's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you know it's it's not too big so it's

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.930 
you know it's it's not too big so it's
still<00:04:17.970> light<00:04:18.180> maneuverable<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:18.989> course<00:04:19.230> is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
still light maneuverable of course is

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.420 
still light maneuverable of course is
quite<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> bit<00:04:21.150> larger<00:04:21.269> than<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.720> 250<00:04:22.430> they

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
quite a bit larger than the 250 they

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.150 
quite a bit larger than the 250 they
call<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> socket<00:04:23.850> 250<00:04:24.420> but<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.710> has<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.130> know

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
call a socket 250 but it has you know

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.720 
call a socket 250 but it has you know
plenty<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.880> power<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.240> get<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.660> go<00:04:27.750> I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
plenty of power to get up and go I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.640 
plenty of power to get up and go I
haven't<00:04:29.730> ever<00:04:30.030> actually<00:04:30.300> seen<00:04:30.720> anyone<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.530> a

wheelie<00:04:31.950> on<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:34.130> z6r<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.670> guess<00:04:36.090> it's

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
wheelie on the z6r but I guess it's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.910 
wheelie on the z6r but I guess it's
possible<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.780> do<00:04:37.770> willing<00:04:38.100> anything<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.550> guess

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
possible I do willing anything I guess

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.720 
possible I do willing anything I guess
