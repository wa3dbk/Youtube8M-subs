tutorial this is how to make a golf ball
what<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.830> go<00:00:08.460> here<00:00:09.090> and

what you want to do is go here and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.190 
what you want to do is go here and
geometry<00:00:10.110> standard<00:00:10.980> primitives<00:00:11.130> GS<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:12.240> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
geometry standard primitives GS here you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.129 
geometry standard primitives GS here you
want<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> make<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> decent<00:00:13.950> size<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.630> then

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
want to make a decent size here and then

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.910 
want to make a decent size here and then
you<00:00:16.560> want<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.160> make<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.880> an<00:00:18.090> editable<00:00:18.449> poly

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
you want to make that an editable poly

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.200 
you want to make that an editable poly
then<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.070> want<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> mess<00:00:20.520> move<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:24.060> make<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
then you want to mess move it to make it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.290 
then you want to mess move it to make it
look<00:00:24.359> smoother<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> looks<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.300> then

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
look smoother so it looks like that then

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.080 
look smoother so it looks like that then
you<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> collapse<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.820> then<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> want<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you want to collapse to then you want to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.530 
you want to collapse to then you want to
click<00:00:30.150> hold<00:00:30.449> yes<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.070> go<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.579> now

now you want to select all the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.210 
now you want to select all the
Pentagon's<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.570> are<00:01:51.869> 51<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.800> two

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
Pentagon's that are 51 that is one two

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.270 
Pentagon's that are 51 that is one two
three<00:01:54.520> four<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.869> have<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.350> do<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.680> way<00:01:56.890> so

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and just select every pen Tom Pentagon

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.559 
and just select every pen Tom Pentagon
that's<00:02:38.200> less<00:02:39.200> than<00:02:39.230> 5<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.360> have

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569

finished yeah there's no more then you
want<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.130> drag<00:02:52.489> down<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.209> want<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.510> bevel

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
want to drag down and you want to bevel

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.100 
want to drag down and you want to bevel
it<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.640> pebble<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.209> about<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.140> much<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
it so pebble it in about that much and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.370 
it so pebble it in about that much and
extreme<00:03:00.110> then<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.780> now<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.230> look

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
extreme then do that and now if you look

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.020 
extreme then do that and now if you look
at<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:03.769> doesn't<00:03:04.340> look<00:03:04.489> very<00:03:04.640> neat

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
at it like that doesn't look very neat

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.270 
at it like that doesn't look very neat
does<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.350> now<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.500> want<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.769> measure<00:03:06.920> move

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
does it so now you want to measure move

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.670 
does it so now you want to measure move
it<00:03:08.590> nice<00:03:09.590> move<00:03:10.010> nice<00:03:10.730> move<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.810> then<00:03:15.200> make<00:03:15.410> it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
it nice move nice move and then make it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.720 
it nice move nice move and then make it
