situations and so I talked to them early

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.799 
situations and so I talked to them early
on<00:00:35.700> when<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> conceptual<00:00:37.140> stage<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.809> got

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
on when in the conceptual stage and got

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
on when in the conceptual stage and got
involved<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.350> them<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:41.309> far<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.910> know

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and making sure that he moved the same

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
and making sure that he moved the same
he<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.260> react<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> same<00:00:55.949> his<00:00:56.250> thought

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
he would react the same his thought
process<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> same<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.960> letting

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
process would be the same and letting

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
process would be the same and letting
the<00:00:58.739> player<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.340> involved<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> itself

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the player get involved in that itself

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.670 
the player get involved in that itself
and<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> thing<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> beginning<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.840> -<00:01:04.110> we

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and the thing at the beginning was - we

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
and the thing at the beginning was - we
talked<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:06.119> wanted<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.570> make

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
talked about it and they wanted to make

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
talked about it and they wanted to make
try<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.650> every<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> played<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
try and have every time you played as a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.130 
try and have every time you played as a
player<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> different<00:01:11.040> result<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
player to have a different result or not

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
player to have a different result or not
try<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.830> technique<00:01:14.310> done

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
try not to have the same technique done

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
try not to have the same technique done
exactly<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> same<00:01:15.180> way<00:01:15.330> every<00:01:15.720> time<00:01:15.750> which

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
exactly the same way every time which

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.899 
exactly the same way every time which
was<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> huge<00:01:17.570> undertaking<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.009> big

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
was a huge undertaking and I think a big

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.690 
was a huge undertaking and I think a big
leap<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> end<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.439> evolution<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
leap and in the end the evolution of the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.530 
leap and in the end the evolution of the
gaming<00:01:27.150> itself<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> yeah<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.420> know

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
gaming itself so that yeah but you know

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.499 
gaming itself so that yeah but you know
the<00:01:30.810> interesting<00:01:31.170> part<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.880> challenging

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the interesting part and the challenging

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.069 
the interesting part and the challenging
part<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.970> provide<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.270> knowledge<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
part was to provide that knowledge of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.300 
part was to provide that knowledge of
having<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> library<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> moves<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.320> having<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
having a library of moves and having it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.060 
having a library of moves and having it
all<00:01:41.520> fit<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> game<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.259> because

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
all fit into the game you know because

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
all fit into the game you know because
there's<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.880> many<00:01:45.000> combinations<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.930> moves

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
there's so many combinations of moves

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.120 
there's so many combinations of moves
that<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.430> provide<00:01:48.030> every<00:01:48.420> possibility<00:01:49.130> for

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
that to provide every possibility for

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
that to provide every possibility for
under<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.840> every<00:01:52.320> possible

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
under and and in every possible

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.380 
under and and in every possible
combination<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:54.409> ways<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.619> doing<00:01:55.740> stuff<00:01:56.390> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
combination of ways of doing stuff to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.109 
combination of ways of doing stuff to
have<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.140> option<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.369> few<00:01:59.610> buttons<00:01:59.820> on

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
have that the option of a few buttons on

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
have that the option of a few buttons on
it<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> game<00:02:01.079> controller<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.040> pretty

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it on a game controller was is pretty

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.690 
it on a game controller was is pretty
challenging<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.090> itself<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> way<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
challenging in itself so it was a way to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.540 
challenging in itself so it was a way to
for<00:02:05.700> myself<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.570> way<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> finding<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> way

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
for myself it was a way to finding a way

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.839 
for myself it was a way to finding a way
to<00:02:08.720> provide<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.800> much<00:02:11.099> choices<00:02:11.520> as

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
to provide that as much choices as

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.860 
to provide that as much choices as
possible<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
possible but

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.009 
possible but
with<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.580> controlled<00:02:16.849> group

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
with it was in a controlled group

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.570 
with it was in a controlled group
grouping<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.170> techniques<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.099> be<00:02:20.340> able<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
grouping of techniques to be able to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660 
grouping of techniques to be able to
make<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.060> available<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.019> player<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:23.099> we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
make it available to the player so we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.640 
make it available to the player so we
talked<00:02:24.269> about<00:02:24.530> basically<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:26.540> looked<00:02:27.540> at<00:02:27.720> marsh

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
talked about basically I looked at marsh

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280 
talked about basically I looked at marsh
fighting<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:30.000> martial<00:02:30.360> arts<00:02:30.569> system<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:31.170> if

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
fighting or martial arts system or if

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.899 
fighting or martial arts system or if
like<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.829> say<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.430> providing<00:02:32.849> a

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
like you would say like providing a

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.030 
like you would say like providing a
Grey's<00:02:33.120> Anatomy<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.900> martial<00:02:34.860> arts

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
Grey's Anatomy of martial arts

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.080 
Grey's Anatomy of martial arts
techniques<00:02:35.659> as<00:02:36.659> like<00:02:37.409> a<00:02:37.440> PI<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.760> know<00:02:38.879> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
techniques as like a PI you know and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.789 
techniques as like a PI you know and
basically<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.599> start<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:40.049> here<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.560> base

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
basically you start from here at a base

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.009 
basically you start from here at a base
in<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.099> center<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.209> have<00:02:42.239> single

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
in the center and you have single

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.500 
in the center and you have single
techniques<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.190> maybe<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.489> jab<00:02:44.849> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
techniques you know like maybe a jab and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
techniques you know like maybe a jab and
you<00:02:45.870> know<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:45.989> double<00:02:46.379> jab<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> jab<00:02:47.040> cross<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
you know a double jab a jab cross and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.539 
you know a double jab a jab cross and
then<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.420> building<00:02:49.349> combinations<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.370> moves

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
then in building combinations and moves

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.309 
then in building combinations and moves
from<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.209> each<00:02:51.329> time<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
from there and each time you do that it

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.319 
from there and each time you do that it
will<00:02:52.349> build<00:02:52.590> exponentially<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> larger<00:02:54.299> and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
will build exponentially to a larger and

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.110 
will build exponentially to a larger and
larger<00:02:54.540> larger<00:02:55.140> circle<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.790> all<00:02:56.790> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
larger larger circle and all that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.000 
larger larger circle and all that
information<00:02:57.299> would<00:02:58.079> nest<00:02:58.409> not<00:02:58.620> necessarily

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
information would nest not necessarily

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.780 
information would nest not necessarily
fit<00:02:59.340> into<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:01.079> know<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.379> game<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.370> also

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
fit into you know a game so and also

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.149 
fit into you know a game so and also
some<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.359> we<00:03:03.540> may<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.319> necessary<00:03:04.859> also

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
some of it we may not be necessary also

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.619 
some of it we may not be necessary also
because<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:05.879> know<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.030> may<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.269> more

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
because you know you may have more

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.569 
because you know you may have more
flashy<00:03:07.049> moves<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.859> things<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.400> which

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
flashy moves and things like that which

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.229 
flashy moves and things like that which
are<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.879> Lauren's<00:03:09.450> character<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.310> it's

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
are not Lauren's character and and it's

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.059 
are not Lauren's character and and it's
just<00:03:12.390> eliminating<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.470> possibilities

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
just eliminating that as possibilities

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.550 
just eliminating that as possibilities
but<00:03:14.549> still<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.329> PI<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.599> still<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
but still the PI is still you know I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.949 
but still the PI is still you know I
mean<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.099> shape<00:03:17.849> of<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> PI<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.329> still<00:03:18.660> pretty

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
mean the shape of the PI is still pretty

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.979 
mean the shape of the PI is still pretty
big<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:20.220> start<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.910> pick<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.569> slice

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
big so we we start with I pick a slice

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
big so we we start with I pick a slice
basically<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> slice<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.639> pie<00:03:23.849> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
basically like a slice of the pie and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.909 
basically like a slice of the pie and
you'd<00:03:24.299> have<00:03:24.510> something<00:03:25.169> here<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:25.769> it

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
you'd have something here and then it

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.740 
you'd have something here and then it
would<00:03:26.010> grow<00:03:26.280> exponentially<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.569> way

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
would grow exponentially out this way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.199 
would grow exponentially out this way
rather<00:03:27.959> than<00:03:28.230> from<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:28.919> out<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> big<00:03:29.730> full

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
rather than from here out to a big full

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.539 
rather than from here out to a big full
circle<00:03:30.690> which<00:03:30.870> would<00:03:31.109> be<00:03:31.319> endless<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.430> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
circle which would be endless so that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.819 
circle which would be endless so that
was<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.910> challenge<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.629> felt<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.349> for<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
was the challenge I felt it was for the

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.159 
was the challenge I felt it was for the
programmers<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.000> developers<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.989> that

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
programmers and the developers is that

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.400 
programmers and the developers is that
okay<00:03:38.180> they're<00:03:39.180> concerned<00:03:39.599> whether<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:39.989> not<00:03:40.079> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
okay they're concerned whether or not I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.229 
okay they're concerned whether or not I
would<00:03:40.980> be<00:03:41.129> able<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.459> provide<00:03:41.819> enough

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
would be able to provide enough

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.539 
would be able to provide enough
information<00:03:42.660> my<00:03:43.169> concern<00:03:43.560> was<00:03:43.739> there's<00:03:44.250> not<00:03:44.519> a

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
information my concern was there's not a

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.979 
information my concern was there's not a
problem<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.120> providing<00:03:45.540> enough<00:03:45.720> information

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
problem of providing enough information

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.020 
problem of providing enough information
but<00:03:46.349> how<00:03:46.949> are<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.129> gonna<00:03:47.280> fit<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.699> into<00:03:47.849> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
but how are you gonna fit it into the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.300 
but how are you gonna fit it into the
game<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.840> let<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.440> be<00:03:49.560> available<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
game and and let it be available to the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.579 
game and and let it be available to the
players
