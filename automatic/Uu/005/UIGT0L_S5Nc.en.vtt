00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
little bit so it's kind of tough to use

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.990 
little bit so it's kind of tough to use
it's<00:02:13.280> also<00:02:13.459> somewhat<00:02:14.030> difficult<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:16.000> cut

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's also somewhat difficult to cut

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.410 
it's also somewhat difficult to cut
tubes<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.920> center<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.700> camera<00:02:20.269> view

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
tubes in the center of the camera view

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.380 
tubes in the center of the camera view
kind<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.599> sucks<00:02:23.900> actually

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
recommend using a tube cutter use a

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.780 
recommend using a tube cutter use a
hacksaw<00:02:33.380> yeah<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> lot<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.549> times<00:02:34.700> you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
hacksaw yeah a lot of the times you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.920 
hacksaw yeah a lot of the times you
gotta<00:02:34.940> cut<00:02:35.120> an<00:02:35.209> angle

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
gotta cut an angle

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.569 
gotta cut an angle
and<00:02:36.709> you're<00:02:36.829> gonna<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.130> lot<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> burrs

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
and you're gonna get a lot of burrs

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.819 
and you're gonna get a lot of burrs
which<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:38.750> want<00:02:38.840> any<00:02:39.110> burrs<00:02:39.349> on<00:02:39.650> there

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
which we don't want any burrs on there

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.240 
which we don't want any burrs on there
because<00:02:40.130> we're<00:02:40.280> gonna<00:02:40.400> have<00:02:41.769> braided<00:02:42.769> cable

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
because we're gonna have braided cable

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.660 
because we're gonna have braided cable
running<00:02:43.610> through<00:02:43.880> these<00:02:44.030> tubes<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.519> just

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
running through these tubes and we just

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.990 
running through these tubes and we just
don't<00:02:46.730> want<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.030> get<00:02:47.230> hung<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.590> anything

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't want it to get hung up on anything

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.160 
don't want it to get hung up on anything
it's<00:02:50.000> kind<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:51.260> could<00:02:51.410> cause<00:02:51.620> problems<00:02:53.170> so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's kind of it could cause problems so
