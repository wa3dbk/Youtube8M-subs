00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.510
 well that's it everyone it's true 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.100
 chic if you find yourself for a new 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.290
 video about dofus 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.450
 so it's going to be mostly again 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.970
 it must be at least there the fourth 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.040
 that I'm doing a video information so 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.920
 I got my ball that puts the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.289
 mavs been robbed a lava where I had wanted 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.990
 the sell and final of sir does 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.910
 take it as a blue so that the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.460
 account was subsequently certified there 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 will be good on the account I did not care 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.279
 a little 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.710
 which made it a long time before 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.780
 to try to get it back but we are 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.039
 very happy about theirs 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.389
 assets and so for that at the same time 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.639
 maybe I'm a little motivated 

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:45.039
 maybe to make videos on 

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:47.829
 dofus on which I do not know how 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.409
 we will not have them either 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.429
 tried to give me ideas 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.819
 after that it's clear that the videos from 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.399
 like rostov besides I do not know if that 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.199
 would interest me a lot because 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.120
 christophe asobal to get up is very 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.710
 long very boring I will see if not 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.650
 after why there are no more others 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 videos for a month two months I know 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.920
 not exactly to say a big 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.340
 big demotivation he did not come 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.350
 necessarily that games besides how 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 words of a big motivation especially 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.970
 that they could have in my life is 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.370
 also maybe that success that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.130
 I could have waited said not synonymous 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.750
 that I was expecting millions of views etc 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 but hey there I'm barely 200 views 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.410
 on the videos I think of 1 of the stars 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.790
 wars while at the good we still 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.050
 1300 subscribers go like a fly says I 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.760
 am mostly subscribers who did not come 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.780
 for two streams et cetera but hey I'm 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.690
 am told maybe they could 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.730
 to be interested in overseas I do not know 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.840
 finally after we'll see 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.490
 that's why I do not know maybe 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 come back a little on future ones of 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.940
 kolizeum fights at home I have my 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 ecac still a little stuff but that is 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.070
 ridiculous I really do not know what I 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.870
 I'm going to see anyway 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.170
 the pace of the videos will not be like 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.539
 it had been at its peak what for the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.230
 chain even though I just passed 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.790
 partners youtube briefcase 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.580
 it also motivates me a bit because it 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.750
 was a long time that I coveted 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 to be a partner we just had to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.950
 monetization before but not the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.510
 being a youtube partner so 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.440
 So if you really are the videos 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.659
 to inform you or other what his 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.909
 league 2 men to warriors the success 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.599
 or there again hollow bodies of 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.760
 novelties not it seems that the 2.9 is 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.530
 really well the only one I find 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.060
 find ridiculous me I may be 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.829
 to insult me is really the fact 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.370
 to be able to change the face of his 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.280
 characters 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.340
 I find that it breaks everything was 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.920
 this at the level of the roleplay not the gameplay 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.599
 but I roleplay lÃ© not all 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 characters in the same figure I like 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.579
 I did not really like that 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.109
 besides you can see us show 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.049
 quickly done with the inventory me 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.349
 personally I kept my head 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:15.590
 from veal to balls I prefer like that 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.590
 I'm at his side 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.359
 not bad too so that's all face 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.010
 just to prevent a little bit 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.829
 give you news 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.829
 and I tell you at the next twingo
