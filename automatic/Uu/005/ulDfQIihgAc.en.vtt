overcast end of the day really what I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.330 
overcast end of the day really what I
should<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.790> done<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:24.380> should<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:24.980> shot

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
should have done is I should have shot

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.320 
should have done is I should have shot
one<00:02:25.880> same<00:02:26.390> with<00:02:27.080> both<00:02:27.320> cameras<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
one same with both cameras like this and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.110 
one same with both cameras like this and
then<00:02:29.630> done<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.410> comparison<00:02:31.190> test<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.090> that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
then done the comparison test so that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.690 
then done the comparison test so that
you<00:02:32.420> could<00:02:32.630> see<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:33.530> would<00:02:33.740> give<00:02:33.920> us<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.400> more

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
you could see that would give us a more

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.699 
you could see that would give us a more
true<00:02:35.709> representation<00:02:36.709> but<00:02:38.200> let<00:02:39.200> me<00:02:39.230> show<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
true representation but let me show you

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.030 
true representation but let me show you
in<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.550> sense<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.870> know<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.590> side

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
in this sense that you know on this side

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.340 
in this sense that you know on this side
you<00:02:43.430> know<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> colors<00:02:44.510> are<00:02:44.690> quite<00:02:44.930> sore<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
you know the colors are quite sore the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.590 
you know the colors are quite sore the
realistic<00:02:46.100> yes<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.300> little<00:02:47.480> bit

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
realistic yes it's a little bit

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.380 
realistic yes it's a little bit
overexposed<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.850> look<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.180> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
overexposed here but if you look it to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.870 
overexposed here but if you look it to
the<00:02:50.510> way<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.750> explains<00:02:51.350> properly<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
the way it explains properly and the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.699 
the way it explains properly and the
bushes<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.540> background<00:02:54.200> they're<00:02:54.440> quite

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
bushes in the background they're quite

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.390 
bushes in the background they're quite
sharp<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.750> skin<00:02:57.110> tone<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.970> credible

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
sharp and the skin tone is of a credible

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.729 
sharp and the skin tone is of a credible
representation<00:03:01.400> where<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.150> iphone<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.350> skin

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
representation where the iphone the skin

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.479 
representation where the iphone the skin
tone<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.040> very<00:03:04.640> sort<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:04.940> pinky<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
tone is very sort of pinky the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.360 
tone is very sort of pinky the
background<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.330> quite<00:03:08.560> smear<00:03:09.560> lee<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.190> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
background is quite smear lee and it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.060 
background is quite smear lee and it
really<00:03:10.640> isn't<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.209> good<00:03:11.570> or<00:03:11.810> play<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.350> bit<00:03:12.769> for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
really isn't as good or play a bit for

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.640 
really isn't as good or play a bit for
you<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.580> see<00:03:13.850> where<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> link<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.720> if

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you so you can see where a link and if

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.450 
you so you can see where a link and if
we<00:03:15.709> play<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.550> this<00:03:17.000> side<00:03:17.360> here

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
we play the this side here

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.620 
we play the this side here
it's<00:03:20.460> going<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> live<00:03:20.940> look<00:03:21.090> jerky

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
it's going to be a live look jerky

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
it's going to be a live look jerky
because<00:03:21.960> I'm<00:03:22.110> recording<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.980> screen<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:24.030> can

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
because I'm recording the screen you can

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150 
because I'm recording the screen you can
see<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> skin<00:03:24.780> tones<00:03:25.050> look<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.830> bit

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
see the skin tones look a little bit

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.450 
see the skin tones look a little bit
sort<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:28.760> little<00:03:29.760> bit<00:03:29.910> smeared<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.310> I

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
sort of a little bit smeared and if I

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.860 
sort of a little bit smeared and if I
play<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.730> side<00:03:33.360> what<00:03:34.850> if<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.030> play<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.300> side

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
play this side what if I play this side

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.740 
play this side what if I play this side
you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.710> that<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.520> lot<00:03:38.760> sharper<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you can see that it's a lot sharper a

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.880 
you can see that it's a lot sharper a
lot<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.590> realistic<00:03:41.210> so<00:03:42.210> let's<00:03:43.110> do<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> was

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
lot more realistic so let's do I was

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.830 
lot more realistic so let's do I was
just<00:03:44.190> done<00:03:44.400> their<00:03:44.640> bio<00:03:44.910> excellent<00:03:45.510> if<00:03:45.600> we<00:03:45.720> go

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
just done their bio excellent if we go

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.020 
just done their bio excellent if we go
full<00:03:46.200> screen<00:03:46.590> you'll<00:03:47.370> be<00:03:47.610> able<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.850> get<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
full screen you'll be able to get a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.090 
full screen you'll be able to get a
better<00:03:48.270> sense<00:03:48.960> of<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.350> I'm<00:03:49.470> talking<00:03:50.010> about

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
better sense of what I'm talking about

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.020 
better sense of what I'm talking about
right<00:03:51.620> as<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.740> can<00:03:52.920> see<00:03:53.190> everything<00:03:53.700> here<00:03:53.940> is

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
right as you can see everything here is

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.260 
right as you can see everything here is
quite<00:03:54.330> sharp<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:56.370> background<00:03:56.670> looks

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
quite sharp and the background looks

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.230 
quite sharp and the background looks
quite<00:03:57.660> kind<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.080> credible<00:03:58.700> I'm<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> little<00:03:59.820> bit

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
quite kind of credible I'm a little bit

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.210 
quite kind of credible I'm a little bit
whitened<00:04:00.990> because<00:04:01.320> I'm<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> little<00:04:01.740> bit<00:04:01.830> avox

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
whitened because I'm a little bit avox

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.300 
whitened because I'm a little bit avox
place<00:04:02.520> because<00:04:02.820> where<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.270> stood<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.310> but

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
place because where I'm stood and but

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.340 
place because where I'm stood and but
that<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.790> know<00:04:05.940> from<00:04:06.420> shooting<00:04:06.870> lots<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.230> these

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
that I know from shooting lots of these

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.230 
that I know from shooting lots of these
videos<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:08.130> that's<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.580> lot<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.730> problem

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
videos that that's a lot of problem

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.930 
videos that that's a lot of problem
that's<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:11.490> wasn't<00:04:12.000> what<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.020> was

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
that's you know that wasn't what I was

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.610 
that's you know that wasn't what I was
when<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:14.970> shot<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.570> we<00:04:15.870> weren't<00:04:16.109> looking<00:04:16.530> to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
when I shot this we weren't looking to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.960 
when I shot this we weren't looking to
do<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> comparison<00:04:17.400> test<00:04:18.170> on<00:04:19.170> this<00:04:19.650> side<00:04:20.040> as<00:04:20.760> you

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
do a comparison test on this side as you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.780 
do a comparison test on this side as you
can<00:04:21.150> see<00:04:21.510> now<00:04:22.350> we<00:04:22.410> go<00:04:22.800> full<00:04:23.100> screen<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.640> can

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
can see now we go full screen you can

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.630 
can see now we go full screen you can
see<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.390> skin<00:04:24.810> tone<00:04:25.230> looks<00:04:26.040> it's<00:04:26.280> almost<00:04:26.490> like
