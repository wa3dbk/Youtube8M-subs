00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 More video should actually be today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.919
 Welcome to a product 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.660
 technical problems I could do that 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.370
 but not finished though 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.380
 do not worry in the next two to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 three days is coming in any case 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 Now there is a top 5 to the first 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 Athris review The tricks are all 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.769
 Compatible with 17 and 64 bit devices 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.769
 and then have fun with you 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 Number one still calls itself before two 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 and change the standard ios font 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.309
 in any other that dries 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.469
 Throughout the system, whether you're on 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 the homescreen so the app names or 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.000
 you even in the settings 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.180
 news app so really systemwide 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.379
 Do you have this new script from that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.270
 I think that's really cool 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 we can then here in the width of 2 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.440
 app just select a font 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.270
 and that just has to be clicked on 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 device is then called and brings 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 this font is in the system in there 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 cydia has a huge offer of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 so you can get one 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 choose any there and you can 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.750
 her down over is also expanding 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 Exception could create eg in ibooks 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 Of course that be a hindrance if you 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.010
 because another font is used because 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.960
 maybe not quite as readable 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 then you just pick yours for ibooks 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 another for a free war 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 In any case, quite extensive and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.460
 very very cool wrote number 2 calls 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 fold and bring you one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.810
 quick access to any app from 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.490
 homescreen you just have to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 here from the first homescreen site 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.360
 to the right wipe then you see 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 here this bar and if you are the far 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.590
 Enough says that the bar here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 is green then opens an app that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.500
 you have previously set in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.600
 Settings the whole and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.320
 turn off or next to an app 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.729
 choose 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 I have it in this example with the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 settings but you can 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 also choose each other and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.869
 So you are really very much 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 quickly in his favorite app war 3 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 and let's summarize them 4 times 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.920
 both have something to do with the keyboard 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.290
 to have 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.450
 For one thing, we have black 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 keyboard and the whole activates the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.579
 dark keyboard we already from the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 7.1 beta 1 but know with neither 2 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.580
 was removed again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.500
 So you have the possibility here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.190
 the dark keyboard on all devices too 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 to install 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.810
 and I think that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.270
 a visually more appealing than 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.310
 the hell the other trick is called 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.410
 showcase and you surely is already 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.690
 once noticed that the keyboard always 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.150
 upper case shows whether small or 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 big writes usually stand there 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 always uppercase and with 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 showcase will change the whole thing 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.770
 if we write small then 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.580
 the keyboard also shows the small ones 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.170
 letters on 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 Last but not least, we still have it 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.370
 message cost him his tweak the you 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.210
 The news app allows color to 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.710
 shape 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.150
 you can for example change the color of 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.520
 chat bubbles change or even the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.650
 Font color we just go in 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.000
 We close the settings beforehand 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.290
 the news app because that is 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.270
 necessary for the changes then 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
 be taken over and then we go 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.990
 here on messages costs meiser now 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.510
 can we adjust this for everything 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.240
 example that the imessage babbels in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.910
 one should be orange and the bubbles 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.010
 the other person for example in one 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 yellow and then we go out again 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.390
 go back to the news app and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.230
 as you can see the whole thing became instant 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.820
 accepted 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.560
 I think that looks really pretty 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.480
 not necessarily here with these 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.460
 colors but you had some 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 possibilities to adjust the whole and 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.100
 I would say just download it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.050
 and try it out 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.450
 that would be the top 5 already 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.920
 tricks of this video have been one 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.080
 But I want you to be small 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.970
 still very briefly show and that the app 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.590
 I can not protect you 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.970
 That's why I have them completely 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.840
 not taken in the top-5 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.490
 but do it here now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.410
 retrospectively you have the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.540
 possibility an app with yours 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.459
 That means fingerprint protection 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.530
 You can only with a stored 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.660
 fingerprint in this app is rhine 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.550
 very handy for example for the photos or the 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.140
 news app so that not any 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.240
 buddy especially the cell phone have in this 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.070
 apps come in if they do not 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.050
 should now just be here 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.030
 Put your finger on then you would get in 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.820
 the attitudes but I am unfortunately 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 on the 7.1 beta and that works 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.050
 I did not want that as I said 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.900
 have mentioned this briefly here 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.250
 time costs 2 dollars 99 but is 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 really damn cool 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.880
 that was it again from 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.320
 this video if you liked it 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.090
 I would take a thumb after myself 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.709
 above or a comment 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.570
 as I said on Tuesday or on Wednesday 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.310
 then comes the next product preview 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.400
 in my opinion also a really 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.650
 very cool product 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.150
 So be curious and stay tuned 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.720
 Thanks for watching up to the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 next time 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.810
 ciao
