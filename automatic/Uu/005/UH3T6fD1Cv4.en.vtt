so I found a few months ago in article
on<00:00:54.059> naturally<00:00:54.690> curls<00:00:54.930> calm<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> said<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
on naturally curls calm and it said the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.650 
on naturally curls calm and it said the
loc<00:00:56.250> method<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.969> something<00:00:57.449> about

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
loc method like something about

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
loc method like something about
moisturizing<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.620> locking<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> moisture<00:00:59.100> so

moisturizing and locking in moisture so

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
moisturizing and locking in moisture so
I<00:01:00.329> found<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> interesting<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.949> only

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
I found it interesting because it only

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600 
I found it interesting because it only
consists<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> three<00:01:03.420> steps<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.610> simple

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
consists of three steps very simple

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
consists of three steps very simple
steps<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.479> don't<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.020> who<00:01:07.200> thought<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
steps that I don't know who thought of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
steps that I don't know who thought of
this<00:01:07.799> method<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.430> genius<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this method that it's genius because it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
this method that it's genius because it
does<00:01:09.540> work<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> stuff<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> called<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.310> loc

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
does work so the stuff is called the loc

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
does work so the stuff is called the loc

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
bottom because for like two years I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.039 
bottom because for like two years I
haven't<00:01:52.990> had<00:01:53.140> an<00:01:53.409> actual<00:01:54.189> real<00:01:54.850> all-over<00:01:55.569> trim

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
haven't had an actual real all-over trim

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.380 
haven't had an actual real all-over trim
I've<00:01:56.110> only<00:01:56.679> trimmed<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.670> top<00:01:57.909> part<00:01:58.210> myself

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.059 
I've only trimmed the top part myself
and<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.869> didn't<00:01:59.140> really<00:01:59.229> touch<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.500> bottom<00:01:59.920> so

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
and I didn't really touch the bottom so

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.589 
and I didn't really touch the bottom so
it<00:02:00.159> became<00:02:00.399> uneven<00:02:00.909> so<00:02:01.149> that's<00:02:01.360> why<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.539> looks

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
it became uneven so that's why it looks

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.359

a lot of volume like I like it to look
towards<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> end<00:03:10.220> but<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> perfect

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
towards the end but this is a perfect

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.140 
towards the end but this is a perfect
amount<00:03:12.110> for<00:03:12.380> me

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.580 

for<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> last<00:03:23.480> step<00:03:23.720> I'm<00:03:23.900> applying<00:03:24.230> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
for the last step I'm applying this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.340 
for the last step I'm applying this
curls<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.430> flay<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.990> cream

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
curls to flay and this is just a cream

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.770 
curls to flay and this is just a cream
that's<00:03:27.620> going<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.100> hold<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.850> curl<00:03:29.150> together

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
that's going to hold the curl together

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.960 
that's going to hold the curl together
and<00:03:30.170> make<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.380> look<00:03:30.530> beautiful<00:03:30.890> once<00:03:31.520> it<00:03:31.730> dries

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and make it look beautiful once it dries

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.210 
and make it look beautiful once it dries
so<00:03:32.300> I'm<00:03:32.750> going<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.960> part<00:03:33.290> my<00:03:33.350> hair<00:03:33.710> on<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.190> top

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
so I'm going to part my hair on the top

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.700 
so I'm going to part my hair on the top
because<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.760> like<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.210> apply<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.170> top<00:03:36.380> part<00:03:36.650> of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
because I like to apply the top part of

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.640

my<00:03:36.770> hair<00:03:37.100> towards<00:03:37.940> down<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.320> creates

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
my hair towards down so that it creates

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.650 
my hair towards down so that it creates
more<00:03:39.770> volume<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> rest<00:03:41.210> of<00:03:41.360> my<00:03:41.480> hair
