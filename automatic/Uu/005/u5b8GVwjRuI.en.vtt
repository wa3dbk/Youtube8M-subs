00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
I'm just going to give it a squeeze and

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.110 
I'm just going to give it a squeeze and
there<00:02:34.379> we<00:02:34.470> go

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
there we go

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.449 
there we go
it's<00:02:36.120> very<00:02:36.299> clean<00:02:36.840> fluid<00:02:37.230> application<00:02:37.980> it's

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
it's very clean fluid application it's

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.339 
it's very clean fluid application it's
definitely<00:02:38.909> not<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.209> easy<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.510> use<00:02:39.629> as<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
definitely not as easy to use as like a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.869 
definitely not as easy to use as like a
ballpoint<00:02:40.859> pen<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.370> basically<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
ballpoint pen would be but basically it

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.970 
ballpoint pen would be but basically it
just<00:02:45.060> squeezes<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> thin<00:02:46.049> line<00:02:46.319> onto<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> nail

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
just squeezes a thin line onto the nail

just squeezes a thin line onto the nail

back together so yeah I'd say these ones

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.629 
back together so yeah I'd say these ones
a<00:03:04.139> better<00:03:04.319> quality<00:03:04.799> than<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.129> ones<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.459> got

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
a better quality than the ones I got

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.059 
a better quality than the ones I got
from<00:03:05.819> eBay<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.239> they<00:03:06.659> are<00:03:06.870> more<00:03:07.139> expensive<00:03:07.530> if

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
from eBay but they are more expensive if

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.830 
from eBay but they are more expensive if
I<00:03:08.220> recall<00:03:08.700> correctly<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.329> think<00:03:09.420> they're

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
I recall correctly I think they're

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.800 
I recall correctly I think they're
around<00:03:10.109> $3<00:03:10.799> each<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.849> that's<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.480> still

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
around $3 each so that's that's still

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.300 
around $3 each so that's that's still
pretty<00:03:13.019> good<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.680> eBay<00:03:13.950> ones<00:03:14.159> were

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
pretty good but the eBay ones were

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.589 
pretty good but the eBay ones were
cheaper<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.909> let<00:03:15.060> me<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.329> give<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
cheaper so let me just give you a

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.449 
cheaper so let me just give you a
demonstration<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.439> how<00:03:16.530> these<00:03:16.739> ones<00:03:16.980> are<00:03:17.189> just

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
demonstration of how these ones are just

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.520 
demonstration of how these ones are just
like<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.299> eBay<00:03:18.569> ones<00:03:18.780> these<00:03:19.109> ones<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
like the eBay ones these ones have a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.699 
like the eBay ones these ones have a
brush<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.750> these<00:03:21.750> these<00:03:22.109> brushes<00:03:22.440> are<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
brush and these these brushes are a

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.409 
brush and these these brushes are a
little<00:03:22.859> bit<00:03:23.040> stiffer<00:03:23.400> which<00:03:23.669> I<00:03:23.940> find<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.389> little

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
little bit stiffer which I find a little

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.869 
little bit stiffer which I find a little
bit<00:03:24.690> easier<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.470> work<00:03:25.650> with<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.280> stripe<00:03:26.609> onto

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
bit easier to work with and stripe onto

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.610 
bit easier to work with and stripe onto
the<00:03:26.970> nail<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.930> probably<00:03:28.230> won't<00:03:28.379> really<00:03:28.560> show

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the nail it's probably won't really show

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.520 
the nail it's probably won't really show
up<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:32.569> find<00:03:33.569> yeah<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.109> get<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> lot<00:03:34.500> more

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
up but I find yeah you get a lot more

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.770 
up but I find yeah you get a lot more
control<00:03:34.859> with<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> stiffer<00:03:35.730> brush<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.299> then

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
control with a stiffer brush and then

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.869 
control with a stiffer brush and then
the<00:03:36.959> Pens<00:03:37.230> these<00:03:37.739> are<00:03:37.919> slightly<00:03:38.220> longer<00:03:38.669> than

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
the Pens these are slightly longer than

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.920 
the Pens these are slightly longer than
the<00:03:39.030> eBay<00:03:39.449> ones<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.519> go<00:03:41.900> they're<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the eBay ones just how it go they're a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.580 
the eBay ones just how it go they're a
lot<00:03:43.409> harder<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.949> squeeze<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.900> plastic<00:03:46.109> is

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
lot harder to squeeze the plastic is

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.969 
lot harder to squeeze the plastic is
thicker<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.840> put<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.769> real

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
thicker so you have to put some real

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.189 
thicker so you have to put some real
force<00:03:50.310> into<00:03:50.639> squeezing<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.209> okay<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:51.930> this

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
force into squeezing that okay so this

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.990 
force into squeezing that okay so this
is<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.500> pink<00:03:52.970> glossy<00:03:53.970> blossom<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:55.819> this<00:03:56.819> is

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
is the pink glossy blossom one this is

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.490 
is the pink glossy blossom one this is
fairly<00:03:57.269> watery<00:03:57.659> just<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.169> other<00:03:58.290> ones

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
fairly watery just like the other ones

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990 
fairly watery just like the other ones
but<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> think<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:59.040> might<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.430> be<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.579> thing

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
but I think that might just be a thing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.119 
but I think that might just be a thing
with<00:04:00.299> nail<00:04:00.780> art<00:04:01.049> pens<00:04:01.349> because<00:04:01.739> they<00:04:01.859> have<00:04:02.010> to

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
with nail art pens because they have to

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.839 
with nail art pens because they have to
be<00:04:02.220> able<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.489> come<00:04:02.699> out<00:04:03.229> fluidly<00:04:04.229> and<00:04:04.500> not<00:04:04.849> clog

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
be able to come out fluidly and not clog

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.129 
be able to come out fluidly and not clog
up<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.479> sticky<00:04:07.139> so<00:04:08.810> yeah<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.959> works

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
up and be sticky so yeah that works

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.490 
up and be sticky so yeah that works
pretty<00:04:10.409> good<00:04:11.629> okay<00:04:12.629> so<00:04:12.690> there<00:04:13.019> were<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.290> two

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
pretty good okay so there were the two

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.159 
pretty good okay so there were the two
brands<00:04:14.069> of<00:04:14.280> nail<00:04:14.489> art<00:04:14.639> pens<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.449> I

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.500 
brands of nail art pens that I have I
really<00:04:16.620> like<00:04:16.799> them<00:04:17.010> both<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:18.150> don't<00:04:18.209> regret

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
really like them both and I don't regret

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.539 
really like them both and I don't regret
buying<00:04:18.870> them<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:19.829> if<00:04:20.039> I<00:04:20.099> had<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.340> pick<00:04:20.519> between

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
buying them but if I had to pick between

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.370 
buying them but if I had to pick between
the<00:04:20.940> two<00:04:20.970> I'd<00:04:21.269> say<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.659> like<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.079> glossy

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the two I'd say that I like the glossy

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.480 
the two I'd say that I like the glossy
blossom<00:04:22.889> ones<00:04:23.070> better

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
blossom ones better

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.790 
blossom ones better
purely<00:04:24.120> because<00:04:24.330> they<00:04:24.990> come<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.380> lot<00:04:25.560> nicer

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
purely because they come in a lot nicer

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.730 
purely because they come in a lot nicer
colors<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.820> because<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.719> the<00:04:27.900> cute<00:04:28.139> packaging

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
colors and because of the cute packaging

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.090 
colors and because of the cute packaging
and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.350 
and
I<00:04:29.130> could<00:04:29.430> pick<00:04:29.610> them<00:04:29.730> all<00:04:29.880> individually

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I could pick them all individually

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.320 
I could pick them all individually
because<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.260> didn't<00:04:31.500> buy<00:04:31.620> them<00:04:31.770> online<00:04:32.000> but<00:04:33.000> if

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
because I didn't buy them online but if

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.180 
because I didn't buy them online but if
you're<00:04:33.600> starting<00:04:33.840> out<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:34.290> nail<00:04:34.500> art<00:04:34.740> pens<00:04:34.980> I

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
you're starting out with nail art pens I

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.740 
you're starting out with nail art pens I
would<00:04:35.400> recommend<00:04:35.820> buying<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> eBay<00:04:36.480> set

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
would recommend buying the eBay set

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.560 
would recommend buying the eBay set
purely<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:37.530> they're<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:37.920> cheap<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.570> if

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
purely because they're so cheap and if

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.300 
purely because they're so cheap and if
you<00:04:39.720> decide<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:40.230> not<00:04:40.380> your<00:04:40.530> thing<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.070> won't

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
you decide it's not your thing it won't

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.920 
you decide it's not your thing it won't
really<00:04:41.490> matter<00:04:41.610> too<00:04:42.000> much<00:04:42.090> because<00:04:42.540> they're

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
really matter too much because they're

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.800 
really matter too much because they're
less<00:04:43.110> than<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.290> dollar<00:04:43.590> each<00:04:43.890> because<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.970> ten

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
less than a dollar each because it's ten

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.360 
less than a dollar each because it's ten
dollars<00:04:45.960> for<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.320> pack<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.590> twelve<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.190> that's

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
dollars for a pack of twelve and that's

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.180 
dollars for a pack of twelve and that's
an<00:04:47.550> Australian<00:04:47.850> dollars<00:04:48.390> by<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.570> way<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.680> yeah

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
an Australian dollars by the way so yeah

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.550 
an Australian dollars by the way so yeah
I<00:04:50.220> think<00:04:50.460> but<00:04:51.240> both<00:04:51.540> are<00:04:51.750> really<00:04:51.960> good<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:52.410> I

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
I think but both are really good but I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.520 
I think but both are really good but I
like<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.860> glossy<00:04:53.010> blossoms<00:04:53.550> better<00:04:54.500> okay<00:04:55.500> so

like the glossy blossoms better okay so

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.870 
like the glossy blossoms better okay so
