what are these thought the collapse of
Arsenal<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.840> I'll<00:03:46.930> start<00:03:47.110> going<00:03:47.260> through

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
Arsenal I think I'll start going through

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.270 
Arsenal I think I'll start going through
a<00:03:47.530> difficult<00:03:47.799> period

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
a difficult period

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.030 
a difficult period
I<00:03:49.260> think<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> cycle<00:03:50.769> of<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:53.230> new<00:03:53.620> players<00:03:53.890> will

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
I think the cycle of of new players will

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.990 
I think the cycle of of new players will
start<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.680> never<00:03:56.860> easy<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.790> change

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
start now and it never easy to change

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.089 
start now and it never easy to change
you<00:03:58.390> know<00:03:58.510> from<00:03:58.540> ex<00:03:59.140> generation<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.890> a<00:03:59.920> new

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
you know from ex generation to a new

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.809 
you know from ex generation to a new
generation<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:02.920> think<00:04:03.129> this<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.700> maybe

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
generation and and I think this is maybe

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.070 
generation and and I think this is maybe
the<00:04:04.000> one<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> most<00:04:04.750> difficult<00:04:05.200> for<00:04:05.920> us

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.430 

it's<00:04:11.080> really<00:04:11.319> difficult<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:12.780> do<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:14.019> explain

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
it's really difficult to do to explain

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.370 
it's really difficult to do to explain
and<00:04:15.150> because<00:04:16.150> when<00:04:16.330> you're<00:04:16.450> not<00:04:16.630> involved

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
and because when you're not involved

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.870 
and because when you're not involved
inside<00:04:17.919> when<00:04:18.130> you're<00:04:18.250> not<00:04:18.370> there<00:04:18.549> every<00:04:18.849> day

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
inside when you're not there every day

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.330 
inside when you're not there every day
is<00:04:19.060> really<00:04:19.269> difficult<00:04:19.840> up<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.049> nobody<00:04:20.349> know

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
is really difficult up in nobody know

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.460 
is really difficult up in nobody know
better<00:04:21.580> than<00:04:21.760> arson<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.330> it's<00:04:22.870> also<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.320> keep

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
better than arson and it's also and keep

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.740 
better than arson and it's also and keep
faith<00:04:23.740> in<00:04:23.979> these<00:04:24.160> players<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.390> Football

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
faith in these players and this Football

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.360 
faith in these players and this Football
Club<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.500> know<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:26.860> what<00:04:27.220> you're
