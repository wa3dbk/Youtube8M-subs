the hidden release and the button in the
handle<00:02:04.370> with<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> spring<00:02:05.600> assisted<00:02:06.080> knife

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
handle with a spring assisted knife

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.160 
handle with a spring assisted knife
there<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.869> no<00:02:09.080> button<00:02:09.320> in<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> handle<00:02:11.170> it's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
there is no button in the handle it's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.230 
there is no button in the handle it's
triggered<00:02:12.680> by<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.280> thumb<00:02:13.580> stud<00:02:14.000> that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
triggered by this thumb stud that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.240 
triggered by this thumb stud that
protrudes<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> blade

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.090 

and<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.880> helps<00:02:19.150> propel<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> knife<00:02:19.930> open

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.510 

alright<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.460> thumb<00:02:24.670> side<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:29.340> right<00:02:30.340> in

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
alright in the thumb side all right in

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:39.020 
alright in the thumb side all right in
the<00:02:30.670> thumb<00:02:30.880> stead

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.940 

this<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.270> has<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> flipper<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.200> back<00:02:41.380> but

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
this one has a flipper on the back but

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.410 
this one has a flipper on the back but
still<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> part<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.880> blade<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
still is a part of the blade so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.180 
still is a part of the blade so
therefore<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.600> too<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.350> spring-assisted

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
therefore it too is a spring-assisted

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.900 
therefore it too is a spring-assisted
