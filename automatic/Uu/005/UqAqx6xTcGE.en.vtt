 so this is the ontario rate one 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.560
 roundhouse adventure training that we can 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.900
 see here so really a knife that has 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.450
 a superb reputation at report level 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.240
 a sheikh we are below the bar 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.020

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 here it is really super good quality 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.030
 I'm going to open it language without more 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.730
 expect 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 so this is the model towards military with 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.030
 black coating finish combo lo 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 so here it is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.600
 so there at the platelets we have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.600
 for the belt clip 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.470
 So that's so well thought we have to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.250
 inside the small plates 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.869

 Here it is 8.7 cm 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.329
