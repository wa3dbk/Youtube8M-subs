00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 I hope you like it and it's good 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.769
 tell me how did you think about it and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.330
 how did they fit in after 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.360
 have done right away happened to them 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.540
 ingredients the ingredients that are going 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.640
 to use are the following 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.990
 here I already have egg whites separated 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.880
 they need about 4 egg whites 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.210
 what a beautiful half apple 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.750
 red or green does not matter a few sticks of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 cinnamon this I already had I have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.520
 This also depends on the taste but they 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.370
 I say that later you can depend on doing 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.580
 force the taste of bread 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.290
 they go in caravan of about two to three 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.550
 fists of oats and this already depends on your 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.500
 diet of the amount of carbohydrates 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.380
 that are going to be ingesting me 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.390
 I recommend about two three this 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 a lot of oatmeal for a single serving 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 you need also here I have protein 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.229
 vanilla flavor whey routine 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.710
 this is going to be more than anything a plus 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.659
 of plus protein that is for bread 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 and the vanilla flavor is then going to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.500
 be very very rich that's why if you do not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 have not worry do not worry 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 can can supply the per chocolate in 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.500
 dust over here I have this thing then 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.390
 is going to give the chocolate flavor or 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 it can be vanilla essence of all 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.240
 forms this because it contains protein 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 also that plus a and from there we can 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 grab at once I'll put them as 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.050
 the preparation this this preparation 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 it is very easy 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:06.240
 is the following the following is easy 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.330
 has been a little more practical now well 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.420
 you can let's hear the clear ones of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420
 egg 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.120
 I told them 3 2 to 3 points more or less 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.670
 the recovery the day after 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.540
 gym why I tell you 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.829
 It's a good breakfast 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.829
 immediately we will put our hands 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:03.080
 and well the protein I told you before 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:07.580
 can supply them for chocolate 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.170
 the amount of sun made about 23 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.870
 East spoons 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.420
 of chocolate or with the protein 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 Well, that's enough for a 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.150
 good flavor and vanilla essence 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 immediately then nothing else is this 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.310
 in a matter of him equal 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.520
 so they have a little thick to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.900
 that is more equal and that yes nothing else a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.900
 little good 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.760
 more or less that way it is a little thick 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.040
 yes he is the pasta 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.500
 already with this what what he continues to do 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.730
 and well, there are two ways to be able 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.540
 make bread one can be in a 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.449
 Teflon casserole put it put it to 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.789
 low fire be until it is cooked 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.130
 covered until it is spongy 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.570
 caring or the other way the good way 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.120
 it's easier for me to do it 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.650
 in the microwave emptying it in some 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.900
 container that is a little big 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.420
 since it's going to inflate and it goes and it's going to 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.470
 puff up 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.470
 it goes towards everything 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.919
 in this is perfect 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.510
 and good this already with more or less already 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.080
 depends on the heat of your microwave and 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.070
 well here I put him about 15 or 5 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 minutes more or less to bread and this and 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.740
 It's done right away I'm going to show you 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.230
 already after having put it into 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.260
 microwave how is that something like that is 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.940
 as it is already fresh out of the oven 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.160
 notice how good it is that there is a 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.230
 little fluff that is not so watery 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.700
 so that it is like as bread but that 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.430
 You can put more time 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.840
 microwave so that it continues cooking already 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 to serve it because nothing else can be 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.259
 Give can be turned 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.259
 or something like that 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.740
 give a little honey what they like what 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.820
 that they are allowed in their diet as they already 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.110
 see then it is that it is very pretty 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.600
 presentation the truth is that I do not know 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.970
 you, well 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.510
 and there was no need to add flour or 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.490
 fat or anything else because it remains 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.010
 it is very good that it was very rich it is easy 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.020
 to do I hope you tell me how 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.660
 they were like what did they like a 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.770
 taste or not and also took as 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.390
 to tell them to subscribe to me 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.010

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.920
 helping them and that they liked
