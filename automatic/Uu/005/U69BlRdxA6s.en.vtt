00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
anyway let's move on to just some kind

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000 
anyway let's move on to just some kind
of<00:00:58.829> an<00:00:58.949> overview<00:00:59.100> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.920> my

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of an overview kind of what it's what my

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.170 
of an overview kind of what it's what my
experiences<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.670> been<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.409> KitKat<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.589> far

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
experiences have been with KitKat so far

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.929 
experiences have been with KitKat so far
battery<00:01:06.180> life<00:01:06.360> has<00:01:06.900> been<00:01:07.860> pretty<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.400> four

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
battery life has been pretty good four

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
battery life has been pretty good four
hours<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.330> screen<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.280> six

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
hours of screen time it's about six

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
hours of screen time it's about six
hours<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> battery<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.500> haven't<00:01:14.070> really

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
hours on the battery I haven't really

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
hours on the battery I haven't really
used<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.640> else<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.390> trying<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> do

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
used much else I'm just trying to do

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.190 
used much else I'm just trying to do
kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> stress<00:01:16.500> test<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> battery

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
kind of a stress test for the battery

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
kind of a stress test for the battery
mainly<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> screen<00:01:19.830> usually<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
mainly for the screen usually it's the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
mainly for the screen usually it's the
biggest<00:01:21.900> draw<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.470> power<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> battery

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
biggest draw of power from the battery

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.390 
biggest draw of power from the battery
so<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.900> i'm<00:01:24.990> using<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.380> test<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.220> do

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so that's what i'm using my test to do

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
so that's what i'm using my test to do
it's<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.210> forty<00:01:27.570> four<00:01:27.750> percent<00:01:27.780> i

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's not about forty four percent i

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's not about forty four percent i
usually<00:01:29.250> only<00:01:29.570> aim<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.470> two<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.820> three

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
usually only aim for about two to three

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.950 
usually only aim for about two to three
hours<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.740> screen<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.799> per<00:01:35.520> day<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hours of screen time per day this is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.420 
hours of screen time per day this is
again<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> stress<00:01:38.040> test<00:01:39.409> overall<00:01:40.430> 4.4

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
again this is a stress test overall 4.4

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.679 
again this is a stress test overall 4.4
is<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:42.180> smooth<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:44.009> into<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> Apps

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
is very smooth if we go into the Apps

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.399 
is very smooth if we go into the Apps
section<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.140> show<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> memory<00:01:49.950> usage

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
section and show you the memory usage

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
section and show you the memory usage
internal<00:01:52.409> storage<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.040> give<00:01:53.970> or<00:01:54.119> take

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
internal storage and give or take

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
internal storage and give or take
depending<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:54.869> many<00:01:54.930> apps<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.560> but

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
depending on how many apps you have but

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
depending on how many apps you have but
it's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.310> very<00:01:56.549> generous<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.030> begin<00:01:57.390> with

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it's not very generous to begin with

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.170 
it's not very generous to begin with
it's<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:57.960> about<00:01:58.049> seven<00:01:58.560> seven<00:01:59.040> gigs<00:01:59.250> free

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it's only about seven seven gigs free

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's only about seven seven gigs free
probably<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.500> SD<00:02:01.799> card<00:02:02.030> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
probably want to get an SD card but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.230 
probably want to get an SD card but
moving<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.659> memory<00:02:04.200> usage<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.799> about<00:02:05.430> 700

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
moving on to memory usage is about 700

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
this is probably about two or three

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
the benefits just a couple more app

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.330 
the benefits just a couple more app
function<00:04:09.900> couple<00:04:10.200> more<00:04:10.350> features<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:11.070> app

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
function couple more features of app

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.979 
function couple more features of app
functionality<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.459> original<00:04:15.239> demo<00:04:15.660> was

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
functionality and the original demo was

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.110 
functionality and the original demo was
only<00:04:16.200> 30<00:04:16.410> seconds<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.859> recording<00:04:17.280> time<00:04:17.310> you're

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
only 30 seconds of recording time you're

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.680 
only 30 seconds of recording time you're
now<00:04:18.419> up<00:04:19.230> to<00:04:19.440> an<00:04:19.560> hour<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:20.100> recording<00:04:20.730> time<00:04:20.760> so

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
now up to an hour of recording time so

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.510 
now up to an hour of recording time so
that's<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.229> mean<00:04:22.350> that's<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:22.979> reasonably

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
that's I mean that's that's reasonably

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.730 
that's I mean that's that's reasonably
long<00:04:23.729> for<00:04:24.090> just<00:04:24.270> about<00:04:24.360> any<00:04:24.660> anybody's<00:04:25.650> uses
