think<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.260> can<00:05:27.289> buy<00:05:27.530> tickets<00:05:27.590> via<00:05:28.250> ITV

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
think that you can buy tickets via ITV

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.510 
think that you can buy tickets via ITV
if<00:05:29.539> you<00:05:29.690> guys<00:05:29.810> remember<00:05:29.900> on<00:05:30.350> my<00:05:30.380> other<00:05:31.130> video

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
if you guys remember on my other video

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.510 
if you guys remember on my other video
showing<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.090> application<00:05:32.780> called<00:05:32.990> movies

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
showing the application called movies

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.240 
showing the application called movies
which<00:05:34.520> was<00:05:34.700> a<00:05:34.729> lot<00:05:35.090> similar<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.630> ITV<00:05:36.190> but<00:05:37.190> the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
which was a lot similar to ITV but the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.680 
which was a lot similar to ITV but the
only<00:05:37.370> difference<00:05:37.460> was<00:05:37.760> that<00:05:37.820> on<00:05:38.090> movies<00:05:38.479> you

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
only difference was that on movies you

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.029 
only difference was that on movies you
would<00:05:38.810> be<00:05:38.930> able<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.140> purchase<00:05:39.410> your<00:05:39.710> tickets

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
would be able to purchase your tickets

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.640 
would be able to purchase your tickets
via<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.270> application<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.110> i<00:05:42.140> could<00:05:42.289> buy<00:05:42.440> them

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
via that application so i could buy them

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.380 
via that application so i could buy them
then<00:05:42.770> i<00:05:42.800> can<00:05:42.919> go<00:05:42.950> pick<00:05:43.190> them<00:05:43.250> up<00:05:43.370> in<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.580> up<00:05:43.669> at

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
then i can go pick them up in the up at

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.630 
then i can go pick them up in the up at
the<00:05:44.510> movie<00:05:44.720> theater<00:05:44.990> but<00:05:45.620> for<00:05:45.860> icv<00:05:46.280> i<00:05:46.310> don't

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
the movie theater but for icv i don't

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.670 
the movie theater but for icv i don't
think<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:47.030> i<00:05:47.450> don't<00:05:47.660> think<00:05:48.229> that<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.380> can<00:05:48.410> bond

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680
