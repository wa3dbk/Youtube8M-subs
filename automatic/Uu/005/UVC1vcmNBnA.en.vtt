pressure<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> quarterback<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.260> if<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pressure on the quarterback which if the

offensive<00:01:24.390> line<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.440> think<00:01:25.650> Seattle

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
offensive line I got to think Seattle

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
offensive line I got to think Seattle
minus<00:01:26.490> 3<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> pickier<00:01:27.119> even<00:01:27.299> though<00:01:27.360> it's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
minus 3 is the pickier even though it's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.539 
minus 3 is the pickier even though it's
kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> obvious<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.350> Jeff

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
kind of obvious what do you think Jeff
