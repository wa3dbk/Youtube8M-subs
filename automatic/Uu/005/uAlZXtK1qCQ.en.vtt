00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.580

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.560
 Hello everyone guys with you channel chef one 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.290
 VKontakte Chap Mei we and Merman and 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.170
 this is an extraordinary video on request 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.020
 subscribers I decided to make a wand 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.970
 harry potter ah magic wand guys 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.470
 often asked i promised promised u not 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.630
 so how can I not do it all the same 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.230
 decided after today's message 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.180
 VKontakte release this video she 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.790
 It will be very short because 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.330
 This technique will tell for students 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.010
 more than for professionals but 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.780
 less you can become the owner 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.200
 magic wand what you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.610
 need this stick for sushi for 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 rolls thread you can take anything 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 string pebbles and so on it's easy for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.800
 I decided to make jewelry 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 wrap the handle looked more stove-setter 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.440
 will affect the glue gun 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 this in order to create itself 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.910
 a handle that will hold well 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 later on and painted in acrylic 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.200
 Paints brush we varnish I 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.320
 chose matte varnish and glossy you can 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.440
 take any acrylic alkyd paint well 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440
 go 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440
 but 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.500
 mother 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420
 we 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.600
 Well guys here so that's magic 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.930
 wand we got it done 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.660
 literally in two three minutes let's say it 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.400
 so more to amuse 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.560
 kiddies or harry potter lovers 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 Particularly easy work of course you can and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.240
 perform an order of magnitude better but it's more 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.190
 demo version let's say for 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.620
 guys who can not wait 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.350
 make her magic wand and go 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.070
 play friends probably because 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.600
 all the same writing audience 10 12 years for 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.940
 here are such things 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.560
 but nonetheless I think their 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 the requirement must be fulfilled on the channel 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.610
 therefore it was not difficult 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.340
 you can do this kind of work now 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.350
 speak all sorts of spells i think that 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.920
 harry potter watched by type 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.290
 mingaleeva was driven and stuff I think it is 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.810
 funny well if you liked 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.180
 this video put your thumbs up 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.980
 up subscribe to the channel i think 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110
 that shorts will also be 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.520
 enough for people who want 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.910
 dilute your leisure 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.650
 Well, soon I think that we 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.480
 fulfilled with you after all promised 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.240
 you lead which is, if you honestly topic 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.900
