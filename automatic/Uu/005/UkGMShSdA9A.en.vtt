00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
making this video I found these pictures

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.110 
making this video I found these pictures
of<00:00:36.190> Datsun<00:00:37.219> f10

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
of Datsun f10

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.850 
of Datsun f10
from<00:00:38.539> end<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.260> 70s<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.100> they<00:00:41.059> actually

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
from end of 70s and they actually

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.549 
from end of 70s and they actually
comparison<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:43.129> Datsun<00:00:44.030> f10<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:45.199> Juke

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
comparison of Datsun f10 and this Juke

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.650 
comparison of Datsun f10 and this Juke
that<00:00:46.309> a<00:00:46.579> lot<00:00:46.789> of<00:00:47.140> outside<00:00:48.140> design<00:00:48.620> components

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
that a lot of outside design components

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.930 
that a lot of outside design components
came<00:00:50.660> from<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.289> on<00:00:51.500> f10<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.519> guess<00:00:52.789> it

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
came from that's on f10 and I guess it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.080 
came from that's on f10 and I guess it
makes<00:00:53.090> sense<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.960> gives<00:00:54.019> a<00:00:54.260> lot<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:55.090> designers

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
makes sense it gives a lot of designers

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.750 
makes sense it gives a lot of designers
get<00:00:56.300> their<00:00:56.510> inspiration<00:00:57.140> from<00:00:57.260> older<00:00:57.890> cars

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
get their inspiration from older cars

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.240 
get their inspiration from older cars
and<00:00:59.410> this<00:01:00.410> is<00:01:00.649> one<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> examples<00:01:02.359> and

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
and this is one of the examples and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.300 
and this is one of the examples and
judge<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.400> for<00:01:04.430> yourself<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.500> currently

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
judge it for yourself and currently

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.429 
judge it for yourself and currently
there<00:01:07.490> are<00:01:07.520> two<00:01:07.790> plans<00:01:08.090> where<00:01:08.750> these<00:01:09.140> things

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
there are two plans where these things

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.149 
there are two plans where these things
are<00:01:09.770> made<00:01:10.460> one<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.479> UK<00:01:11.659> by<00:01:12.619> Nissan

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
are made one is in the UK by Nissan

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.749 
are made one is in the UK by Nissan
manufacturing<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.270> UK<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:15.380> makes<00:01:15.759> cars

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
manufacturing of the UK that makes cars

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.520 
manufacturing of the UK that makes cars
for<00:01:17.090> Europe<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.780> rest<00:01:18.049> of<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.320> world

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
for Europe and the rest of the world

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.800 
for Europe and the rest of the world
they're<00:01:18.799> front-wheel<00:01:19.310> drive<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.909> another's

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
they're front-wheel drive and another's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.499 
they're front-wheel drive and another's
in<00:01:20.990> Japan<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.400> know<00:01:22.549> for<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:22.970> many<00:01:23.030> people

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
in Japan and I know for so many people

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.960 
in Japan and I know for so many people
it<00:01:23.689> is<00:01:23.840> important<00:01:24.380> where<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.770> Japanese<00:01:25.610> cars

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
it is important where it Japanese cars

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.080 
it is important where it Japanese cars
actually<00:01:26.619> assembled<00:01:27.729> because<00:01:28.729> there<00:01:28.880> are<00:01:28.939> so

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually assembled because there are so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.450 
actually assembled because there are so
many<00:01:29.150> assembly<00:01:29.780> plants<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.500> Japanese<00:01:31.100> cars

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
many assembly plants of Japanese cars

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.609 
many assembly plants of Japanese cars
around<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.149> world<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.049> if<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.409> buy

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
around the world so if you buy

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.520 
around the world so if you buy
four-wheel-drive<00:01:34.100> Juke<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.360> will<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.930> made<00:01:36.229> in

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
four-wheel-drive Juke it will be made in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.310 
four-wheel-drive Juke it will be made in
Japan<00:01:36.950> only<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.640> if<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.210> buy<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.540> front-wheel

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
Japan only and if you buy a front-wheel

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.520 
Japan only and if you buy a front-wheel
drive<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:40.100> will<00:01:40.369> be<00:01:40.640> from<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.600> UK<00:01:42.020> assembly

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
drive it will be from the UK assembly

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.980 
drive it will be from the UK assembly
plant<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.399> finally<00:01:46.969> let's<00:01:47.210> see<00:01:47.509> what<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:47.960> have

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
plant so finally let's see what we have

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.350 
plant so finally let's see what we have
inside<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.719> SL<00:01:50.719> version<00:01:51.290> or<00:01:51.469> trim<00:01:51.920> level

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
inside it is SL version or trim level

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.679 
inside it is SL version or trim level
whatever<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.770> starts<00:01:55.189> with

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
whatever you like and it starts with

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.740 
whatever you like and it starts with
$25,000<00:01:56.689> base<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:58.579> now<00:01:59.000> let's<00:01:59.240> take<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.479> look

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
$25,000 base and now let's take a look

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.350 
$25,000 base and now let's take a look
at<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.079> gauge<00:02:00.439> cluster<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.820> has<00:02:02.060> very

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
at the gauge cluster it has very

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.109 
at the gauge cluster it has very
original<00:02:02.899> design<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.310> actually<00:02:04.670> came

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
original design and it actually came

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.889 
original design and it actually came
from<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.630> concept<00:02:06.500> car<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:08.210> speedometer<00:02:08.720> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
from the concept car the speedometer and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
itself it's like a new trend on all the

itself it's like a new trend on all the
special<00:02:57.860> Japanese<00:02:58.340> cars<00:02:59.350> it<00:03:00.350> has<00:03:00.710> no<00:03:00.980> gear<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
special Japanese cars it has no gear and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.870 
special Japanese cars it has no gear and
like<00:03:02.480> one<00:03:02.870> giant<00:03:03.140> gear<00:03:03.590> pushing<00:03:04.160> gas<00:03:04.370> harder

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
like one giant gear pushing gas harder

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.700 
like one giant gear pushing gas harder
go<00:03:05.150> faster<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:07.630> theoretically<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.990> tends<00:03:09.440> to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
go faster and theoretically it tends to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.180 
go faster and theoretically it tends to
save<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.400> gas<00:03:11.270> that's<00:03:11.690> all<00:03:11.960> it<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.740> here

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
save you gas that's all it is and here

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.550 
save you gas that's all it is and here
below<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.790> your<00:03:14.180> climate<00:03:14.840> control<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
below you have your climate control and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.090 
below you have your climate control and
it<00:03:16.310> also<00:03:16.490> shares<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.600> screen<00:03:18.050> with<00:03:18.440> driving

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
it also shares the screen with driving

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.670 
it also shares the screen with driving
modes<00:03:19.520> which<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.390> kind<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.230> strange<00:03:21.530> thing

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
modes which is kind of a strange thing

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.860 
modes which is kind of a strange thing
because<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.640> climate<00:03:23.390> control<00:03:23.720> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
because those climate control and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.840 
because those climate control and
driving<00:03:24.200> most<00:03:24.350> don't<00:03:24.709> have<00:03:25.040> nothing<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.580> do

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
driving most don't have nothing to do

and<00:04:27.330> usually<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.200> don't<00:04:28.410> do<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.250> this

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
and usually I don't do this but this

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.340 
and usually I don't do this but this
time<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.880> will<00:04:30.120> try<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.330> make<00:04:30.660> some<00:04:30.930> kind<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.230> a
