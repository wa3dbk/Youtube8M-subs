 great big evening and hoping that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.240
 fabrizio ferri may be yours 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.530

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.890
 your name we are waiting for it 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.250
 staff that organizes all his 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.080
 fabrizio excited tools let's say 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.600
 that every performance there is always a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.569
 little bit of emotion if not there is not 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.880
 artist if you are not excited but will be 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.450
 an expert for whom I see little 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.150
 I found a fairly rich resume 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 well despite that and for us this is the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.730
 work, however, there must be emotion 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.989
 always a little bit if not to say 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.780
 that if there is no motion and there is no 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.260
 feeling there is no love of this 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.269
 craft what you read from the eyes 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.530
 and from your words and the humility to do the 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.500
 singer and this is something that 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.540
 I really appreciate the chapel, though 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.900
 I'm curious to know the song that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.599
 feel more but we talk about this 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.040

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.450

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.110

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.569
