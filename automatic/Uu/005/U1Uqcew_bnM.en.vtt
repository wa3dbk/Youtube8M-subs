00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.490
 we run as an experimental psychologist 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.669
 it's always opportunities 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.659
 also worked with birds 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.659
 hello studied 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.869
 he therefore needed a number of adjustments with exactly the same 80 ounces 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.749
 c 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.920
 the mutual relationships once they are born 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790
 an operation received the entire project and plenty of food 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 thales i thought the young monkey could grow 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 but malfunctions nevertheless occurred 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.680
 on his own films it can be seen that the females then got the whole boy 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.100
 became bad mothers 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 which the boy went to dig creatively 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.300
 everyone was surprised that mothers treated the young as discouraged 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.540
 parasites 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.400
 Haro saw similarities with mothers who abuse their children 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 and decided to do research 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.170
 week had that work in her youth on something to smoke 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.430
 and that is why she behaved so heartlessly 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.500
 but what 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 sij 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 arno experimented with various models 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 to find out a little younger from their mothers lower 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 here the tub can choose from two so happy mothers 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.730
 one of the council 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.230
 with a bottle of milk 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 and their bags for mother without milk 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.779
 he records the results on the film and showed it to his students 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.529
 he first told what surrogate mothers to leave them 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:13.759
 and not seeing what kind of problems had been involved with what result who is 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.299
 directly this area was the keepers 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.179
 it is very happy with it 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 I get 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.799
 So far three sets against daughter growth may be the most important food 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.799
 reward was at the onset of injured 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.549
 if so 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 so the monkey had to be the surrogate mother who gave milk 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.839
 prefer 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.839
 and open in danger seek refuge 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.469
 her roots experiments others believe that idea 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.349
 when they turned chris brown 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 and so always with the gentle mothers, among other things 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.819
 feelings contact was therefore sometimes more important than eating 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:11.179
 Hello her eyes on how important the mother was as if base 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.999
 from there the young animal known the world 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.619
 without her rest and a presence 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.359
 Everything in 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.059
 when a surrogate mother is pushed in 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.619
 regain the self-confidence of the monkeys 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.619
 now he can explore his surroundings 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.949
 Also share was on this you can see what role real should steal in it 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.949
 raising their children 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.339
 the news that di rupo is a small island in the caribbean sea 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.719

 six large group a reader were evicted 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.399
 since then there has been constant research into the shared playing zone high interest rates 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:04.749
 and psychologists 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.749
 the island is also a kind of air laboratory 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.229
 instinctively and mother stuck in ukraine 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.229
 and fled back to him when something frightened them 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.270

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.000
 a young boy has to learn how to deal with peers and you have to go for it 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.060
 can take care of themselves cheers 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.720
 but if they play a little too much I have 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.830
 back to mother 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 is with him and soft and also has milk 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.729
 herlo says a surrogate mother didn't have that 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.430

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.300
 peak on a handsome 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.089
 that will literally teach him 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.089
 this is how he learns to behave in the group 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.909
 how important contact with peers she lacks always has laboratory attic 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.460

 Monkeys that give you a toll system every day rise reasonably functioning beers 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:40.429
 even though they didn't have a mother sister 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.400

 on this island, for example, they like to play in the water 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.539
 they are first introduced to this poll when their mother starts drinking 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.559
 first she said very wary 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.559
 and this is not what they should do 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.999
 but if their mother is in the neighborhood they dare to go exploring 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.500

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:06.960
 hind legs 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960
