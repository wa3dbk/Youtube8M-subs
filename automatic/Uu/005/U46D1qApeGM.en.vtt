but in his bed is will rain and that's

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780

why<00:02:28.990> Broner<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.650> be<00:02:29.800> hit<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.160> spite<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.550> all

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
why Broner can be hit in spite of all

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.340 
why Broner can be hit in spite of all
the<00:02:30.910> physical<00:02:31.060> advantages<00:02:31.750> whose<00:02:31.990> Broner

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the physical advantages whose Broner

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.730 
the physical advantages whose Broner
enters<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.070> ring<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.940> hurt<00:02:34.360> his<00:02:34.570> opponent<00:02:35.110> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.030 
enters the ring to hurt his opponent and
I<00:02:35.830> think<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.280> more<00:02:37.090> than<00:02:37.590> wrapping<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
I think that more than wrapping on the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.700 
I think that more than wrapping on the
way<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> ring<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.020> clowning<00:02:41.020> at<00:02:41.320> all<00:02:41.470> that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
way to the ring and clowning at all that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.470 
way to the ring and clowning at all that
that's<00:02:42.100> what's<00:02:42.400> connecting<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.240> fans

stuff to do damage one hundred percent

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.250
