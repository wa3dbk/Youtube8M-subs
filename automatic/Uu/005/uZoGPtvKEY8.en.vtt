00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
than I was expecting but let's put that
to<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.619> side<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.129> moment<00:02:08.280> show<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> what

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to one side for a moment show you what

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
to one side for a moment show you what
else<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> box<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
else we get in the box so we get a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
else we get in the box so we get a
couple<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.520> stuff<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
couple of stuff and this

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.610 
couple of stuff and this
really<00:02:13.170> weird<00:02:13.709> wacky<00:02:14.130> rice<00:02:15.090> paper<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
really weird wacky rice paper we get a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620 
really weird wacky rice paper we get a
two-pin<00:02:17.400> charger<00:02:17.849> we're<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> Middle

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
two-pin charger we're here in the Middle

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.589 
two-pin charger we're here in the Middle
East<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.340> gonna<00:02:20.459> vary<00:02:20.940> depending<00:02:21.510> on

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
East so this is gonna vary depending on

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.100 
East so this is gonna vary depending on
where<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:24.000> charger<00:02:24.959> as

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
where you are but we get a charger as

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.080 
where you are but we get a charger as
well<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> two-pin<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.349> there<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.090> we

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
well so it's a two-pin one there and we

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.470 
well so it's a two-pin one there and we
also<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.580> pair<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:34.610> hcc<00:02:35.610> headphones<00:02:36.239> which
