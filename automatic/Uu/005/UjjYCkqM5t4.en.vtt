00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello everyone here I stayed and today good and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.670
 we're 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.830
 a little different something that I bring you 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.900
 normally but good still having 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.870
 what to do with football today I am going to make you a 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.059
 small tutorial os bens on some websites 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.110
 where you can create your 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.150
 totally free football lineups 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.289
 the first of all is called soccer 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.080
 giuseppe puntocom 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.900
 in which we can stay alignment 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.780
 As you can see here we have to choose from 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.880
 team we can choose national teams 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.230
 how is he injured now 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.220
 ok or we can take team team 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.220
 false let's say 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.870
 without any kind of non-existent 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 to Spain it's worth 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.930
 from the country 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.730
 here and for example we are going to buy 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.730
 and the athletic one of madrid 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.440
 4 gives the same meaning madrid 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 or one that already exists 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.110
 and here you have to put the players 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.930
 deductions this is nothing of the defects 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 that has the web for example we can 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.770
 put diego costa that we can 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 move we can put it where we want to 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.430
 Players 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.760
 we can put 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.130
 the family too 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.140
 then what we were putting 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.710
 here we have to choose the training 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.920
 we can change the for 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.869
 modify the players but it is for what 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 this stops when the player decides 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.430
 to have in each book 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.180
 and here you can put a description 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.730
 to save here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.500
 and well the clear shell we have to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.130
 take a whole team let's say because 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.130
 everyone 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.380
 although this 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:27.380
 let's move on to the next one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.380
 is at goal.com an annex let's say for 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.260
 here we give you here and we choose training 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.210
 here 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.180
 there is a little weird information and only 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.180
 there are these, for example, 433 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.910
 the barça as you see here I've been with 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 more lateral particular computer brand you from 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420
 team is 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.590
 For example, we are going to take the barça and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.920
 basically we have to look for players 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.320
 new put defensive goalies by 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.790
 exposure and the only bad thing is that they have 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.740
 to be in the database of equal 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.280
 that when they are practically the 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.400
 most players in the world there is 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.420
 of very rare leagues and that for example today 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.850
 let's look for techno teles the goalie 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.090
 of the barça 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.420
 this one will be 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 we put it here and well let's go and then 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.720
 we are putting it for example messi 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.770
 we give you to look here we have it 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.100
 and well I do not know if there will be players in plan 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.100
 legend we can put for example fight 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.830
 oh no it's not a fake p we say good 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.310
 the case this is pretty well the only 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.010
 is that you also have to bother and 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.750
 look for it and that and now let's go with the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.160
 what I like the most 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.070
 what is this here is called 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.690
 dot alignments is as easy as that 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.569
 I already tell you that you are going to have 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.159
 musical description 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.159
 Dove 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.640
 This is the one I like the most 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 here you can say it was a training 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.020
 there are plenty 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.850
 and they are quite normal all and here 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.669
 we can also drag players and 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.919
 can where we want here we will choose the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.550
 color what for those who at the moment there 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.550
 few do not 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.520
 for example to put the shirt of the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.370
 athletic of madrid for being me 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.690
 and a red or white shirt and a 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.690
 blue pants for example 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.090
 and it is already 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.090
 and for example the goalie would be 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 asenjo 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.210
 we would be here or not because here already 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.970
 we'll see if it goes or not, then what 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.860
 we are changing we can move it we can 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.740
 change position players 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.130
 we can put them later more than 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.920
 way more defensive midfielder to the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.900
 training we can even change it 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.860
 put the players these to the most 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.680
 band ticket office a thing like that is worth as 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.600
 we want and well it is very well what 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.340
 only one is that there are few colors still 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.260
 for example there are no colors like 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.900
 orange that would be to select the 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.880
 company 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.400
 alone and another thing is that you can only 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.110
 choose a color for shirt for 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.270
 pants some equipment carry more than 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.789
 a color when very much how could 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.979
 be the barça for example or it could be 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.690
 type of madrid if they carry two colors 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.840
 well you can do this can be like this 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.280
 like for example the barça or this pole 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.979
 that does not matter but the change for teams 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.979
 that have three colors like athletic 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.979
 well 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.590
 and let's share in this 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.270
 I like it because the format can not be 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.860
 choosing is the only one there is this then 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.310
 we could save this image to 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.340
 our computer can we can here 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.919
 Here is the link to the team 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.690
 the link to put it in a forum 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.930
 or to put it on our page 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.050
 web and it's very good this website is the one 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.350
 I like it, it's also good and it's going 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.699
 for tastes the two are all good but 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.729
 What I like the most is this 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.949
 customizable 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.749
 and nothing I hope you liked already
