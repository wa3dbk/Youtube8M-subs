series of alone boxing's now some of you

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.060 
series of alone boxing's now some of you
may<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.319> caught<00:00:07.529> our<00:00:07.740> last<00:00:07.980> unboxing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.350 

of<00:00:11.870> microsoft's<00:00:12.870> kinect<00:00:13.049> sensor<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.910> i<00:00:15.150> think

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
of microsoft's kinect sensor and i think

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.179 
of microsoft's kinect sensor and i think
it's<00:00:15.480> fair<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> say<00:00:15.840> that<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.379> caused<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.980> little

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
it's fair to say that it caused a little

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's fair to say that it caused a little
bit<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.670> debate<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.390> our<00:00:18.599> youtube<00:00:19.020> channel<00:00:19.050> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
bit of debate on our youtube channel so

if i can answer some of your questions
the<00:00:24.990> easiest<00:00:25.289> question<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.890> me<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.039> answer

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the easiest question for me to answer

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
the easiest question for me to answer
either<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.789> boxes<00:00:27.179> yes<00:00:27.720> by<00:00:28.080> work<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.679> game

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
either the boxes yes by work for game

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
either the boxes yes by work for game
not<00:00:29.580> Microsoft<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:32.580> what<00:00:33.449> all<00:00:33.629> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
not Microsoft I think what all the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.590 
not Microsoft I think what all the
questions<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.199> you<00:00:34.379> ask<00:00:34.530> me<00:00:35.180> one<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
questions that you ask me one of the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.160 
questions that you ask me one of the
most<00:00:37.110> prevalent<00:00:37.500> questions<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:39.019> problem<00:00:40.019> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
most prevalent questions was problem is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.910 
most prevalent questions was problem is
more<00:00:40.470> common<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.910> big<00:00:42.239> well<00:00:43.019> yes

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
more common actually it's big well yes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580 
more common actually it's big well yes
it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:45.239> big<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it is it's pretty big because it has a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
it is it's pretty big because it has a
huge<00:00:47.160> amount<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.489> technology<00:00:47.969> inside<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
huge amount of technology inside so

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
huge amount of technology inside so
unlike<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:49.800> sensor<00:00:50.730> bar<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
unlike some of the other sensor bar that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.520 
unlike some of the other sensor bar that
you<00:00:51.180> may<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:51.930> consoles<00:00:52.410> at

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you may have on your other consoles at

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
you may have on your other consoles at
home<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.489> impacts<00:00:54.030> quite<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
home and this impacts quite a lot of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
home and this impacts quite a lot of
technology<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.280> mentioned<00:00:56.609> last<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
technology as I mentioned last time it's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.740 
technology as I mentioned last time it's
got<00:00:57.359> an<00:00:57.510> RGB<00:00:57.870> camera<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.829> has<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.760> depth

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
got an RGB camera it has these two depth

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.130 
got an RGB camera it has these two depth
perception<00:01:01.649> lenses<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.940> also<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> multi

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
perception lenses it also has the multi

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
perception lenses it also has the multi
or<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.379> microphone<00:01:04.949> running<00:01:05.309> along<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.550> bottom

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
or a microphone running along the bottom

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
or a microphone running along the bottom
but<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.630> board<00:01:06.899> it<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> cpu<00:01:08.100> which

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
but on board it also has a cpu which

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
but on board it also has a cpu which
tries<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> couple<00:01:09.179> together<00:01:09.300> all<00:01:09.690> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
tries to couple together all this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.550 
tries to couple together all this
information<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.399> clever<00:01:11.789> stuff<00:01:12.149> like

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
information to do clever stuff like

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
information to do clever stuff like
filtering<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.830> voice<00:01:14.160> from<00:01:14.520> the

filtering up your voice from the
background<00:01:15.150> knowledge<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.600> maybe<00:01:15.810> the

background knowledge that maybe the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
background knowledge that maybe the
movie<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.560> watching<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.950> whatever<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
movie you're watching or whatever so it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.350 
movie you're watching or whatever so it
is<00:01:18.299> quite<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> substantial<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.670> sits<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
is quite a substantial it also sits on a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
is quite a substantial it also sits on a
motorized<00:01:21.990> base<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.130> base<00:01:24.020> labels<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
motorized base now this base labels the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.940 
motorized base now this base labels the
sense<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> tip<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:27.180> tilt<00:01:27.619> 27<00:01:28.619> degrees

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
sense about the tip or tilt 27 degrees

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030 
sense about the tip or tilt 27 degrees
from<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> truth<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> important

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
from the truth so why is that important

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
from the truth so why is that important
well<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> you're<00:01:32.670> playing<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> game<00:01:33.450> with

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
well if you're playing a game with

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
well if you're playing a game with
somebody<00:01:34.170> shorter<00:01:34.650> than<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.340> will

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
somebody shorter than you it will

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
somebody shorter than you it will
compensate<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.960> were<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> duck

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
compensate for that if you were to duck

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
compensate for that if you were to duck
out<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.729> sudden<00:01:39.150> sit<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.509> on

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
out or if you all sudden sit down on

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
out or if you all sudden sit down on
your<00:01:39.720> sofa<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.590> sensor<00:01:40.950> bar<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.340> continue<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
your sofa the sensor bar can continue to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.469 
your sofa the sensor bar can continue to
track<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.560> quite<00:01:43.880> substantial<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
track you so it is quite substantial I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.249 
track you so it is quite substantial I
think<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> word<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.259> choose<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:48.140> some<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
think is a word i choose to use some of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
think is a word i choose to use some of
you<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.530> said<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.880> easy<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you have said well one easy then that I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
you have said well one easy then that I

I need a room the size of the castle to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
I need a room the size of the castle to

UK<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.560> think<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.550> need<00:02:12.700> three<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.210> four<00:02:13.540> for

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
UK I think you need three or four for

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.360 
UK I think you need three or four for
either<00:02:13.870> side<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.650> well<00:02:14.800> whilst<00:02:15.190> your

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
either side of you as well whilst your

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.220 
either side of you as well whilst your
plank<00:02:15.580> because<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.450> will<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.720> moving<00:02:16.840> from

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
plank because you will be moving from

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.750 
plank because you will be moving from
side<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.560> side<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.950> backwards<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.430> forwards

side to side and backwards and forwards

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.340 
side to side and backwards and forwards
so<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.270> need<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> room<00:02:19.780> where<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:19.990> can<00:02:20.110> be

so you need a room where you can be

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.230 
so you need a room where you can be
about<00:02:20.650> six<00:02:20.950> foot<00:02:21.100> away<00:02:21.250> from<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.640> TV<00:02:21.820> so
