00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 that can be justified by the wording in 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.280
 improvement and organization 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.290
 government activities 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.619
 who understood raise your hands forest hand answer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.720
 almost all of this is the main message 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.240
 bill to abolish gubernatorial 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.369
 The election that was outside my walls yesterday 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 countrymen expensive from the legislative 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 meetings of the Khanty-Mansiysk district 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 same by analogy took yesterday 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 him and the German deputies and deputies 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.219
 German 2 laps have a lot 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 imbued with this promise thesis 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.950
 re-reading about several times and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.510
 vote for 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 but how can you call it a goal 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 perfecting excellence this 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.219
 process and all who worked the system 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.590
 quality management knows yes that's good 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.620
 but nothing more can not be called it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.260
 the goal it can not be such here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.260
 if you put for example the goal to lose weight on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.680
 300 grams to the new year yes it will be 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.960
 clear target 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 inspiring for its grandeur but 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 the question arises 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.320
 why do we do that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 the way we achieve excellence 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 legislation is not clear to me 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 the arguments are completely incomprehensible 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 the initiators of this bill this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.460
 I quote the idea in the present difficult 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.689
 socio-economic and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.880
 foreign policy situation is important 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.369
 let stability and when that she 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 there was no need here one author says that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 it is necessary on this basis 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.040
 do well you know 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.420
 The argument on dvoechku at all of course can be 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.140
 say that this initiative is similar to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 a walk on the fragile November ice 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.149
 and not even with a walk but with a trip 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 on the bulldozer and i will explain this why 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.040
 Began to refer to the first fashion link 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 always on international sanctions yes there is 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.939
 really significant difficulties on 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 international arena but we have today 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.189
 began to write off all oysters on them 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.710
 the store no trash brought out a light bulb 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.209
 the entrance hall is lit western sanctions it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.390
 very comfortable position for organs 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.620
 executive and government yes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.030
 i'm here 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.129
 I can say that is really not easy 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.530
 such conditions work but it is not 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.110
 is an exhaustive basis for 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.790
 write off everything and everyone on these international 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.069
 sanctions but who did not explain how 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.489
 international sanctions can 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.730
 affect the choice of a resident of Yamalo-Nenets 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.709
 Khanty-Mansiysk district 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.989
 Does anyone really believe that a spy 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.269
 imperialist intelligence will come to 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.940
 Khanty-Mansiysk and winning the election 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.250
 governor will be able to pump out all the oil 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.950
 take with you to the west but the floor is absurd 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 This is complete nonsense but they can not say 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 we chose the governor in September 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.540
 Tyumen region 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.299
 the elections were perfect 86 86 percent 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.909
 scored vladimir yakushev excellent well done 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.420
 check in his place works dmitry 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.549
 kobylkin 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.769
 governors little nenets district but it 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.230
 generally the first to take numbers of all ratings 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.690
 governors efficiency governor 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.840
 98 percent estimated but never 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.430
 falls in their ratings under 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 stability can be understood all that 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.049
 anything though soup 3 times a day 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.299
 well-known institutions but absolutely 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.970
 does not mean that if it is reached there 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.099
 It is worth it tomorrow to introduce elections and in 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.109
 prisons clean chief means 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.349
 Colony popular vote is 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.419
 the paradox of this can be no reference to 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.190
 All those theses that cited as cut 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.519
 stability well first 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.489
 instability stagnation in the country country 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.090
 need instability in the economy need 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.150
 powerful development spurt now say that 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.940
 can be cured being in a pitiable 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.629
 state of the economy only stability 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.629
 this is an illusion this is a pursuit of the horizon and 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.720
 I now have a question when we 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.430
 start to appreciate what we have here when 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.310
 stop doing permanent 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.199
 reforming when we will be you 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.370
 perceive the operating system as 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:16.260
 working and how effective there is 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.539
 Peopleâ€™s saying is not that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.699
 works and this is a big mistake with 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.719
 bays-floundering for 11 days without any 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.550
 discussions 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.190
 without consultation I was no longer 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.040
 referendum take and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.970
 legislature to take 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.280
 the bill that gives me the whole system with 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.000
 upside down is completely incomprehensible to me 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.760
 let's talk about referendums 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.970
 a great example just recently 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.960
 12 years ago in my city Surgut 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.840
 my beloved homeland 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.900
 held a referendum of the organization 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.640
 trolleybus traffic in the city announced 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.950
 people want trolley buses and style not 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.960
 want and people came and said their 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.790
 solid no we don't want to vote 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.050
 vs 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.390
 comrades also not the worst practice 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.000
 let's ask what our citizens want 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.180
 they want voters they don't want why we 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.800
 decide for them, there are other examples here 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.710
 we are all familiar 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.310
 Elena Baturina wanted to buy for 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.050
 10 million euro house in austria and nothing 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.480
 local residents held a referendum and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.120
 refused and this right but they do not 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.950
 She wanted them not convinced but it 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.570
 normal practice perfection whether the call 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.610
 ny approach when my citizens 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.640
 We ask and do not in accordance with 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.210
 this or not and it turns out paradoxical 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.820
 thing we give residents right 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.419
 Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.240
 German county to produce oil gas 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.160
 produce electricity waste your 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.380
 health 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.760
 transport gas needed 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.770
 state tasks to solve how on 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.540
 territory so thanks to those 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.850
 earned money you need on 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.500
 all important state tasks about 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.169
 which previous said today 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.570
 speakers we give them the right to earn 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.520
 but we do not give the right to take away their right 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.700
 choose your leader this 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.770
 totally unfair here this Yugra 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.850
 territory is not a territory with a complex 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.100
 criminal terrorist 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.390
 setting where regimes are constantly being introduced 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.260
 Kota is a region quite stable and 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.030
 to use this argument 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.570
 for some reverend reasons you need this 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.480
 justify we respect 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.120
 our southern republics but realizing that 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.970
 tensions we realize that 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.550
 maybe you should postpone the election 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.610
 have not yet achieved complete peace 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.640
 calm in these areas but there are 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.830
 another example 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.920
 leadership rising from the ruins 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.420
 practically Chechen Republic 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.820
 expressed full readiness and desire 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:53.380
 conduct direct leadership elections 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.780
 republic by popular vote and we 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.400
 region of free Siberian workers 40 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.760
 years of earning no earning money 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.760
 for a country in that right 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.330
 denies its citizens turns 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.630
 that we are not responsible people and 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.390
 we are not able to choose a governor this 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:17.110
 a huge misconception to treat us 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.000
 to voters as illiterate natives with 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.980
 incontestable evidence I can say 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.180
 what exactly are direct national elections 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.760
 governors are thin strings 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.480
 bind all residents together 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.520
 the territories of the population in Russia to find 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.340
 currently consolidated as 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.370
 never and everyone wants 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.320
 stability prosperity of our country but 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.530
 the question arises why the initiator here 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.290
 this scribbling drive a wedge between power 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.760
 and society 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.669
 do we really want it 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.280
 demonstrate to the world that we are not 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:58.980
 confident in their nation sure 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.080
 that there is no law for the natives 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.160
 faction right russia 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.550
 categorical vote will be against 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.550
 of this law
