00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 I welcome all viewers of my channel 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.510
 today we will do such a natural 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 cough medicine for colds and for 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.360
 raising immunity as you understood for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 of this we will use the bumps 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.230
 pine young i'm wearing gloves for that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.869
 the reason that they are pricked and give off very 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 a lot of tar which is then very hard 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:35.940
 washed off with hands and our potions will be 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.910
 be called pine honey for him we 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.030
 take the bumps as I already told us 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 need sugar 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 do honey based need in a few 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 stages the first stage we have to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.539
 it is natural to collect the bumps and well 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 thoroughly wash them with the second stage we 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 we drop our bumps in some dishes and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.129
 pour water on your finger above the surface 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.680
 our cones that is a centimeter 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:15.420
 two higher than the bumps themselves 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 the bumps we put on fire bring to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.869
 boil and boil the needle thirty-forty 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.909
 after which we take off sleep and our bumps and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.720
 let it brew for 6 7 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:38.520
 after that we take out the bumps ourselves from us 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.939
 liquid remains and then into this liquid 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.619
 we add sugar based on their appearance 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.229
 liquid that is flown around a decoction of cones 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 kilogram of sugar now I'm 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.780
 directly go to the stove 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.640
 one of my bumps will go to the plate 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 and show you these steps clearly and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.980
 see what we get here is about 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.430
 so this is all in 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.540
 these flood them already some water as you understood 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:15.820
 Now I will put on gas x I want more 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.770
 note that the bumps are better to collect in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.860
 late May early June 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.840
 when they are full of mines from those substances 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.320
 which in principle are therapeutic 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 go to the stove and as I have already noted 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.110
 we will now our bumps should 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.740
 boil and simmer we all 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.580
 Tomim get forty minutes then 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.690
 turn off the gas and leave them 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.250
 push for 6 hours 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.210
 Naturally capacity in which you will 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.630
 she must boil her stump 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.730
 should have a cap because these are bumps 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 tune under the lid closed and so 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.960
 my bumps stood here see here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:14.010
 such a result is such a shade 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.010
 decoction and now we need to decant 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.260
 now per liter 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.380
 our broth and add 1 kilogram 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:33.160
 sugar that is one to one 1 liter 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:38.440
 decoction of one kilogram of sugar naturally 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.610
 sugar as if it is not particularly useful but in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.390
 In this case, it will be with us 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.400
 preservative clear honey 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.790
 do not preserve this decoction 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.560
 because now we move merge to 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.790
 cooker and we will cook 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.400
 this syrup boil it roughly 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.250
 a half to two hours here we are and honey as you 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.930
 see it boils he changed color to that 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.850
 amber yellow 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.410
 therefrom with both conventional boil 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:19.100
 you should not remove this stump 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.610
 so that the honey was transparent and so we 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.810
 pine honey is ready in half an hour 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.560
 he rolled up in a jar as you see it 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.560
 so beautiful 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.470
 peach amber shade it 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.410
 cough aid 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.510
 strengthens the immune system and very long 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.510
 stored even at room temperature 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 take his trail to strengthen 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.130
 immunity one tablespoon 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.550
 dissolved in water 1 day and cough up to 7 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:06.550
 once a day a tablespoon of sucking 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.730
 that is, not immediately swallowing but a little bit 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.140
 savoring 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.870
 I would say so the power of all everything 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:20.110
