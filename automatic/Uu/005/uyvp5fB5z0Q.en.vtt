three<00:00:10.600> years<00:00:10.629> in<00:00:11.170> all<00:00:12.129> answer<00:00:12.490> you<00:00:12.580> could

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
three years in all answer you could

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.129 
three years in all answer you could
probably<00:00:12.880> can<00:00:13.090> use<00:00:13.269> it<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:13.480> little<00:00:13.570> bit<00:00:13.809> earlier

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
probably can use it a little bit earlier

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.450 
probably can use it a little bit earlier
because<00:00:14.290> you<00:00:14.500> have<00:00:14.710> got<00:00:14.950> this<00:00:15.040> reclined

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
because you have got this reclined

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460 
because you have got this reclined
position<00:00:15.580> on<00:00:16.000> here<00:00:16.299> so<00:00:16.720> that<00:00:16.840> will<00:00:17.050> take<00:00:17.290> the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
position on here so that will take the

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.990 
position on here so that will take the
weight<00:00:17.740> off<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:18.099> back<00:00:18.250> of<00:00:18.279> the<00:00:18.490> head<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:18.790> neck

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
weight off the back of the head and neck

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.609 
weight off the back of the head and neck
and<00:00:19.270> will<00:00:19.540> allow<00:00:19.810> them<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.110> go<00:00:20.200> in<00:00:20.320> there<00:00:20.470> just

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
and will allow them to go in there just

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.490 
and will allow them to go in there just
that<00:00:20.830> little<00:00:20.920> bit<00:00:21.070> earlier<00:00:21.160> so<00:00:22.500> talking

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
that little bit earlier so talking

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.900

other<00:00:48.850> safety<00:00:49.330> feature<00:00:49.720> with<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.199> is<00:00:50.409> an

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
other safety feature with this is an

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.109 
other safety feature with this is an
extra<00:00:51.010> safety<00:00:51.250> feature<00:00:51.640> which<00:00:51.850> is<00:00:51.970> actually

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:52.119 
extra safety feature which is actually

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.899 
extra safety feature which is actually
attached<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.900> tray<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:53.830> once<00:00:54.369> that's<00:00:54.640> on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
attached to the tray and once that's on

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.060 
attached to the tray and once that's on
if<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.809> did<00:00:56.019> manage<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.379> wriggle<00:00:56.650> out<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.769> that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
if we did manage to wriggle out of that

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.829 
if we did manage to wriggle out of that
you<00:00:57.220> can't<00:00:57.549> get<00:00:57.729> past<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.269> part<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.750> your

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
you can't get past that part of your

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.939 
you can't get past that part of your
tray<00:01:01.199> talking<00:01:02.199> through<00:01:02.439> then<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.830> actual

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
tray talking through then the actual

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.850 
tray talking through then the actual
seat<00:01:03.339> unit<00:01:03.489> itself<00:01:04.000> between<00:01:04.720> seat<00:01:05.260> pad<00:01:05.530> and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
seat unit itself between seat pad and

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
seat unit itself between seat pad and
that<00:01:06.189> just<00:01:06.400> comes<00:01:06.580> off<00:01:06.729> quite<00:01:07.030> easily<00:01:07.060> like<00:01:07.689> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that just comes off quite easily like so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.260 
that just comes off quite easily like so
normally<00:01:09.040> it's<00:01:09.130> about<00:01:09.310> 12<00:01:09.640> months<00:01:10.000> something

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
normally it's about 12 months something

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.940 
normally it's about 12 months something
like<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.140> then<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.590> will<00:01:11.710> give<00:01:11.830> you

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
like that and then that will give you

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.510 
like that and then that will give you
more<00:01:12.130> room<00:01:12.400> for<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.670> child<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.060> go<00:01:13.180> into

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
more room for the child to go into

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.130 
more room for the child to go into
adjustable<00:01:15.520> arm<00:01:15.700> rest<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.330> that<00:01:16.600> will<00:01:16.690> go<00:01:16.840> up

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
adjustable arm rest and that will go up

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.810 
adjustable arm rest and that will go up
or<00:01:17.440> down<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.010> do<00:01:18.160> want<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.430> have<00:01:18.550> them<00:01:18.730> as<00:01:18.790> a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
or down if you do want to have them as a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.220 
or down if you do want to have them as a
table<00:01:19.270> without<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.630> tray<00:01:21.360> three<00:01:22.360> positions<00:01:22.930> on

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
table without a tray three positions on

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.710 
table without a tray three positions on
your<00:01:23.590> actual<00:01:23.800> foot<00:01:24.250> rest<00:01:24.520> here<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.120> your<00:01:25.510> foot

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
your actual foot rest here and your foot

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.110 
your actual foot rest here and your foot
rest<00:01:25.960> will<00:01:26.230> go<00:01:26.260> up<00:01:26.620> or<00:01:26.890> down<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.370> well<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:27.970> in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
rest will go up or down as well so in

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.880 
rest will go up or down as well so in
theory<00:01:28.390> if<00:01:28.660> they're<00:01:28.810> really<00:01:29.170> small<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.770> can

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
theory if they're really small you can

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.830 
theory if they're really small you can
have<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.190> higher<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.850> then<00:01:31.540> you've<00:01:31.690> got

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
have that higher and then you've got

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.870 
have that higher and then you've got
this<00:01:31.960> adjustment<00:01:32.500> on<00:01:32.680> here<00:01:33.070> for<00:01:33.550> when<00:01:33.700> they

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
this adjustment on here for when they

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.500 
this adjustment on here for when they
are<00:01:34.060> older<00:01:35.640> height<00:01:36.640> adjustments<00:01:37.270> you've<00:01:37.390> got

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
are older height adjustments you've got

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.180 
are older height adjustments you've got
six<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.080> again<00:01:38.380> it's<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.860> orange

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
six and again it's just this orange

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.460 
six and again it's just this orange
button<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.670> front<00:01:39.820> here<00:01:40.110> glass<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.140> your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
button on the front here glass is your

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.649 
button on the front here glass is your
lowest<00:01:41.920> position<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.760> you've<00:01:43.120> got<00:01:43.240> various
