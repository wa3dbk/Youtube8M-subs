AM radio with what I refer to as the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.150 
AM radio with what I refer to as the
afterthought<00:01:33.450> air-conditioning<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:36.040> of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
afterthought air-conditioning kind of

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.940 
afterthought air-conditioning kind of
wild<00:01:36.460> how<00:01:36.580> they<00:01:36.700> put<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.000> there<00:01:37.710> let's<00:01:38.710> take<00:01:38.920> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
wild how they put it there let's take a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:53.100 
wild how they put it there let's take a
spin<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:41.560> out<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.770> my<00:01:41.890> grass<00:01:42.130> first

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.010 

gauges<00:01:53.830> are<00:01:53.980> all<00:01:54.010> functional

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.899 

I<00:02:00.140> didn't<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> description<00:02:01.909> earlier

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
I didn't put in the description earlier

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
I didn't put in the description earlier
but<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> does<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.750> some<00:02:04.560> play<00:02:04.859> in<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
but it does have some play in the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.719 
but it does have some play in the
steering<00:02:05.549> wheel<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.280> need<00:02:08.280> an

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
steering wheel and it will need an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.740 
steering wheel and it will need an
alignment

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
alignment

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.810 
alignment
we're<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.620> kind<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.070> open<00:02:12.280> alignments

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
we're not kind of open alignments

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.270 
we're not kind of open alignments
necessary<00:02:13.300> as<00:02:13.480> much<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> wheel<00:02:14.650> balance<00:02:15.100> or

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
necessary as much as a wheel balance or

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.910 
necessary as much as a wheel balance or
something<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.350> possible<00:02:19.920> let's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
something like that so possible let's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.670 
something like that so possible let's
get<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.790> then

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
get it out here and then

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.330 
get it out here and then
open-road<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> sec

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
runs well transmissions in great shape

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:45.620 
runs well transmissions in great shape
doesn't<00:02:36.579> miss<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:36.909> beat

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.590 

I'll<00:02:46.040> stop<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.400> start<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.120> get<00:02:48.420> some

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I'll stop it and start it and get some

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.420 
I'll stop it and start it and get some
speed<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.560> second<00:02:49.950> by<00:02:50.370> the
