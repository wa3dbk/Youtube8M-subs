well<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.810> feels<00:02:42.019> exactly<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.709> same<00:02:42.829> as<00:02:43.130> this

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
well it feels exactly the same as this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.699 
well it feels exactly the same as this
one<00:02:43.750> what<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.840> good<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.380> actually

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
one what is good is this is actually

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.199 
one what is good is this is actually
waterproof<00:02:45.950> already<00:02:46.519> which<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.760> kind<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.090> nice

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
waterproof already which is kind of nice

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.400

because sometimes when you have to add
on<00:02:48.590> those<00:02:48.769> bulky<00:02:49.250> other<00:02:49.430> cases<00:02:49.790> onto<00:02:50.269> these<00:02:50.390> it

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
on those bulky other cases onto these it

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.180 
on those bulky other cases onto these it
can<00:02:51.110> get<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.290> little<00:02:51.500> frustrating<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.070> you're

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
you're going to be doing with it what's

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.300 
you're going to be doing with it what's
great<00:04:01.970> about<00:04:02.000> this<00:04:02.300> one<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.840> small

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
great about this one is it is small

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.370 
great about this one is it is small
clearly<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.880> pretty<00:04:05.209> tiny<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.110> don't

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
clearly it's pretty tiny and you don't

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.199 
clearly it's pretty tiny and you don't
need<00:04:06.560> an<00:04:06.709> external<00:04:07.040> case<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.060> it's

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
need an external case on it so it's

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.610 
need an external case on it so it's
already<00:04:08.510> waterproof<00:04:09.020> which<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.470> nice

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
already waterproof which is really nice

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.020 
already waterproof which is really nice
but<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.310> problem<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:12.370> $399<00:04:13.370> which<00:04:13.580> is

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
but the problem is it is $399 which is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.930 
but the problem is it is $399 which is
pretty<00:04:14.360> much<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.630> same<00:04:14.990> exact<00:04:15.380> price<00:04:15.620> as<00:04:15.940> one

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
pretty much the same exact price as one
