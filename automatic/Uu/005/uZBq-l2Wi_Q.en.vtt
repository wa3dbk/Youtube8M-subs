regarding<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.980> intestines<00:00:05.490> also<00:00:06.029> that

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
regarding the intestines also that

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.620 
regarding the intestines also that
something<00:00:08.069> will<00:00:08.250> we<00:00:08.639> never<00:00:08.880> did<00:00:09.120> before<00:00:09.300> is

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
something will we never did before is

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.499 
something will we never did before is
that<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.260> give<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.740> case<00:00:11.040> where<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.360> you

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
that to give the case where when you

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.810 
that to give the case where when you
take<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.900> elements<00:00:13.320> separately<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
take the elements separately so that the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.020 
take the elements separately so that the
back<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.560> personality

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
back the personality

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.790 
back the personality
you<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.630> paint<00:00:18.870> them<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.820> hard<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
you can paint them they are not hard and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.780 
you can paint them they are not hard and
it's<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.100> they're<00:00:23.310> thinner<00:00:23.580> because

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
it's because they're thinner because

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.120 
it's because they're thinner because
because<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.360> are<00:00:24.450> so<00:00:24.660> thin<00:00:24.960> soup<00:00:25.770> additional

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
because they are so thin soup additional

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.190 
because they are so thin soup additional
using<00:00:26.400> standard<00:00:26.730> metal<00:00:26.910> yeah<00:00:27.600> we<00:00:27.870> are<00:00:28.020> using

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
using standard metal yeah we are using

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.370 
using standard metal yeah we are using
the<00:00:28.440> platinum<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.610> fact<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.940> that<00:00:30.170> if<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the platinum the fact is that if you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.560 
the platinum the fact is that if you
take<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.620> the<00:00:31.980> back<00:00:32.210> if<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
take just the back if you are a lot of

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
take just the back if you are a lot of
interesting<00:00:36.570> once<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.410> assemble<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.130> watch

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
interesting once you assemble your watch

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.229 
interesting once you assemble your watch
it's<00:00:39.390> totally<00:00:39.960> resistant<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> still<00:00:41.220> so<00:00:42.030> for

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it's totally resistant and still so for

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660 
it's totally resistant and still so for
the<00:00:42.330> first<00:00:42.480> time<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.950> parts<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the first time this the parts of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
the first time this the parts of
severity<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:46.080> resistant<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.190> once<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
severity are not resistant but once it's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
severity are not resistant but once it's
finished<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.629> resistant<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.770> structurally

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
finished it's resistant so structurally

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
finished it's resistant so structurally
many<00:00:50.699> people<00:00:51.059> were<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.809> reconvened

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
many people were not that the reconvened

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.040 
many people were not that the reconvened
so<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.589> had<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> make<00:00:53.010> internally<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.730> test

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
so we had to make internally and test

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
so we had to make internally and test
testing<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> watch<00:00:55.680> by<00:00:55.949> placing<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> watch

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
testing the watch by placing the watch

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
testing the watch by placing the watch
on<00:00:57.330> that<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> cylinder<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.769> hanging<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
on that kind of cylinder and hanging it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.140 
on that kind of cylinder and hanging it
weighs<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> sides<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.199> must<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.589> a

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
weighs on the sides that must have a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.090 
weighs on the sides that must have a
default<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.540> ended<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.350> measure<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.860> case

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
default and ended we measure the case

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670 
default and ended we measure the case
and<00:01:05.400> son<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> same<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.930> osseo<00:01:07.409> test

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and son into the same with at osseo test

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.600 
and son into the same with at osseo test
which<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.820> gather<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> everyone<00:01:10.860> was

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
which we gather so that everyone was

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
which we gather so that everyone was
could<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.390> freak<00:01:12.690> invincible<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
could be freak invincible that's good a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
could be freak invincible that's good a
general<00:01:14.850> could<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.120> good<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.840> also

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
general could be good people are also

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
general could be good people are also
they<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.000> believe<00:01:18.890> did<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
they just don't believe did they see and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
they just don't believe did they see and
so<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.760> so<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.180> wanted<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:21.990> proof

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
so on so they wanted to have the proof

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.830 
so on so they wanted to have the proof
so<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> pushes<00:01:23.159> us<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> remove<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.810> need

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so it pushes us to remove it and we need

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.020 
so it pushes us to remove it and we need
to<00:01:25.170> test

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
to test

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.080 
to test
and<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.720> makes<00:01:27.640> something<00:01:28.640> which<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.060> not

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
and that makes something which is not

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.560 
and that makes something which is not
good<00:01:29.270> will<00:01:30.229> detect<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:31.400> for<00:01:34.210> they<00:01:35.210> used<00:01:35.390> to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
good will detect it but for they used to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.330 
good will detect it but for they used to
we<00:01:35.990> oughta<00:01:36.140> turn<00:01:36.350> watch<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.770> portage<00:01:37.100> to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
we oughta turn watch the portage to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.560 
we oughta turn watch the portage to
actually<00:01:37.640> try<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.000> bend<00:01:38.180> them<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.330> see<00:01:38.540> if

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
actually try and bend them to see if

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.060 
actually try and bend them to see if
they<00:01:38.690> would<00:01:38.810> stop<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> movement<00:01:39.380> absolutely

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
they would stop the movement absolutely

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.760 
they would stop the movement absolutely
a<00:01:40.100> lot<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.400> times<00:01:40.610> will<00:01:40.820> stop<00:01:41.030> them<00:01:41.770> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
a lot of the times will stop them and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.590 
a lot of the times will stop them and
because<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.310> people<00:01:43.820> they've<00:01:44.240> been<00:01:44.420> there

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
because of people they've been there

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.469 
because of people they've been there
around<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.350> 20<00:01:46.310> t<00:01:47.590> know<00:01:48.590> again<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.970> they<00:01:50.210> want

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
around for 20 t know again so they want

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
around for 20 t know again so they want
us<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.930> really<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.320> check<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.799> that's<00:01:51.979> why<00:01:52.130> we

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
us to really to check and that's why we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.370

are<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.610> demonstrate<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.720> measure<00:01:53.930> and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
are to demonstrate and to measure and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.560 
are to demonstrate and to measure and
