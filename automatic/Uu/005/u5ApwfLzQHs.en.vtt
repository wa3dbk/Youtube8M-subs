that cohesion to upset that consistency
would<00:01:31.240> be<00:01:31.390> wrong<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.740> trick<00:01:33.130> for<00:01:33.160> us<00:01:33.490> was

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
would be wrong so the trick for us was

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.600 
would be wrong so the trick for us was
to<00:01:33.759> find<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.300> contemporary<00:01:35.050> expression<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
to find a contemporary expression of the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.090 
to find a contemporary expression of the
historical<00:01:37.240> principles<00:01:37.900> of<00:01:38.259> st.<00:01:38.619> Petersburg

historical principles of st. Petersburg

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.010 
historical principles of st. Petersburg
so<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.610> DNA<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.030> therefore<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> good<00:01:40.780> opera

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
so the DNA is therefore a good opera

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.810 
so the DNA is therefore a good opera
house<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.190> have<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.429> do<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.759> a
