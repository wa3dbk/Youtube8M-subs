 so quick I leave you with the step to 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.380
 He passed 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.380
 bye 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 forms and types of eyebrows 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.120
 the eyebrows are the framework of our look 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.930
 and panama the form can make us see 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.300
 bad 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.730
 sad younger or even older 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 that's why it's important to find our 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 ideal way 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.759
 we started 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.700
 harmony with our face with a pencil 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.860
 white and with the help of a comb he cited 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.479
 of those for eyebrows let's take our 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.970
 mirror and we will face it 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.920
 we will create an imaginary line that you pass 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.710
 from the letter of the nose make tears 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.960
 we mark with the white pencil and that will be 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 the point where our faith will begin now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.729
 we will make another line that touches the fin of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.130
 the nose and go through the middle of the go 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.259
 and that will be the point where our eyebrows 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.329
 have their highest point we will make 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.580
 new from the fin of the nose towards 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.430
 the end of the eye that will be the point 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.080
 where our being will end 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.080
 now let's do tests 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.570
 with our eyeliner we are going to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.320
 experience the value and form of 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.320
 our mushrooms 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.230
 see how I see myself with the most 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.160
 thin 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.160
 and the truth 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.110
 let's do it 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
 we will need a pair of tweezers 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.269
 now we will start to remove the hairs 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.180
 remaining that are outside the line 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.040
 white we made it is important to polish 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.600
 a little bit also the top of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.000
 our eyebrows but not much 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.470
 can do a new way or follow the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.470
 natural way as there is sir 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.580
 something very important is that the eyebrows are 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.230
 sisters but they are not twins this wants 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.240
 to say that you are not always left 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.980
 same always have a different to the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.980
 another so do not worry about that 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.320
 let's clean the white pencil with 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.320
 cotonete 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.540
 now to cut the heras 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.760
 We're going to need a little scissors and a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.040
 brush we comb the hair of our 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.319
 eyebrows up and the surplus what 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.660
 short this we do it so that the eyebrows 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.580
 they look much more arranged but if you 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.580
 you do not have many skip this step 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.110
 now we make up our eyebrows 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.560
 for this we can use shadows 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.280
 or pen 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.180
 it is important to know that you have to 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.000
 Make up your eyebrows according to the tone 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.949
 of your hair but never but never 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.990
 never never make up your eyebrows 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.910
 black so you have super black hair 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.160
 It is preferable that you use a brown 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.250
 dark since the black will harden 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.870
 your features and that does not look nice with 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.090
 the pencil we will start to give small 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.160
 arms up to fill our do the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.560
 pencil will give us a stronger effect or 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.960
 more marked now with brush let's 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.849
 blur the pencil emphasizing the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.280
 beginning of the eyebrows so that it 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.100
 see a little more natural 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.160
 now with shadows we are going to use a 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.540
 pixelated brush and we're going to start 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.540
 fill all the eyebrows 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.000
 with the same brush we blend to 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.160
 make it look more natural with the shadows 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.129
 we will get a lot more effect 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.189
 natural that with the pencil 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.189
 for defined and perfect eyebrows 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.180
 let's outline the eyebrows with our 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.180
 pencil eyeliner 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.150
 fill with shadow 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.930
 and we blend with a brush 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.730
 and now we will take a corrector and 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.730
 we mark the edge of our eyebrow 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.480
 with a transparent mask we set 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.480
 our eyebrows 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.040
 and now we can show off some 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.040
 perfect in harmony with our face
