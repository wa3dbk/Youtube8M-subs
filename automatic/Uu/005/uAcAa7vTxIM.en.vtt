probably<00:05:02.900> our<00:05:03.080> our<00:05:04.090> strengths<00:05:05.090> for<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.390> lot<00:05:05.630> of

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
probably our our strengths for a lot of

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.600 
probably our our strengths for a lot of
years

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
years

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.189

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
good at something and just build on that

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.189 
good at something and just build on that
