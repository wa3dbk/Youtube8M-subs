options too many to be able to fit this
early<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.109> think<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:29.310> can't<00:03:29.609> tell<00:03:29.819> where

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
early I think you can't tell where

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.339 
early I think you can't tell where
they're<00:03:30.150> gonna<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:30.450> with<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.230> what

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
they're gonna go with it and that's what

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.599 
they're gonna go with it and that's what
I<00:03:31.440> love<00:03:31.470> about<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.099> because<00:03:32.310> there's<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.549> many

I love about it because there's so many

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.400 
I love about it because there's so many
places<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.060> want<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.200> don't

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
fast because if they move fast cuz they

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.979 
fast because if they move fast cuz they
want<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.819> gloss<00:03:42.209> over<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.630> lot<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
want to they can gloss over a lot of

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.199 
want to they can gloss over a lot of
stuff<00:03:43.200> they<00:03:43.410> might<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:44.160> jump<00:03:44.549> around<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
stuff they might just jump around and

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.470 
stuff they might just jump around and
lead<00:03:45.480> plot<00:03:45.840> holes<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> suspect<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:48.450> is
