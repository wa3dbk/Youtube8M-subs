three ounces the blade is made of a os8

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.330 
three ounces the blade is made of a os8
steel<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.539> handle<00:01:11.960> itself<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.680> if<00:01:13.190> you're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
steel and the handle itself is if you're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.760 
steel and the handle itself is if you're
familiar<00:01:13.460> with<00:01:13.759> sog<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.509> is<00:01:14.959> there's<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.440> tell

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
familiar with sog it is there's I tell

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.520 
familiar with sog it is there's I tell
style<00:01:16.280> handle<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:17.209> does<00:01:17.479> have<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> safety<00:01:18.080> on<00:01:18.380> it

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
style handle it does have a safety on it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.290 
style handle it does have a safety on it
so<00:01:18.679> it<00:01:18.770> locks<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.190> blade<00:01:19.399> into<00:01:19.729> place<00:01:20.000> when

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
so it locks the blade into place when

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.419 
so it locks the blade into place when
it's<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.569> its<00:01:20.720> open<00:01:21.020> position<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:22.009> can<00:01:22.250> pull

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's in its open position you can pull

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.550 
it's in its open position you can pull
it<00:01:22.550> down<00:01:22.700> by<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.000> little<00:01:23.420> lever<00:01:23.599> here<00:01:24.050> so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
it down by this little lever here so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.230 
it down by this little lever here so
we'll<00:01:24.709> just<00:01:24.740> pull<00:01:25.069> that<00:01:25.099> down<00:01:25.459> and<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.030> blade

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
we'll just pull that down and the blade

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.320 
we'll just pull that down and the blade
easily<00:01:26.750> closes<00:01:27.259> this<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.399> partially<00:01:28.940> it

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
easily closes this is the partially it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.969 
easily closes this is the partially it
just<00:01:29.630> kind<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.899> flops<00:01:30.170> around<00:01:30.319> afterwards

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
just kind of flops around afterwards

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.160 
just kind of flops around afterwards
