00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
just to make it look more vicious and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
you know give it a cooler factor because

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.690

a<00:03:12.760> little<00:03:12.910> bit<00:03:13.120> more<00:03:13.330> oomph<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.530> like

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680

cockpit<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.360> change<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.810> front<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.230> be

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
cockpit and change the front to be

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.980 
cockpit and change the front to be
actually<00:03:17.680> see-through<00:03:18.100> but<00:03:18.850> aside<00:03:19.810> from<00:03:19.870> that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
actually see-through but aside from that

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.180 
actually see-through but aside from that
I'm<00:03:20.230> actually<00:03:20.380> really<00:03:20.620> happy<00:03:20.980> with

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190

this<00:03:23.530> which<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.830> shouldn't<00:03:24.070> have<00:03:24.310> because

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
this which it shouldn't have because

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.970 
this which it shouldn't have because
it's<00:03:24.670> such<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.850> simple<00:03:25.480> model<00:03:25.870> kind<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.800> mad<00:03:26.950> at

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
