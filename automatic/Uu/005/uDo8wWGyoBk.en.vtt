00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.420
 promised before a video of tissues like 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 facebook but I had problems and I sent 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.849
 a club with my life was not fair 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849
 how do i believe 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.010
 but this will not upload to youtube 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 Well, I loved it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.890
 super cute super pretty and I love 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 and this is the mobile that we are going to make 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.489
 today we are going to need 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.430
 paper tubes and the waxed accounts 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 cardboard glue white scissors a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.079
 pencil chinche a lighter and brooches or 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 to grab clothes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.019
 and now let's see how it is done 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.210
 first we will save the cardboard tubes 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.610
 and we're going to crush it well 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 we will grab a rule and go to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.710
 make marks every 1.5 cm 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.710
 with a pencil or pen 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.720
 after finishing we will do the same in the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.720
 bottom part 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.780
 after finishing we will join all 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.780
 all those brands with a girl 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.290
 and then with the scissors we're going to start 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.290
 to cut everything 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.290
 and these would be the petals leaves or I do not know 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.290
 how to tell them 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.010
 and then I ended up cutting them out 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.660
 start putting together some flowers we are going to 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.280
 grab the tubes that we cut it 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.030
 would be the petals as we told you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 we are going to hit like this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.200
 so you can completely 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 do also with the silicone gun 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.830
 but I do not want to be the bars that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.990
 had then use the glue 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 White 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.090
 well if you can help if you want to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.390
 brooches like this to go grabbing the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.390
 petals 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.310
 after having those flowers of the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.650
 amount for those who want we are going to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 start to glue each other or to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.960
 sticking side by side in the river 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.850
 work and so 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.850
 and so we are going to love as 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.950
 like a vine something like that I do not know how 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.950
 explain them 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.940
 or what glue him well 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.940
 they are well stuck 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.150
 to go playing watching where one is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.240
 with another one I loved this is the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.180
 part more fun for my mind I 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.180
 has been entertained enough not leave me 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 A) Yes 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.950
 and so they will keep hitting until you have the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.950
 desired vine 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.220
 and so we will go running and then 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.870
 what they can do is grab the votes 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.569
 little tubes and they had left over biden 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.610
 enough we are going to hit the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.300
 above the flowers to be like 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.300
 the leaves 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.299
 and seeing where to put them in 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.290
 reality is all like saying it like a 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.709
 puzzle 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.569
 but I swear I had fun doing 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.290
 this and I hope that you too 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.290
 obviously 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.739
 well, everyone 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.530
 you guys want when they finish what 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.530
 they can paint is like that obviously 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.560
 after having so let's let it dry 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.050
 now let's cut out some hearts 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 let's hang in there a mobile self in 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.460
 this case of a stew salt hearts 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.260
 and we are going to paste the we are going to draw the 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.880
 sorry about a card they want 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.430
 use well in this case use a 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.810
 golden with the seen let's draw the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.610
 opposite of the size hearts 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.020
 I want more 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.020
 and we are going to cut it 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.470
 then we will make a bug or it will not be eaten 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.980
 you and we're going to make holes up and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.969
 down all the little hearts so that 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.849
 they remain like this 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:42.039
 Now that we will make the cord good if 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.529
 can use any one already use the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.979
 waxed thread let's make a knot in 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.979
 tip 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.389
 and then if I am very long lilita s 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.030
 let's cut it notice flush and I started 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.060
 the door let's burn the tip to 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.770
 that we do not disarm the knot and the same 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.270
 we will do the other side but instead of 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.979
 make the knot we're just going to burn 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.159
 and we are going to give a few laps with the 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.870
 finger so that we have a point of view and 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.460
 we can go through some accounts 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.199
 many and we carry two million ones 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.150
 pebbles little balls of colors I do not know there 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.090
 a lot of little things you like so 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.949
 playing go and come brando let's do 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.780
 let's leave a space more or less and 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:28.610
 let's make a knot like that 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.530
 and they can if they want to add more accounts 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.719
 and then we can go placing the 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.539
 hearts that we made let's save the 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:38.000
 heart let's pass the thread like this 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.240
 go back through the little hole in 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.240
 down 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.690
 if it's the end and then back to 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.050
 go through the little hole that we made 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.050
 above 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.740
 A) Yes 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.630
 say that give your little heart 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.840
 and we will continue to place chairs or armchairs 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.409
 so we'll keep knotting and 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.229
 until making several several pendants 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.339
 this is another part that I love very much 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.339
 Well, actually, I loved it 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.490
 and so will all of you, I made bars and 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.590
 then we're going to hang up that this would be 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.570
 the last thing we're going to see first where 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.950
 we want to place them with a girl and 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.980
 let's do the little hole 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.860
 well let's pass the thread by the 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.920
 hole so let's see the height more 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.810
 or less that is the length that the quantity 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.740
 that we want to leave hanging like this and we're going 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.740
 to make a knot 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.340
 A) Yes 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.680
 yes 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.030
 let's press hard we will tell you what 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.130
 that we have left of thread 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.590
 and then so that we do not disarm knots 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.590
 let's burn it with a lighter 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.500
 and so they will have the finished work 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.500
 and well I hope that 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.449
 that you already know when you recycle those 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.449
 Cardboard tubes 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:31.340
 Now let's gather everything and Alvarez from 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.340
 beautiful so go to work small 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.740
 and also so you can follow me
