the butterfly s and the HTC one we just
wanted<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> test<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.780> difference<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.349> clock

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
wanted to test the difference in clock

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.009 
wanted to test the difference in clock
speeds<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> HTC<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.450> clocked<00:00:12.809> at

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
speeds because the HTC one is clocked at

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.250 
speeds because the HTC one is clocked at
1.7<00:00:13.920> Gigot<00:00:14.219> snapdragon<00:00:14.940> 600<00:00:15.480> while<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
1.7 Gigot snapdragon 600 while the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.330 
1.7 Gigot snapdragon 600 while the
butterfly<00:00:16.650> s<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.130> clocked<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.789> 1.9<00:00:18.660> gigahertz

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
butterfly s is clocked at 1.9 gigahertz

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.310 
butterfly s is clocked at 1.9 gigahertz
snapdragon<00:00:20.340> 600<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.810> wanted<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> actually

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
snapdragon 600 so we wanted to actually

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
snapdragon 600 so we wanted to actually
test<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> real<00:00:23.490> world<00:00:23.880> performance

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
test out what the real world performance

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.700 
test out what the real world performance
the<00:00:24.990> princess<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:27.289> let's<00:00:28.289> start<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the princess would be so let's start the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
the princess would be so let's start the
browser<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.310> board<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> them<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:36.780> year<00:00:36.840> they

browser on board of them this year they
started<00:00:40.520> not<00:00:41.520> much<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> difference<00:00:42.270> there

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
started not much of a difference there
