00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.120
 that is, explained to efe 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.660
 the phrase

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.600
 Some say it is crime since the rain is just an element that makes 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.870
 part of the climate that they determine but explainable 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.160
 Cuba and China is the set of meteorological conditions that 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.109
 repeat in cycles of time in a region 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.109
 the conditions as weather elements 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.539
 that make up the climate are 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.719
 temperature 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.539
 the atmospheric pressure 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.479
 humidity 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.909
 the precipitations 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.749
 and the winds 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.889
 the temperature is the highest with the least amount of heat in the 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.859
 atmosphere of a place 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.829
 the atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air on the earth's surface 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.979
 humidity is the concentration of water vapor in the environment 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:53.979
 the people who study observe and analyze the different elements that 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.449
 they make up the climate they are called deteriorated they can predict how 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.199
 will be the time 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.799
 who do not even consider that this revenge aciar under the bright sun 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.079
 monteverdi that you stay at home because it will happen 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.129
 Meteorologists to comment on how the weather will be there is no job in 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.109
 the n-iv and national played some mysterious technique they are based on 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.279
 Measuring instruments such as walter meters thermometers 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.809
 rain gauges 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.579
 for or meters among others 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.699
 doubt the measures that throw these instruments are ordered as 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.959
 statistics that approach the definition of the climate of an area 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.329
 for example 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.749
 to measure the temperature entity the thermometer 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.149
 the atmospheric pressure with the barometer 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.239
 atmospheric humidity with the meter title 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.849
 there are some so-called climatic factors pel canvi aqua pecan two 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.519
 weather elements 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.169
 these are 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.029
 altitude 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.739
 the attitude 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.499
 doceaÃ±istas currents 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.119
 the atmospheric pressure 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.029
 the relief 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.819
 the winds 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.909
 humidity 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.569
 the proximity of the seas 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.569
 the influence of the nature of the soil 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.740
 and the vegetation let's see some of them 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:36.430
 the altitude at this height above sea level taken from a zero level 

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:41.879
 if you live in a mountainous region you are doing a higher altitude you would receive 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:47.109
 hours in a place near the sea we can distinguish with five thermal floors 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.849
 warm in 3 0 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.529
 one thousand meters above sea level 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.770
 I have employed between individuals 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.020
 the 2000 meters cold not from 2000 to three thousand meters 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.110
 and from there on we found the iag cloudy coastline 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.800
 now let's talk about the latitude 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.820
 it is determined according to the proximity of the distancing and a 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.759
 place with respect to the equator line 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.509
 the dividend by radio in all hemispheres 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.150
 north engel 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.349
 the pcv 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.379
 the proximity to the equator increases the atmospheric heat 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.449
 its distance towards the poles does not diminish 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.130
 ocean currents can cause effects after 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.400
 the managers 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.930
 days cause declines 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.719
 and rainfall 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.679
 the change in the warm currents still I am the temperatures 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.490
 of vegetation we will talk about later as there is a lot to tell
