these<00:01:12.210> different<00:01:12.390> things<00:01:12.710> very<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:13.799> very

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
these different things very very very

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.640 
these different things very very very
useful<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.600> application<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.229> let's<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
useful as an application so let's go and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.249 
useful as an application so let's go and
take<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> other<00:01:17.430> ones

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
take a look at some of the other ones

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.060 
take a look at some of the other ones
let's<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:20.330> pronunciations<00:01:21.330> we'll<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
let's use pronunciations we'll have the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.899 
let's use pronunciations we'll have the
word<00:01:23.460> test<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> download<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
word test here you have to download the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.280 
word test here you have to download the
pronunciation<00:01:27.540> add-on<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.110> assuming

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
pronunciation add-on so I'm assuming

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
pronunciation add-on so I'm assuming
that's<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> speak<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> word<00:01:29.670> back<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that's going to speak the word back to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
that's going to speak the word back to
you<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.570> cool<00:01:30.869> also<00:01:31.650> random
