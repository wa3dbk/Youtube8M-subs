00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it wasn't that hard so if you're not a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.830 
it wasn't that hard so if you're not a
dancer<00:02:18.099> like<00:02:18.519> don't<00:02:19.030> freak<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> lot<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.430 
people like they weren't having trouble
with<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.450> most<00:02:22.659> people<00:02:22.900> were<00:02:22.989> getting<00:02:23.140> it
