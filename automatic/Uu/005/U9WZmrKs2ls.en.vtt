00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
breaths for each movement in and then

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.300 
breaths for each movement in and then
three<00:02:09.149> breaths<00:02:09.479> out<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.190> look

like this inhale inhale inhale exhale

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:29.420 
like this inhale inhale inhale exhale
exhale<00:02:20.780> exhale<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.690> is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.880 

and<00:02:29.819> exhale

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.700 

so<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.580> counts<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.060> set<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.470> we're<00:02:37.590> going

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
so that counts as one set so we're going

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.410 
so that counts as one set so we're going
to<00:02:37.800> inhale<00:02:38.900> three<00:02:39.900> times<00:02:41.660> smooth<00:02:42.920> exhale

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.960 

we're<00:02:48.420> releasing<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.140> anger<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.850> on

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
we're releasing that anger so it's on

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
we're releasing that anger so it's on
each<00:02:51.180> breath<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:54.380> deeper<00:02:55.520> exhale<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.410> each

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
each breath in in deeper exhale so each

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.290 
each breath in in deeper exhale so each
one<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.950> these<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.280> going<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.520> count<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
one of these is going to count as just a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.980 
one of these is going to count as just a
set<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:05.010> should<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:05.280> thirty<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.670> day

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
set of one and we should do thirty a day

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.860 
set of one and we should do thirty a day
