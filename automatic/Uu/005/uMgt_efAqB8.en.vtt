 the fuel you sell from the well has already 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 mixture because the percentage of alcohol is 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 elements used here has already had element 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.920

 left line browser one more time 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 up front is a profitable trade where 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.020
 for them the cost is zero and for the owner of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 it is also very profitable that he 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.289
 pays about 1 real or liter of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.859
