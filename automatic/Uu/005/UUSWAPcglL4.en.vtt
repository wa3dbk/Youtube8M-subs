00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 the 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.260
 the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.710
 2006 was the year that this generation 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.900
 I am 100th as the generation 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.330
 Europe came on the market and that car that 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.420
 stood out in particular for its bizarre 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.400
 appearance and karate cordial 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.750
 basically yourself and love it or not 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 you can determine yourself but they hundreds 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.980
 just the head of design with it 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.520
 that is quite a leading one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 prize in the design world 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.190
 modern design of the city it had too 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.260
 a number of benefits especially that there 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.850
 huge trunk in this old one 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.280
 larger than, for example, that of the BMW 3 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.590
 series from time but also just hundreds 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.489
 bigger than that of the competition 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.110
 golf ford focus that kind of cars and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.420
 I was chad the downside which are the till 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.920
 The rear headroom is not on hold 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.559
 so that's something to be reckoned with 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.300
 when you buy this car 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.190
 while you have kids i mention what 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.800
 smaller in the eye of fine but if 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.790
 we get longer then you still have 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.570
 just keep that seat position 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.520
 rear becomes less comfortable 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.690
 interior is very much on the side 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.220
 driver oriented 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.590
 I really have everything I need 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.840
 within reach and that goes so far 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.790
 even that yes I herco everything it here 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.140
 right next to the wheel I can do quite 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.420
 easy with 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.720
 in 2009 model became one more time 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.760
 refreshed 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.680
 And that model is mainly attract you 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 then two open air in drawers in front 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.470
 the grill pan that that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.290
 continuous trajectory of those lamps 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 a bit off and behind point exactly 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.080
 is different if you go looking for one 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.119
 facelift 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.210
 motorically almost started point 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.420
 four with 83 hp and it is not of course 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.550
 up to and including the 200 hp strong 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.030
 I am also a diesel couple at home 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.369
 was given the two point two CTDI 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.369
 and that block has 140 hp 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.910
 on cars cold steel about 130 of 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.819
 this one 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.110
 sig hatchbacks for sale are many 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.180
 more crockery for sale but those are 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.500
 all that hybrid they dance that are 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.140
 real totally different car that it 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.319
 not deal in this video 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.819
 Hatchbacks thereof are around 80% one 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.850
 gasoline car 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.260
 and remaining 20% it is 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.459
 diesel 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.939
 and about 93 percent 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.849
 vast majority are equipped with one 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.310
 manual gearbox and 7% is provided 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.090
 of a vending machine you want to look for 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.340
 air conditioner 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.040
 many cars have as standard but 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.250
 climate control slightly more rare 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.680
 65% of old has about 80% of that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.140
 cars has their form of herco 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.909
 do you want to look for such a honda yourself 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.220
 civic prices start at around 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.400
 560 100 euros for the ones with a lot 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.040
 miles and the wood on around one 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:16.409
 eurootje or 17,000 for a reasonable one 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:19.230
 fresh time park are also there 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.940
 points of attention that are of course there 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.950
 To start with, there are a number of rickles 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.069
 It was noted that this was especially true for the whole 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.989
 early cars 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.459
 first none on the first cars that the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.590
 factory fries the true van is trouble 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.389
 with the rear springs that had to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.370
 to be replaced 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.500
 In addition, there was a problem with water 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.680
 what on the fuel pump 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.689
 plug and plug thing remained 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.769
 and there went the coding and that will 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.989
 I engines sometimes care 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.189
 dropped out or just didn't want it at all 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.799
 start 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.049
 there has also been a fix for this 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.799
 and then there is also in particular at the 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.659
 first 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.819
 crx has been my problem with the handbrake 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.349
 and goes to the fact that the spring 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.760
 the release button is wrong 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.299
 it mounted which actually 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.980
 himself constantly yes of other him off 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.689
 get the not very useful 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.730
 if you are allergic to one 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.099
 hill or something and you think it's elegant 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.599
 lane and full you get out and see you too 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.689
 drive away 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.870
 so that also had to be fixed 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.209
 other features once every three 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.199
 the brake fluid should be good for a while 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.789
 to be looked at 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.470
 that's just a thing with this one 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.860
 car is important 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.990
 in addition, the interior sometimes seems something 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.340
 a lot of wear so certainly if 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.229
 you for a copy with some more 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 mileage or good checker 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.490
 there are none due to wear spots or holes 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.259
 in places where you could 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.320
 so expect the cheeks in particular 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.060
 of the chair that you source at the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.680
 boarding and alighting say because 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.740
 are still in places you usually like 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.419
 First the wear goes beyond 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.950
 we come back to the fun design 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.870
 and 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.460
 the windshield is part of the yes say 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.650
 but the robustness of the car is gone 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.570
 moment there are cracks in it then 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.820
 It may be that there is the whole thing 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.710
 wring more and yes you want that 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.960
 of course not so check well 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.580
 ahead of asterisks and cracks and 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.050
 cracks and things like that 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.040
 and if it is strong, let it go 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.510
 immediately repair two times two diesel 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.430
 seems very pleasant to us 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.520
 now have machine at layout 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.710
 read everywhere that it is 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.730
 but they do have ailments rest on him 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.010
 sometimes some oil 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.690
 so the oil level stops in the holes and stops 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.670
 another problem with those cars is 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.460
 that some cars and also have again 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.600
 namely with early copies already 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.010
 at around 50,000 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.450
 the kilometers turned a new one 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.340
 link needed and that is of course bad 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.150
 so don't ask if you go looking 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.000
 asked for 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.130
 so I diesel with few kilometers 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.690
 check that link for a while 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.080
 today is how it is replaced 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.340
 relatively expensive repair 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.290
 well further we have the machine 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.060
 as I told me at the beginning 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.160
 not very old with that machine 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.870
 has equipped approximately 7% of cars 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.880
 him hey guys shift 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.530
 Yeah so 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.930
 let's say that's not the most 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.700
 refined bakery is technically common 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.700
 well only yes it's just one 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.110
 bin and not necessarily very smoothly which 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.730
 switches 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.280
 they still call it a problem with headlights 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.890
 the cars from before the facelift 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.110
 they have quite a bit of wringing on you 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.540
 in the paint but the rat in the paint 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.130
 front bumper is going to cut 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.410
 also check carefully if none 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.590
 problems with lamps that me 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.710
 cause switching to the paint 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.800
 finally a problem with the 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.240
 codices and soybean oil seasons shoot 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.610
 sometimes in a minor failure causing it 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.990
 light comes on and stays on 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.670
 yes then it may be that your car is on 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.420
 comes with an empty battery 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.190
 stand 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.460
 silver peat thingy it's easy to 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.050
 fixation in itself but it is annoying 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.600
 it is a software update and after one 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.860
 mistake the people must be so should you 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.670
 ever against a problem on an even 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.900
 past the animals and then how could it be fast 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.550
 and then this copy 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.050
 we borrowed from car dealers in 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.319
 ets-leur 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.889
 And yes it is just properly performing them 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:11.990
 a point 4 and asset photo implementation 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.909
 with yes actually almost everything on and there 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.000
 only the navigation according to 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.000
 me 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:21.540
 model costs 1750 euros and 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.720
 also just rain fall under selling 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.720
 in front of
