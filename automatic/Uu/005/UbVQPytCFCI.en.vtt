00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.740
 first multiplayer game that will 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 in the channel the gameplay is at 60 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.750
 frames per second people and I'm already 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 super super ope as I do not like not like 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.699
 must many people wonder what 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 do where is the campaign since we 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 I had promised to follow software miren 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.530
 how they die because they do not know that the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.620
 map is toxic 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 then 3-20 is bellatín is unemployment 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.630
 to turn them off turn off the gas 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.630
 a lot of clouds 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.180
 this map people have to tighten the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.940
 buttons that do not peel or die 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.940
 with the many but the curtain 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.420
 thank you friends is not telling them the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.590
 campaign we started the campaign of the day of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.950
 today 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.270
 and more in need with an expensive and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.600
 know that the campaign is operational 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.600
 people 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.260
 it will come quite effect and it will not 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 be because the campaign is not even going to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.170
 60 pictures would be foolish to record it and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 upload it 60 frames the gameplays and that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.700
 you can see 60 pictures like this one 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.010
 I hope you are seeing well if you would like 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.350
 a little more resolution if they tell me 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.480
 and nothing happens if they want the same 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.170
 gameplay especially on some map or with 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.170
 some character 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.480
 I do not know with a specific corner 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.520
 leave in the comments I do not have all 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.020
 the characters obviously there are many 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 that were left out because the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.780
 they put like presale characters 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.390
 to have that shit on me that when 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.390
 they fall I can not finish them finishing 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.250
 chapters per day this because to 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.530
 finish it as quickly as possible and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.700
 dedicate ourselves to full to the multiplayer besides 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.500
 that I campaign in the clip 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.120
 take away the almost almost from milestone people 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.230
 then I will not be like that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.689
 playing this chapter to be able to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.459
 put it taste and already devote ourselves to 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.379
 multiplayer because because many things 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.599
 I want to bring you many videos 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.170
 Tips characters cantes of maps very 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.580
 good ones 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.580
 I'm not going to asturias 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.069
 and I bought the teacher's version 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.349
 so I have I have the griffin I have the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.000
 marcus I have all the pinche skins like that 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.000
 to decide something of your fucking mother 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.470
 but good people well the truth is that I 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.110
 I think I'm a better player even in 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.930
 this gray that the gray of war 3 this is 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.360
 like where I believe almost almost a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.360
 origin the origin of cancer as no 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.410
 hoffman 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.350
 and I hope they have gotten a look at 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.080
 the characters and I've seen several 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.340
 seen the wild presale singing I've 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.260
 seen at the beginning and samantha 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.769
 and there I told myself what it is that gives 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.769
 that too 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.740
 but hopefully and hopefully you did look at us in the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.420
 rank symbol so have 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.400
 It would be great to play with iron in this 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.400
 I play the truth 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.099
 It is a product of shit 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.099
 come people come 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.520
 and a plan is also being planned for it 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 series with career people go and do 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.060
 10 enough people 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.310
 so the content of going software 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.530
 especially the latest software is a 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.350
 stop on the channel or it will be butt over 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.760
 that nothing for people from videos that 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.760
 he had neglected them a little 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.160
 do not lock me 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
 here 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.689
 or yes 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.810
 but bastards 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.560
 hopefully and we want to play a 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.150
 third round because I the truth is that 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.020
 I can not stop this point from stealing 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.780
 yesterday I had the problems with the entity 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.620
 I recommend that they go to my channel and give 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.270
 continue because because there we are 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.960
 doing mostly on twitter like 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.360
 automatic on twitter so they know 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.919
 when we make screens but yesterday the 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.919
 screen was date that peta 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.689
 so what happened to my connection was 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:42.879
 put of vinci girl tights of punta güey 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:45.869
 and it was failing and it did not get fully assembled 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.869
 well the games 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.150
 new wow 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:58.240
 mine already finished 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.910
 no son of a bitch wen sons of the jazz menu 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.560
 now we dominate what kind what 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.240
 kind of woman, those people, I do not know what 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.300
 both unlocked should reach the level 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.550
 10 so why do not people think 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.380
 bring them many videos of more or less 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.360
 carries came the campaign video the 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.220
 first and already from day two tomorrow 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.260
 videos as I already told you I have thought 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.030
 upload is a video after milestone of this 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.980
 in a few hours or maybe the day of 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.410
 tomorrow I do not know about what it is that has 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.970
 this game that video looks and I know that at 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.190
 president prescott the site go 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.810
 dedicated to people who do not have the 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.790
 game that was asking me claustre 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.900
 If it's worth buying, I bought myself 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.580
 the deluxe version 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.960
 but there is a fairly accessible version 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.400
 which is the normal one of 794 96 pesos and 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.200
 Well, I want to make this video for you 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.360
 tell them what game modes you have that is 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.250
 the novelty that has what are the 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.900
 things that go unlocking then there's 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.980
 certain things that I want to mention 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.540
 those people to be encouraged to 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.860
 buy the game a lot of people are being 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.260
 complaining because it's not a game so 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.020
 fast as gears of war 3 but then 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.610
 good people is course were the best 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.560
 fact that they could have done contest 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.180
 but it is not go software ultimate edition 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.830
 great work of black 2 studies at 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.320
 less than he could play he did not have 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.930
 no mistake 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.970
 friction of which enters that is my connection 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.590
 and some servers that I 'm good at 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.560
 that is starting this but the truth 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.360
 people is a super recommended game in 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.340

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.390

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.860
