slick way it's thin with coverage which
I<00:03:59.729> don't<00:03:59.790> seen<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> lot<00:04:00.509> of<00:04:00.569> consumers<00:04:01.199> use<00:04:01.229> II

I don't seen a lot of consumers use II

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.300 
I don't seen a lot of consumers use II
usually<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.459> low<00:04:02.759> coverage<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.979> thin<00:04:04.979> or

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
usually it's low coverage and thin or

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.789

medium<00:04:08.759> coverage<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.479> thin<00:04:10.259> so<00:04:10.500> it's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
medium coverage and thin so it's

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.279
