00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello and welcome I already have not 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.049
 badly speak neutral gray filters 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 girls shout notes are light of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 sun of your lens they allow 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.630
 which is less light that happens to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.480
 sensors and so to do more 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.800
 long exposures 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.619
 I had you then I had you 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.449
 first talked about the neutral gray filter 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.430
 variable go it's a filter when I 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.320
 turns it 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.920
 they let more or less 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.349
 very practical light since we rule 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 perfectly the intensity of the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.260
 light protection but against it 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 still has several disadvantages the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 the bigger it is its quality 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 as soon as you work with this filter 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.200
 So very closed around 1 200 m or 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.570
 400 if you bought a step filter 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 very good not very good 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.710
 so not very expensive you found 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 x who appear on it and who in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 photo are almost crippling 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.910
 I use it very often to make 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.290
 video and / or photo I use it 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 earlier in low intensity up to n 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 goes down then I introduced you to the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.229
 the daddy of all the filters end and the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 filter end and 1000 it's a filter that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.400
 allows you in daylight to make 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 exposures of 8 15 or 30 seconds or even 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 more so 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.070
 I 'm learning a little about it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 fixed against a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.979
 a zoom lens a zoom against 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.369
 fixed focal so its very good quality 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 very interesting now I you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 presented the third type of filter 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.329
 neutral gray 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.110
 they are graduated neutral gray filters 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.930
 watch how it looks 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 a free and dark other green feel 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.290
 up and clear down to the opposite game 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.649
 if you simply bc 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.799
 so that's particularly convenient 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.420
 to increase the dynamic range of your 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.670
 pictures typically will end up 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 with areas a photo with them the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.439
 high for example very clear and the bottom to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 the shadow but if you put that all 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.759
 simply 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 your dark zone graduated to put a 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 the clearest place in your photo 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.440
 it all goes down as we see 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will see him 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.250
 eh ben lets you allow you to have 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 a photo with a very strong beach 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.250
 dynamic 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.750
 it exists in several powers so 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.850
 there I present you three models that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.940
 come with those with this kit so there 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:42.050
 you have a hand and 2nd and 4 and andy 8 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.050
 that is to say a diaf of dia and royal
