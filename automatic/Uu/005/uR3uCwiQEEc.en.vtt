the<00:01:38.579> League<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> Legends<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.299> also<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.780> life

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the League of Legends but also in life

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.630 
the League of Legends but also in life
so<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.159> start<00:01:41.610> living<00:01:41.970> together

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.039 

before<00:01:48.640> they'll<00:01:48.790> see<00:01:49.030> us<00:01:49.060> we<00:01:49.270> were<00:01:49.390> curious<00:01:49.600> if

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
before they'll see us we were curious if

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.249 
before they'll see us we were curious if
we<00:01:50.320> can<00:01:50.500> beat<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> best<00:01:51.460> teams<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:52.000> Europe<00:01:52.630> but

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.169 
right now because I mean my I'm started
four<00:02:08.140> four<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.429> last<00:02:09.580> place<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.000> they

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
four four one in the last place and they

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.930 
four four one in the last place and they
and<00:02:10.569> it's<00:02:10.750> really<00:02:11.350> bad<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.790> focus

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and it's really bad so we have to focus

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.030 
and it's really bad so we have to focus
on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.360> games<00:02:13.569> right<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.709> we<00:02:14.890> don't

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
on the games right now so we don't

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.580 
on the games right now so we don't
finish<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.780> well<00:02:16.780> everyone<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.350> saying

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
finish like that well everyone is saying

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.309 
finish like that well everyone is saying
that<00:02:17.800> we<00:02:17.920> play<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.489> be<00:02:18.670> good<00:02:18.819> as<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> team<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:20.290> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
that we play and be good as a team but I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.440 
that we play and be good as a team but I
think<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:21.130> still<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> lot<00:02:22.300> of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
think we can still and do a lot of

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.309 
think we can still and do a lot of
things<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.750> improve<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.260> some<00:02:24.100> corner<00:02:24.459> about

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
things to improve it some corner about

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.770 
things to improve it some corner about
getting<00:02:26.319> even<00:02:26.560> better<00:02:27.069> in<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.400> future<00:02:27.780> but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
getting even better in the future but

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.229 
getting even better in the future but
yeah<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.200> think<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.800> first<00:02:30.069> place<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.610> 7/3<00:02:31.209> is

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
yeah I think that first place in 7/3 is

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.870 
yeah I think that first place in 7/3 is
very<00:02:31.810> good<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.380> us<00:02:32.410> now<00:02:32.709> they<00:02:33.459> haven't<00:02:33.760> had

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
very good for us now they haven't had

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.610 
very good for us now they haven't had
the<00:02:33.970> environment<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.840> actually<00:02:35.260> use<00:02:35.440> their

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the environment to actually use their

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.039 
the environment to actually use their
individual<00:02:36.100> skill<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.400> their<00:02:36.519> throws

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
individual skill to their throws

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.920 
individual skill to their throws
potential<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.769> think<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.519> at<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.819> moment

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
potential so I think that at the moment

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.980 
potential so I think that at the moment
they<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.080> lot<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> room<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.650> grow
