transplant procedure this is a 0.5

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
transplant procedure this is a 0.5
millimeter<00:00:09.240> blade<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.230> see<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.410> tiny<00:00:10.679> it

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
millimeter blade you can see how tiny it

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.339 
millimeter blade you can see how tiny it
is<00:00:10.920> I'll<00:00:11.190> use<00:00:11.300> 0.6<00:00:12.300> millimeters<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> body

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
is I'll use 0.6 millimeters for the body

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.499 
is I'll use 0.6 millimeters for the body
for<00:00:13.740> two<00:00:13.889> hair<00:00:14.070> grafts<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:15.089> basically<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
for two hair grafts but basically the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.820 
for two hair grafts but basically the
eyebrow<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.809> divided<00:00:16.109> into<00:00:16.260> three<00:00:16.529> portions

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
eyebrow is divided into three portions

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
eyebrow is divided into three portions
the<00:00:17.340> head<00:00:17.609> which<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> hair<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the head which is where the hair is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720 
the head which is where the hair is
mostly<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.160> vertical<00:00:20.520> direction

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
mostly going up in a vertical direction

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
mostly going up in a vertical direction
then<00:00:21.689> very<00:00:21.960> quickly<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.439> grow<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
then very quickly they grow in a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.980 
then very quickly they grow in a
crosshatch<00:00:23.310> pattern<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.880> upper<00:00:24.180> hairs<00:00:24.359> grow

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
crosshatch pattern the upper hairs grow

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.480 
crosshatch pattern the upper hairs grow
downwards<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> bottom<00:00:25.859> hairs<00:00:26.010> grow<00:00:26.160> upwards

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
downwards the bottom hairs grow upwards

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.689 
downwards the bottom hairs grow upwards
in<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.390> crosshatch<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> body<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
in a crosshatch in the in the body of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
in a crosshatch in the in the body of
course<00:00:30.210> such<00:00:30.330> pattern<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> body<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.289> then

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
course such pattern in the body and then

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.610 
course such pattern in the body and then
lastly<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> tail<00:00:32.660> patients<00:00:33.660> lost<00:00:34.260> most<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
outlines and you see how flat on making

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
outlines and you see how flat on making
them<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:56.969> hairs<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.629> on

them and you see how these hairs all on

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
them and you see how these hairs all on
the<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:58.949> grow<00:00:59.190> straight

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the top are gonna grow straight

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.590 
the top are gonna grow straight
downwards<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.770> you'll<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.600> continue

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
downwards and you'll see as I continue

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.070 
downwards and you'll see as I continue
to<00:01:03.629> proceed<00:01:03.840> laterally<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> these<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.990> going

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to proceed laterally so these are going

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.310 
to proceed laterally so these are going
to<00:01:07.140> grow<00:01:07.320> straight<00:01:07.650> downwards<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> know

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to grow straight downwards now I know

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.450 
to grow straight downwards now I know
that<00:01:11.130> very<00:01:11.400> quickly<00:01:11.820> along<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> top<00:01:13.460> portion

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that very quickly along the top portion

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
that very quickly along the top portion
of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> head<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.020> quickly<00:01:16.200> grow<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
of the head they very quickly grow in a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.719 
of the head they very quickly grow in a
more<00:01:17.180> vertical<00:01:18.180> horizontal<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:19.470> vertical

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
more vertical horizontal to vertical

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
more vertical horizontal to vertical
direction<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.799> area

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
direction so you see in the this area

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.770 
direction so you see in the this area
they're<00:01:23.310> growing<00:01:23.520> ohm<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> directly<00:01:24.210> vertical

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they're growing ohm is directly vertical

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.539 
they're growing ohm is directly vertical
let's<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.650> back<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.250> again

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
let's go back out here again

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
let's go back out here again
I've<00:01:27.150> always<00:01:27.330> started<00:01:27.659> making<00:01:27.930> these<00:01:28.080> which

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I've always started making these which

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.539 
I've always started making these which
are<00:01:28.530> growing<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.340> upward<00:01:29.670> direction

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
are growing in an upward direction

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
are growing in an upward direction
upward<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.820> lateral<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.990> once

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
upward and lateral and you see once

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.090 
upward and lateral and you see once
again<00:01:36.229> staying<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.439> flat

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.070 

and<00:01:45.400> as<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.090> proceeded<00:01:46.659> more<00:01:46.990> immediately

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
and as I proceeded more immediately

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.890 
and as I proceeded more immediately
towards<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:51.210> towards<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.479> head<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
towards the towards the head of the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.210 
towards the towards the head of the
eyebrow<00:01:53.260> they're<00:01:53.650> going<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.860> very<00:01:54.040> quickly

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
eyebrow they're going to very quickly

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.750 
eyebrow they're going to very quickly
grow<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.880> more<00:01:55.050> vertical<00:01:56.050> direction

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
grow in a more vertical direction

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.950 
grow in a more vertical direction
upwards<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.180> actually<00:01:58.510> see<00:01:58.840> that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
upwards and you can actually see that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.050 
upwards and you can actually see that
that's<00:01:59.140> paralleling<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> natural<00:02:00.940> direction

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
that's paralleling the natural direction

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's paralleling the natural direction
of<00:02:01.450> growth<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.810> our<00:02:01.900> eyebrows<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:02.590> I've<00:02:02.680> done

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
of growth of our eyebrows so I've done

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.010 
of growth of our eyebrows so I've done
the<00:02:02.979> outer<00:02:03.160> basically<00:02:03.610> I've<00:02:03.670> done<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the outer basically I've done the the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.109 
the outer basically I've done the the
outside<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.890> perimeter<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.520> go<00:02:06.759> back<00:02:06.940> out

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
outside of the perimeter I go back out

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:15.810 
outside of the perimeter I go back out
here<00:02:07.360> again<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.920> make<00:02:12.100> another<00:02:12.370> row<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.610> I'm

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
here again and I make another row so I'm

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:27.550 
here again and I make another row so I'm
still<00:02:16.090> going<00:02:16.240> downwards

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.190 

and<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:28.580> madrix<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.150> expediency<00:02:29.930> I'm<00:02:30.050> going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and for madrix of expediency I'm going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.260 
and for madrix of expediency I'm going
to<00:02:30.260> show<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.470> once<00:02:30.740> again<00:02:30.890> how<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:31.819> then<00:02:32.060> come

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
to show you once again how I then come

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to show you once again how I then come
back<00:02:32.480> again<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:35.150> time<00:02:36.220> growing<00:02:37.220> upwards<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
back again this time growing upwards so

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.809 
back again this time growing upwards so
once<00:02:39.530> again<00:02:39.680> creating<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.250> crosshatch

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
once again creating that crosshatch

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:50.290 
once again creating that crosshatch
pattern

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.480 

and<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.320> these<00:02:51.470> small<00:02:51.770> blades<00:02:52.010> I'm<00:02:52.250> able<00:02:52.460> to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
and with these small blades I'm able to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.380 
and with these small blades I'm able to
work<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.880> between<00:02:57.370> each<00:02:58.370> prior<00:02:58.970> recipients

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
work in between each prior recipients

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.120 
work in between each prior recipients
thing<00:02:59.540> now<00:02:59.660> I'm<00:02:59.720> using<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.140> 0.6<00:03:00.710> millimeter

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
thing now I'm using as 0.6 millimeter

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.350 
thing now I'm using as 0.6 millimeter
sipping<00:03:01.430> sight<00:03:01.610> because<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.060> where<00:03:02.210> they

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
sipping sight because this is where they

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.230 
sipping sight because this is where they
the<00:03:03.050> slightly<00:03:03.830> larger<00:03:04.370> two<00:03:04.610> hair<00:03:04.820> grafts<00:03:05.060> are

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
the slightly larger two hair grafts are

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.910 
the slightly larger two hair grafts are
going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.420> grow<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.260> once<00:03:06.470> again<00:03:06.620> I'm

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
going to grow and once again I'm

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.240 
going to grow and once again I'm
reinforcing<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.210> crosshatch<00:03:08.720> pattern

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
reinforcing that crosshatch pattern

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.860 
reinforcing that crosshatch pattern
these<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.700> superior<00:03:11.420> hairs<00:03:11.570> are<00:03:11.720> going

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
these the superior hairs are going

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.870 
these the superior hairs are going
downwards<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.800> meanwhile<00:03:13.220> these<00:03:13.370> inferior

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
downwards and meanwhile these inferior

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080 
downwards and meanwhile these inferior
hairs<00:03:14.090> are<00:03:14.690> going<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.960> go<00:03:15.050> upwards

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
hairs are going to go upwards

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.570 
hairs are going to go upwards
don't<00:03:17.090> use<00:03:17.300> twos<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.040> body<00:03:19.250> I

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
don't use twos in the in the body I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.090 
don't use twos in the in the body I
rather<00:03:20.270> in<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.510> tail<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.080> eyebrow<00:03:21.230> so

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
rather in the tail of the eyebrow so

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.620 
rather in the tail of the eyebrow so
this<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> nice<00:03:22.580> example<00:03:22.760> these<00:03:23.270> are<00:03:23.420> growing

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
this is a nice example these are growing

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.230 
this is a nice example these are growing
upwards<00:03:23.960> and<00:03:24.410> these<00:03:25.370> are<00:03:25.520> going<00:03:25.670> downwards

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
upwards and these are going downwards

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.300 
upwards and these are going downwards
once<00:03:26.600> again<00:03:26.900> hopefully<00:03:27.440> using<00:03:27.920> two<00:03:28.130> hair

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
once again hopefully using two hair

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.130 
once again hopefully using two hair
grafts<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.840> get<00:03:30.020> a<00:03:30.400> nice<00:03:32.140> density

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
grafts so we get a nice density

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.350 
grafts so we get a nice density
essentially<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.490> you<00:03:34.580> see<00:03:34.790> we've<00:03:34.970> got<00:03:35.090> these

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
essentially so you see we've got these

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.420 
essentially so you see we've got these
hairs<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.930> superior<00:03:36.410> strong<00:03:36.740> more<00:03:36.980> downward

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
hairs the superior strong more downward

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.560 
hairs the superior strong more downward
downward<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:40.150> infra<00:03:41.150> air<00:03:41.240> has<00:03:41.360> grown

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
downward and the infra air has grown

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.900 
downward and the infra air has grown
more<00:03:41.750> soup<00:03:42.080> airily<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.340> once<00:03:43.490> again<00:03:43.640> I'm

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
more soup airily so once again I'm

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:55.699 
more soup airily so once again I'm
making<00:03:45.160> more<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.370> crosshatch<00:03:46.940> pattern

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.270 

and<00:03:56.159> then<00:03:56.400> as<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.760> proceed<00:03:57.209> Morris

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
and then as we proceed Morris

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.759 
and then as we proceed Morris
immediately<00:03:59.689> and<00:04:00.689> this<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.379> where<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> two

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
immediately and this is where the two

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.959 
immediately and this is where the two
hair<00:04:01.950> grafts<00:04:02.159> are<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.609> pretty<00:04:02.790> much

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
hair grafts are going to pretty much

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.789 
hair grafts are going to pretty much
stop<00:04:03.239> right<00:04:03.540> around<00:04:03.659> here

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
stop right around here

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.339 
stop right around here
so<00:04:05.310> then<00:04:05.430> what<00:04:05.549> I'll<00:04:05.670> do<00:04:05.849> once<00:04:06.150> again<00:04:06.480> I'll<00:04:07.260> go

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
so then what I'll do once again I'll go

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.770 
so then what I'll do once again I'll go
back<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.709> my<00:04:07.829> 0.5<00:04:08.640> millimeter<00:04:09.090> recipient<00:04:09.569> site

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
back to my 0.5 millimeter recipient site

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:23.680 
back to my 0.5 millimeter recipient site
and<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:11.040> do<00:04:11.159> some<00:04:11.370> filling<00:04:11.790> in

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.580 

thank<00:04:24.290> you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.620 

and<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.340> can<00:04:30.490> see<00:04:30.700> once<00:04:30.910> again<00:04:31.030> I'm<00:04:31.330> making

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
and you can see once again I'm making

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.260 
and you can see once again I'm making
more<00:04:34.630> recipient<00:04:35.530> sites<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.610> then<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.970> finish

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
more recipient sites and then to finish

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.150 
more recipient sites and then to finish
up<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:39.190> section

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.310 

but<00:04:45.820> what<00:04:46.180> we'll<00:04:46.330> do<00:04:46.540> now<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.750> we'll<00:04:47.050> start

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
but what we'll do now is we'll start

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.100 
but what we'll do now is we'll start
planting<00:04:47.710> those<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.660> then<00:04:49.840> I'll<00:04:49.930> come

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
planting those and and then I'll come

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.990 
planting those and and then I'll come
back<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.320> make<00:04:50.620> some<00:04:50.650> more<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:51.310> further<00:04:51.760> round

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
back and make some more to further round

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.090 
back and make some more to further round
it<00:04:52.180> out<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.360> make<00:04:52.630> them<00:04:53.350> ready<00:04:53.500> man<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.830> can't

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
it out and make them ready man I can't

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.770 
it out and make them ready man I can't
see<00:04:54.340> already<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.730> we're<00:04:55.390> gonna<00:04:55.510> need<00:04:55.630> to

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
see already that we're gonna need to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.010 
see already that we're gonna need to
bring<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.560> one<00:04:56.770> up<00:04:56.890> just<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.400> little<00:04:57.430> bit<00:04:57.820> here

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
bring this one up just a little bit here

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.780 
bring this one up just a little bit here
but<00:04:59.020> I'll<00:04:59.170> be<00:04:59.320> that'd<00:04:59.620> be<00:04:59.650> better<00:05:00.010> assess<00:05:00.460> once

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
but I'll be that'd be better assess once

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.600 
but I'll be that'd be better assess once
the<00:05:01.030> patient<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.780> sitting<00:05:02.500> upright<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.520> we
