00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.469
 this time we will draw the character 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.930
 of coconut in its children's version in a 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.940
 profile view we will do it in three 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.460
 simple steps step number 1 what 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.790
 we are going to be doing in green the 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.650
 the first step will be the proportions 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.360
 we make three divisions these will be the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.290
 proportions of the body that is more or 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.079
 minus the size of the head 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.989
 multiplied by three and we're going to draw 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:32.020
 a vertical line that will help us 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.700
 have the center of the body a north that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.340
 will be serving us well let's 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.090
 continue with step number two in 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.000
 red color almost occupying all the first 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.440
 section let's draw a circle like 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.679
 we are doing it now we almost occupy 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.320
 the entire first division and we draw it 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.960
 in the center of the line and we add a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 small section for the head and then 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.879
 in the left part of our 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.969
 vertical center line we draw the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.640
 neck in front and we started sketching 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.620
 what will be something like the belly of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.970
 our character and in the part of the 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.050
 back we have to be aware that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.030
 let's find two curves well 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.850
 pronounced a curve to 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.900
 something like that and a curve for the buttocks 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.610
 this line move to the second division 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.950
 more or less like that and we're going to complete 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.380
 also here the opposite of the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.200
 body and we join it in such a way that the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.330
 body has the overall similar shape 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 to that of a handle this handle can 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.830
 serve as a reference at the moment 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.840
 we are you sketching this body and 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.369
 now we have to sketch the legs 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.659
 we are going to make them a little bit shorter 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.909
 that the size of the third division 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.350
 so that the character looks more 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.140
 infant legs should not be 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.390
 long and following the center line 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.550
 vertical we draw the back of 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 the leg and the front part of the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.630
 leg following the curve of the species 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.050
 of mango we had drawn now the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.460
 arms we draw also slightly 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.060
 leaning forward towards the part 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.110
 in front of the body and the arms are 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.460
 equally wide in the part of the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 shoulders of equal width in the part 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.899
 of hands are constant in terms of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.380
 its shape and now we start with the step 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.750
 number 3 which is to place the details with 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 we start with fists 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.740
 a little here on the neck and the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.450
 sleeves that will be of our character 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.060
 now we draw the tape here more or 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.010
 less in the part where I had the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.420
 depression in the handle more or less there 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.750
 we draw the tape and draw the part 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.730
 that fly out of the tape a small 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.410
 fold here that the bulges is 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.020
 same fabric in the back is 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.700
 bulges a little bit the paste and following 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.830
 more or less here the form of the of the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.870
 part in front of the legs 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.640
 we almost follow the shape of the pieces 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 here a straight line and here we follow the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:58.250
 curved shape back of the legs 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:01.220
 for clothes more or less like that only 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.350
 now the hands we draw here 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.140
 we simulate each of the knuckles is 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.209
 very little we draw now the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.670
 arms we look for a division here for 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.850
 the elbow and we draw a section of the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.880
 forearm an area for the biceps 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.020
 but they are sections are very divisions 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.050
 barely marked 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.680
 and then we finish with some small 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.989
 details a few folds in the clothes 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.109
 they are rich are very few and very 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.049
 simple little curved lines and 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.900
 we also detail a little 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.210
 shoes 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.490
 of our character 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.550
 something like that are pretty simple 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.110
 these shoes really and well in the 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.760
 profile head we did in another 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.380
 video for it this time we 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.860
 we complain in very fast camera well this 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.950
 it was the third step we only put 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.120
 other details like the staff that 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.850
 it is always loading carrying this 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.160
 staff is almost vertical and in this way 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.740
 we finished our drawing the tail 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.220
 we do with question form let's go 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.080
 to add to a fourth step which will be 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.670
 clean our sketch but then 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.430
 really with the first three steps 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.890
 our drawing was finished only 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.020
 we do this fourth step so you see 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.930
 how useful is our sketch and the 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.820
 how you can clean your drawing 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the description are the links that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.669
 they will take you in the study of this 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.190
 character in the different angles of 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.229
 body we study this character in their 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.910
 angles because it's a perfect example of 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.979
 infant proportions manga 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.990
 because the characters that you draw and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.060
 that you study you should know how to draw in 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.919
 every view and because the character is 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.990
 famous and therefore not tired 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.500
 practice it I hope you liked it and 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.500
 until next time
