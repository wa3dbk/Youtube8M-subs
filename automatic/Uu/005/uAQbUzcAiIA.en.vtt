00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello dear friends with you camp 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 and today we will have such a small 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.559
 mod and i wouldn't say he's funny 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.470
 or cool he just 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 add justice to the game that is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 I have met such people who are not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.869
 like the mod tree capitator that is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 considers teacher because he sometimes 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 cut down a tree and take away the leg of an ax 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.330
 that is , there are of course others but still 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 I consider it cheat because 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.430
 to cut down the laser so we move 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.800
 serzh one punch i have met such 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.829
 people who don't like this one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 change that is let's take simple 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 the ax is not even we did not call I caused 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 just and ax and chop the tree see 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.870
 what she didn't cut down with since 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 treecapitator for not installed what the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 okay just 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.879
 This mod adds to the game like this 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 hatchet is a very fair hatchet 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 craft it because it is very expensive 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.890
 craft it is 5 diamonds and two 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 stick and get here is such an ax ax 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.650
 chick and the motor is insanely expensive so he also 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 breaks quickly if they join at all 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 in a fight then it's just useless that is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 it's just a waste of diamonds and this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 mod no this ax will allow us to chop down 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 the tree is like this 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.740
 that is, it acts as a treecapitator 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.009
 only with the fact that only free 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 such an ax tree that is, it is clear 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.899
