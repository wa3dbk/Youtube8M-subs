competition<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.800> out<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.570> that's<00:00:48.570> possible

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
competition up out there that's possible

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.540 
competition up out there that's possible
and<00:00:49.579> they<00:00:50.579> win<00:00:51.110> about<00:00:52.110> 90<00:00:52.890> percent<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.370> their

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

and they win about 90 percent of their
fights<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.469> mean<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.010> an<00:00:56.309> average

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
fights I mean that's just an average

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.500

guess<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.050> possibly<00:00:58.260> win<00:00:59.000> 10019<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
guess they can possibly win 10019 and

here that I'm showing you I don't know

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.069 
here that I'm showing you I don't know
if<00:03:28.370> how<00:03:28.879> well<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.269> gonna<00:03:29.569> turn<00:03:29.840> out<00:03:30.049> but

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
if how well this is gonna turn out but

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.559 
if how well this is gonna turn out but
I've<00:03:30.469> I<00:03:30.769> hope<00:03:31.069> hopefully<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.969> you've<00:03:32.359> seen

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
I've I hope hopefully you're you've seen

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.629 
I've I hope hopefully you're you've seen
it<00:03:32.749> okay<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.079> try<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> put<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.829> light<00:03:34.069> on<00:03:34.249> top<00:03:34.459> of

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
it okay I try to put a light on top of

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.559 
it okay I try to put a light on top of
it<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.799> can<00:03:36.829> see<00:03:37.219> partly<00:03:37.969> why<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.180> because

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
it but you can see partly why is because

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.000 
it but you can see partly why is because
the<00:03:38.840> water<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:41.510> little<00:03:41.870> brownish<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.829> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
the water is a little brownish and the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.059 
the water is a little brownish and the
reason<00:03:43.310> for<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.609> is<00:03:43.760> because<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.680> drop<00:03:45.680> almond

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
reason for that is because I drop almond

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.580 
reason for that is because I drop almond
leaves<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.400> there<00:03:46.609> um<00:03:47.019> it's<00:03:48.019> just<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.669> natural

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
leaves in there um it's just the natural

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.839 
leaves in there um it's just the natural
you<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:51.620> see<00:03:51.919> in<00:03:51.980> here<00:03:52.159> at<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.430> bottom<00:03:52.699> of<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
you can see in here at the bottom of the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.879 
you can see in here at the bottom of the
tank<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.959> just<00:03:54.169> the<00:03:54.319> natural<00:03:54.769> environment

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
tank it's just the natural environment

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.530 
tank it's just the natural environment
that<00:03:55.430> they<00:03:55.549> live<00:03:55.699> in<00:03:57.310> where<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.340> live<00:03:58.699> the<00:03:58.939> pH<00:03:59.299> is

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
that they live in where I live the pH is

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.729 
that they live in where I live the pH is
well<00:04:00.199> over<00:04:00.769> eighty<00:04:01.180> eight<00:04:02.180> point<00:04:02.480> five<00:04:02.810> so

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
well over eighty eight point five so

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.129 
well over eighty eight point five so
they<00:04:03.859> wouldn't<00:04:04.099> beat<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.459> pee<00:04:04.669> in<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.790> so

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
they wouldn't beat a pee in that so

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.990 
they wouldn't beat a pee in that so
that's<00:04:06.139> why<00:04:06.349> you<00:04:06.409> look<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.489> almond<00:04:07.790> leaves

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
that's why you look the almond leaves

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.610 
that's why you look the almond leaves
are<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.269> there<00:04:08.479> and<00:04:08.689> that's<00:04:08.900> why<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.169> water<00:04:09.470> is

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
are in there and that's why the water is

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.300 
are in there and that's why the water is
a<00:04:09.709> little<00:04:09.919> brownish<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.729> but<00:04:11.949> that's<00:04:12.949> dirt

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
a little brownish and but that's dirt

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.670 
a little brownish and but that's dirt
through<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.239> natural<00:04:14.419> environment<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.259> that's

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
through a natural environment and that's

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.199 
through a natural environment and that's
the<00:04:16.009> pH<00:04:16.310> level<00:04:16.699> that<00:04:16.849> you're<00:04:17.060> most

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
the pH level that you're most

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.339 
the pH level that you're most
comfortable<00:04:17.419> at<00:04:19.509> you<00:04:20.509> can<00:04:20.659> see<00:04:20.840> there<00:04:21.139> they're

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
comfortable at you can see there they're

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.339 
comfortable at you can see there they're
starting<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:22.419> saw<00:04:23.419> aggressive<00:04:23.870> there<00:04:24.110> that

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
starting to I saw aggressive there that

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.710 
starting to I saw aggressive there that
trust<00:04:24.800> me<00:04:24.949> they<00:04:25.099> know<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:26.300> they<00:04:26.449> can't

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
trust me they know that that they can't

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.850 
trust me they know that that they can't
reach<00:04:26.900> each<00:04:27.110> other<00:04:27.229> right<00:04:27.440> now<00:04:27.500> there's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
reach each other right now there's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.659 
reach each other right now there's
there's<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.490> glass<00:04:28.669> wall<00:04:29.000> but<00:04:29.270> they're<00:04:30.229> still

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
there's a glass wall but they're still

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.740 
there's a glass wall but they're still
they're<00:04:31.669> still<00:04:31.699> trying<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.240> strike<00:04:32.570> each

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
they're still trying to strike each

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:44.170 
they're still trying to strike each
other

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.940 

so<00:04:44.750> once<00:04:45.170> again<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.590> don't<00:04:45.650> know<00:04:45.770> if<00:04:45.860> I

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
so once again I don't know if I

about three and a half months old

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.740 
about three and a half months old
maybe<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.110> little<00:04:51.350> bit<00:04:51.590> older<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.150> suggest

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
maybe a little bit older and I suggest

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.680 
maybe a little bit older and I suggest
everyone<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.380> buys<00:04:54.560> betas<00:04:55.480> doesn't<00:04:56.480> matter

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
everyone that buys betas doesn't matter

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.370 
everyone that buys betas doesn't matter
what

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
straining it's happening like odds half

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.750 
straining it's happening like odds half
moons<00:05:00.380> or<00:05:01.360> whatever<00:05:02.860> strain<00:05:03.860> or<00:05:04.340> breed<00:05:04.550> you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760

moons or whatever strain or breed you
have<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.420> would<00:05:05.570> recommend<00:05:06.170> buying<00:05:06.380> them<00:05:06.620> young
