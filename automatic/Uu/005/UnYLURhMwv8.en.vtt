there I couldn't get the snooze for the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.060 
there I couldn't get the snooze for the
alarm<00:01:35.340> clock<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.750> -<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> -

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
alarm clock but I got - I got it -

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670 
alarm clock but I got - I got it -
everything<00:01:38.610> else<00:01:38.790> another<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.290> would

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
everything else another thing is I would

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
everything else another thing is I would
say<00:01:40.860> mute<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.090> would<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
say mute and it would go back to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.460 
say mute and it would go back to
previous<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> thought<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:44.880> interesting

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
previous so I thought that's interesting

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.749 
previous so I thought that's interesting
considering<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:47.100> recognize<00:01:47.520> other

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
considering it doesn't recognize other

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
considering it doesn't recognize other
words<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.299> seems<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> recognize<00:01:48.810> mute<00:01:49.649> but

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
words but it seems to recognize mute but

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
words but it seems to recognize mute but
it<00:01:50.610> wants<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> track<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.909> anyway<00:01:54.020> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it wants to go back a track so anyway so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.590 
it wants to go back a track so anyway so
to<00:01:55.080> trigger<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.399> trigger<00:01:56.880> s<00:01:57.119> voice<00:01:57.330> by

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
to trigger these it trigger s voice by

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.679 
to trigger these it trigger s voice by
doing<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> double<00:01:58.170> tab<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> did<00:02:00.060> turn<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
doing a double tab if you did turn that

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.070 
doing a double tab if you did turn that
off<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:02.000> find<00:02:03.000> s<00:02:03.240> voice<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.869> apps

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
off you could find s voice in your apps

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.050 
off you could find s voice in your apps
right<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.069> it<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.550> do<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.819> same<00:02:06.000> thing

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
right and it would do the same thing

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.380 
right and it would do the same thing
then<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.110> settings<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.640> hit<00:02:08.970> menu<00:02:09.239> and

then go to settings right hit menu and
go<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.539> settings<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:11.130> you're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.519> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
go to settings and then you're going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.350 
go to settings and then you're going to
see<00:02:12.230> control<00:02:13.230> apps<00:02:13.530> okay<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.209> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
see control apps okay and then if you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.449 
see control apps okay and then if you
have<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.540> off<00:02:15.810> although<00:02:16.530> those<00:02:16.920> functions

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
have it off although those functions

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.090 
have it off although those functions
that<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:17.790> saw<00:02:18.000> would<00:02:18.269> be<00:02:18.450> disabled<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.290> maybe

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that we saw would be disabled and maybe

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.610 
that we saw would be disabled and maybe
it<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.430> save<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:20.790> battery<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.569> well

but<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.400> episode<00:03:32.579> was<00:03:33.180> inspired<00:03:34.139> by

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
but this episode was inspired by

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.550 
but this episode was inspired by
somebody<00:03:35.190> who<00:03:35.370> commented<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.090> they<00:03:37.019> really

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
somebody who commented that they really

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500 
somebody who commented that they really
liked<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.920> feature<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.610> galaxy<00:03:39.060> s3<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
liked this feature on the galaxy s3 and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720 
liked this feature on the galaxy s3 and
they<00:03:39.840> had<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.680> hard<00:03:40.950> time<00:03:41.040> finding<00:03:41.459> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
they had a really hard time finding it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.370 
they had a really hard time finding it
even<00:03:42.330> tried

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
even tried

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.620 
even tried
even<00:03:43.590> called<00:03:43.890> Samsung<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.790> didn't<00:03:45.300> even<00:03:45.420> know

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
even called Samsung and didn't even know

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.020 
even called Samsung and didn't even know
how<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.800> he<00:03:47.160> told<00:03:47.400> me<00:03:47.490> about<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
how to do it so he told me about it and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.520 
how to do it so he told me about it and
I<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.570> great<00:03:48.750> feature<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.230> it

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
I think it's a great feature I have it

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.680 
I think it's a great feature I have it
on<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:50.310> think<00:03:50.520> would<00:03:50.640> be<00:03:50.760> great<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.270> music

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
on and I think would be great for music

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.130 
on and I think would be great for music
and<00:03:52.310> oh<00:03:53.310> one<00:03:53.880> thing<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.330> when<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.690> answer<00:03:55.110> a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
and oh one thing is when you answer a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.190 
and oh one thing is when you answer a
phone<00:03:55.500> call<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:56.100> by<00:03:56.640> voice<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.210> automatically

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
phone call a by voice it automatically

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.080 
phone call a by voice it automatically
turns<00:03:58.440> off<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.770> speaker<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.760> that's

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
turns off the speaker so I think that's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.250 
turns off the speaker so I think that's
very<00:04:00.180> intuitive<00:04:00.830> so<00:04:01.830> anyway<00:04:02.130> um<00:04:02.960> there<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:03.990> go

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
very intuitive so anyway um there you go

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.220 
very intuitive so anyway um there you go
I<00:04:04.680> wanted<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.490> show<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.730> how<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> turn<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.900> on

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
I wanted to show you how to turn it on

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.870 
I wanted to show you how to turn it on
or<00:04:07.290> maybe<00:04:07.710> you<00:04:07.920> want<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.160> turn<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.460> off<00:04:08.610> save

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
or maybe you want to turn it off save

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.970 
or maybe you want to turn it off save
some<00:04:09.060> battery<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.410> get<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.860> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
some battery and how to get to it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.400 
some battery and how to get to it
because<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.640> not<00:04:11.880> obvious<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.900> cannot<00:04:13.230> go

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
because it is not obvious you cannot go

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.070 
because it is not obvious you cannot go
to<00:04:13.440> settings<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.970> not<00:04:15.240> anywhere<00:04:15.900> in

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
to settings and it is not anywhere in

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.220 
to settings and it is not anywhere in
here<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.600> it's<00:04:18.600> definitely<00:04:18.840> worth

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
here so I think it's definitely worth

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.740 
here so I think it's definitely worth
pointing<00:04:19.770> out<00:04:19.890> okay<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:20.670> if<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.390> haven't<00:04:21.540> been
