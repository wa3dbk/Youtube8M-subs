00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.740 
because if you use old loose ones
they're<00:02:00.399> going<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.790> fall<00:02:01.030> out<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.570> braid

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
they're going to fall out and the braid

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.139 
they're going to fall out and the braid
will<00:02:01.899> ultimately<00:02:02.350> unravel<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.490> stick<00:02:03.909> with<00:02:03.940> a

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
will ultimately unravel so stick with a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.730 
will ultimately unravel so stick with a
nice<00:02:04.360> tight<00:02:04.630> one<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.259> your<00:02:05.409> braid<00:02:05.590> will

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
nice tight one so that your braid will

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.790 
nice tight one so that your braid will
be<00:02:05.830> nice<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.250> secure<00:02:07.319> when<00:02:08.319> you're<00:02:08.440> done<00:02:08.590> your

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
be nice and secure when you're done your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.109 
be nice and secure when you're done your
knotted<00:02:09.069> waterfall<00:02:09.489> braid<00:02:09.729> should<00:02:09.940> look

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
knotted waterfall braid should look

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.430 
knotted waterfall braid should look
something<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.319> can

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
something like this and you can

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.810 
something like this and you can
definitely<00:02:11.890> leave<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> alone<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.640> what<00:02:12.760> I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
definitely leave it alone but what I

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.699 
definitely leave it alone but what I
like<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.630> like<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.810> tug<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
like to do is I like to tug on it and

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.540 
like to do is I like to tug on it and
pull<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.730> create<00:02:15.910> some<00:02:16.239> volume

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550
