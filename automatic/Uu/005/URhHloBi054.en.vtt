important to play together you can't
play<00:00:50.170> sort<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.260> by<00:00:51.440> yourself

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.569 

and<00:00:58.719> expect<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.620> last<00:00:59.860> for<00:01:00.100> very<00:01:00.129> long<00:01:00.309> you

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.810 

so<00:01:06.940> one<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.299> things<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:08.520> people<00:01:09.520> really

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
so one of the things is people really

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.740 
so one of the things is people really
need<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.090> know<00:01:10.210> where<00:01:10.390> you're<00:01:10.540> looking

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
need to know where you're looking

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.120

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
because that's also where you're

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.990 
because that's also where you're
shooting<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.479> have<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.630> flashlight<00:01:14.020> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
shooting so you have a flashlight and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.249 
shooting so you have a flashlight and
you<00:01:16.000> can<00:01:16.149> tell<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> lot<00:01:16.450> about<00:01:16.659> what<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.140> other

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
you can tell a lot about what the other

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:27.330 
you can tell a lot about what the other
players<00:01:17.560> are<00:01:17.890> doing<00:01:17.979> by<00:01:18.720> boomer<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:26.340> got

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
players are doing by boomer I got

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
players are doing by boomer I got
another<00:01:28.500> way

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610 

go<00:01:32.490> ahead

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.340 

ok

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:50.510 

okay<00:01:39.040> fall<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> hole

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:05.560 

so<00:01:51.520> that's<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.820> smoker

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:32.700 

who

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.350 

so<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.040> an<00:02:34.160> urban<00:02:34.550> environment<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.210> you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
so this is an urban environment that you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.450 
so this is an urban environment that you
play<00:02:35.570> through<00:02:35.870> our<00:02:36.470> goal<00:02:36.740> right<00:02:37.040> now<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
play through our goal right now is to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.020 
play through our goal right now is to

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
get get to a hospital and then at the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.050 
get get to a hospital and then at the
top<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.570> hospital<00:02:42.140> there's<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.070> rescue

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
top of the hospital there's a rescue

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.830 
top of the hospital there's a rescue
helicopter<00:02:44.210> that<00:02:44.810> will<00:02:44.900> take<00:02:45.140> us<00:02:45.290> away<00:02:46.840> but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
helicopter that will take us away but

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.030 
helicopter that will take us away but
then<00:02:47.960> of<00:02:48.080> course<00:02:48.290> since<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> horror

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
then of course since this is a horror

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.900 
then of course since this is a horror
movie<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.580> helicopter<00:02:50.060> crashes

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.070 

patients<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> street

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:04:01.630 

this<00:03:06.080> way<00:03:06.320> people

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.449 

so<00:04:02.640> if<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.819> play<00:04:03.360> as<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> team<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.800> much

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
so if you play as a team you can do much

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.089 
so if you play as a team you can do much
much<00:04:05.670> better<00:04:05.940> than<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.510> try<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.440> freelance

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
much better than if you try to freelance

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:22.820 
much better than if you try to freelance
so<00:04:11.099> here's<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.459> safe<00:04:11.670> house

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.080 

so<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:23.920> get<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.070> bunch<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.370> information<00:04:24.700> this

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
so you get a bunch of information this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.450 
so you get a bunch of information this
is<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.300> small<00:04:25.710> percentage<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.889> information

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
is a small percentage of the information

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.100 
is a small percentage of the information
that<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.790> director<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.389> actually<00:04:28.750> gathering

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
that the director is actually gathering

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.430 
that the director is actually gathering
but<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.919> uses<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.840> make<00:04:31.840> decisions<00:04:32.320> about

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
but it uses that to make decisions about

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.870 
but it uses that to make decisions about
us<00:04:32.740> like<00:04:33.160> our<00:04:33.669> experienced<00:04:34.330> are<00:04:34.510> we<00:04:35.700> how<00:04:36.700> much

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
us like our experienced are we how much

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.740 
us like our experienced are we how much
it<00:04:37.810> can<00:04:37.990> throw<00:04:38.200> at<00:04:38.290> us<00:04:38.320> in<00:04:38.560> subsequent<00:04:39.750> attacks

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
it can throw at us in subsequent attacks

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.200 
it can throw at us in subsequent attacks
etc<00:04:43.860> personally<00:04:44.860> there's<00:04:45.790> no<00:04:46.000> real

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
etc personally there's no real

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.610 
etc personally there's no real
difference<00:04:46.389> between<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> four<00:04:47.169> characters

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
difference between the four characters

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.040 
difference between the four characters
the<00:04:48.240> differences<00:04:49.240> are<00:04:49.389> in<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.630> weapons<00:04:49.930> you

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the differences are in the weapons you

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.580 
the differences are in the weapons you
select<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.710> equipment<00:04:51.520> that<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.730> have

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
select and the equipment that you have

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.810 
select and the equipment that you have
I've<00:04:53.590> found<00:04:53.830> though<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.220> when<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.370> play<00:04:54.640> is

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
I've found though that when I play is

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.450 
I've found though that when I play is
Zoe<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.390> girl<00:04:55.650> everybody<00:04:56.650> else<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:56.950> healing

Zoe the girl everybody else is healing

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.640 
Zoe the girl everybody else is healing
me<00:04:57.610> more<00:04:57.820> often<00:04:58.000> so<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.900> tend<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.200> like<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.410> play

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
me more often so I tend to like to play

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.740 
me more often so I tend to like to play
a<00:04:59.680> Zoe<00:05:00.010> because<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.550> stay<00:05:00.970> alive<00:05:01.210> longer<00:05:01.480> than

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
a Zoe because I stay alive longer than

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.470 
a Zoe because I stay alive longer than
that<00:05:04.980> making<00:05:05.980> making<00:05:06.280> sexism<00:05:06.880> work<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.390> your
