00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
after the second shot but I i understand

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.979 
after the second shot but I i understand
it<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.180> does<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.480> some<00:03:21.690> hit<00:03:21.870> detection

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989
