done project management this analogy
will<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.800> familiar<00:00:38.059> there's<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
will be familiar there's kind of a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
will be familiar there's kind of a
quadrant<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> need<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
quadrant you need to think about not a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.959 
quadrant you need to think about not a
quadrant<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.760> triangle<00:00:42.980> quad<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.399> triangle

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
quadrant a triangle quad is for triangle

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
quadrant a triangle quad is for triangle
sir<00:00:45.120> okay<00:00:45.450> good

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
sir okay good

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.720 
sir okay good
and<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.780> price<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and it's to do with the price the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.299 
and it's to do with the price the
stability<00:00:51.449> rigidity<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:53.039> lightweight

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stability rigidity and how lightweight

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.500 
stability rigidity and how lightweight
it<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> generally<00:00:55.070> they<00:00:56.070> work<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it is and generally they work in kind of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
it is and generally they work in kind of
in<00:00:57.660> tandem<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.010> super

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
in tandem so if you want it to be super

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
in tandem so if you want it to be super
rigid<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.840> don't<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> cost

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
rigid but then you don't want it to cost

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
rigid but then you don't want it to cost
too<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
too much then you're going to need to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.100 
too much then you're going to need to
use<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.229> heavier<00:01:05.060> material<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
use a heavier material if you want it to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
use a heavier material if you want it to
be<00:01:07.200> lightweight<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.830> cheap<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.369> you're

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
be lightweight and cheap then you're

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
be lightweight and cheap then you're
probably<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> sacrifice<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.780> stability

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
probably going to sacrifice on stability

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.969 
probably going to sacrifice on stability
and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.610> forth<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.750> how<00:01:13.590> all

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and so on and so forth this one how all

the ghettos in the carbon fiber range or

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
the ghettos in the carbon fiber range or
all<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.790> skimp<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.240> quality

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
all of them don't skimp on quality

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
all of them don't skimp on quality
they're<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> the

they're like really one of the
top-of-the-line<00:01:20.880> brands<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> want

to say one of the three that you're

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
to say one of the three that you're
sacrificing<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> price<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

nice and easily

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.100 
nice and easily
of<00:05:10.980> course<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.700> legs<00:05:11.910> are<00:05:12.240> adjustable<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.080> you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
of course the legs are adjustable so you

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.070 
of course the legs are adjustable so you
can<00:05:13.230> choose<00:05:13.710> what<00:05:13.950> position<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.550> want<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.850> be

latching<00:05:16.080> them<00:05:16.230> out<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:18.000> comes<00:05:18.270> with

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
latching them out to so it comes with

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
latching them out to so it comes with
three<00:05:19.050> steps<00:05:19.650> on<00:05:19.980> there<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.900> can<00:05:22.050> take<00:05:22.320> it

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
three steps on there you can take it

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.040 
three steps on there you can take it
down<00:05:23.150> further<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.390> further<00:05:24.890> out<00:05:25.890> to<00:05:26.360> level<00:05:27.360> so

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
down further and further out to level so

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.810 
down further and further out to level so
you<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.590> get<00:05:28.800> right<00:05:28.980> down<00:05:29.190> onto<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.580> ground

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
you can get right down onto the ground

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820 
you can get right down onto the ground
with<00:05:30.120> it<00:05:30.240> which<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.390> cool<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.930> on<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.470> bottom

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
with it which is cool and on the bottom

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.140 
with it which is cool and on the bottom
it<00:05:32.720> mentions<00:05:33.720> made<00:05:33.960> in<00:05:34.110> Italy<00:05:34.550> it's<00:05:35.550> got<00:05:36.000> the
