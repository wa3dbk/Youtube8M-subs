Xbox<00:00:18.300> 360<00:00:19.020> controller<00:00:19.500> charger<00:00:20.070> base<00:00:20.689> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
Xbox 360 controller charger base I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.929 
Xbox 360 controller charger base I
bought<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:22.740> Gamestop<00:00:23.279> used<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.529> $18<00:00:25.939> new

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
bought it from Gamestop used for $18 new

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
bought it from Gamestop used for $18 new
it's<00:00:27.269> 30<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:29.789> reason<00:00:30.150> why<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.720> only<00:00:30.960> 17<00:00:31.529> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it's 30 the reason why it was only 17 is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.700 
it's 30 the reason why it was only 17 is
because<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> charger

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because as you can see the the charger

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
because as you can see the the charger
base<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.130> black<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.920> only<00:00:38.129> came<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:39.170> one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
base is black and it only came with one

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.400 
base is black and it only came with one
battery<00:00:40.469> pack<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.840> only<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> saved

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
battery pack so I would only have saved

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.979 
battery pack so I would only have saved
$3<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.219> came<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.610> both<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
$3 if it came with both of them so it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
$3 if it came with both of them so it
did<00:00:46.140> come<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> used<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.700> since<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
did come with one used one and since I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
did come with one used one and since I
do<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.050> controllers<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.649> did<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
actually good because they can tell the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.910 
actually good because they can tell the
difference<00:00:54.629> between<00:00:55.110> me<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.620> brothers

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
brand-new.i that I said was $30 but I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
brand-new.i that I said was $30 but I
actually<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.020> 18<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> know

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
actually got it for 18 because you know

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.850 
actually got it for 18 because you know
I<00:01:19.979> said<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> only<00:01:20.700> had<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.000> battery<00:01:21.659> pack

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.920 

overall<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> reason<00:01:27.180> why<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> bought<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
overall the reason why I bought this is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.340 
overall the reason why I bought this is
because<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.180> would<00:01:30.329> save<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:30.869> money<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because it it would save me money on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
because it it would save me money on
batteries<00:01:31.590> instead<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.430> having<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> switch

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
batteries instead of me having to switch

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
batteries instead of me having to switch
out<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> bed<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> every<00:01:33.720> three<00:01:34.140> days<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.380> so

out of bed or you every three days or so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.190

I<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:36.119> drop<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.619> charges

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
I just drop it in here and it charges

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.410 
I just drop it in here and it charges
how<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.409> charges<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.130> there's<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.060> little

all right let me try putting it in the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.000 
all right let me try putting it in the
controller<00:02:06.770> maybe<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
controller maybe and you can see the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.190 
controller maybe and you can see the
light<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.460> shows<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.150> red<00:02:14.840> means<00:02:15.080> it's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
light actually shows up red means it's

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.890 
light actually shows up red means it's
charging<00:02:15.680> green<00:02:16.070> means<00:02:16.340> it's<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.700> fall<00:02:17.660> like

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
charging green means it's a fall like

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.250 
charging green means it's a fall like
that<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.770> when<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.150> been<00:02:20.390> green<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:20.930> a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
that and when the it's been green for a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.410 
that and when the it's been green for a
little<00:02:21.740> bit<00:02:21.890> it'll<00:02:22.550> actually<00:02:22.730> turn<00:02:23.060> off<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
little bit it'll actually turn off the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.810 
little bit it'll actually turn off the
entire<00:02:23.570> system<00:02:24.230> now<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.100> was<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.550> playing

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
entire system now I was just playing

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.480 
entire system now I was just playing
with<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.210> controller<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:28.190> should<00:02:28.460> be

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
with this controller so it should be

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.010 
with this controller so it should be
charming<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.270> shouldn't<00:02:29.510> turn<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.870> green
