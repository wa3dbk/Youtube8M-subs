00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
using the phone and I've seen a little

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.490 
using the phone and I've seen a little
bit<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.170> much

bit of that but it's not really as much

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
bit of that but it's not really as much
as<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.920> would<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.100> now<00:00:21.060> you'd<00:00:21.270> probably

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
as you would think now you'd probably

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
as you would think now you'd probably
need<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.320> huge<00:00:22.890> display<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.550> order<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.029> a

fully immersive experience but since

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
fully immersive experience but since
this<00:00:26.430> phone<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> smaller<00:00:27.630> than<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.170> 90-inch<00:00:28.710> TV

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
this phone is smaller than a 90-inch TV

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.880 
this phone is smaller than a 90-inch TV
would<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.539> phone<00:00:30.840> doesn't<00:00:31.080> provide<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
would be this phone doesn't provide the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
material for this phone and they show a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
material for this phone and they show a
very<00:00:37.920> seriously<00:00:38.760> curved<00:00:39.360> phone<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.260> of

marketing materials but in real life in
an<00:00:43.950> actuality<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:45.989> curved

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
an actuality this thing is not as curved

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.979 
an actuality this thing is not as curved
as<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.950> show<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.520> their<00:00:48.510> marketing

as they show it on their marketing
material<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.430> curve<00:00:50.730> it's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
material also because of this curve it's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
material also because of this curve it's
supposed<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> sit<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.809> hand<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.199> little

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
supposed to sit in your hand a little

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
supposed to sit in your hand a little
bit<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.800> comfortably<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.489> another<00:00:54.120> phone

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
bit more comfortably than another phone

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
bit more comfortably than another phone
would<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> does<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
would and it kind of does but when I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.069 
would and it kind of does but when I
hold<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.969> phone<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.390> usually<00:00:57.539> hold<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.050> my

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
hold my phone I usually hold it with my

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.319 
hold my phone I usually hold it with my
thumb<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.219> index<00:00:59.609> fingers<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
thumb and then my index fingers are on

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
thumb and then my index fingers are on
the<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.629> side<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:02.129> really

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the other side of it and it really

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
the other side of it and it really
doesn't<00:01:02.879> rest<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> palm<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.409> hand<00:01:04.769> as

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
doesn't rest in the palm of my hand as

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
doesn't rest in the palm of my hand as
much<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.810> I'm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
much as you would think because I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
much as you would think because I'm
really<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> holding<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> edges<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
really just holding the edges of the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.760 
really just holding the edges of the
phone<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.020> resting

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
phone and it's not really just resting

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
phone and it's not really just resting
in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.610> palm<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.060> hand<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> does<00:01:13.110> help

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in the palm of my hand but it does help

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
in the palm of my hand but it does help
just<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.830> slightly<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.490> than<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.850> straight

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
just a slightly more than a straight

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.390 
just a slightly more than a straight
phone<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.439> curious<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
phone would so I'm really curious as to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.940 
phone would so I'm really curious as to
where<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.850> technology<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:19.049> inside<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
where this technology will go inside of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
where this technology will go inside of
phones<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> could<00:01:21.240> definitely<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
phones now I could definitely see this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
phones now I could definitely see this
as<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> wearable<00:01:23.070> technology<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.390> example<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
as a wearable technology for example the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.539 
as a wearable technology for example the
iWatch<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> supposed<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.130> rumored<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
iWatch that is supposed to be rumored to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.340 
iWatch that is supposed to be rumored to
be<00:01:26.580> coming<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.210> soon<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
be coming out pretty soon here that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
be coming out pretty soon here that
would<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.829> awesome<00:01:29.040> curved<00:01:29.579> display<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
would be an awesome curved display on

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
would be an awesome curved display on
your<00:01:30.210> wrist<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.470> wrist<00:01:31.740> actually

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
your wrist because your wrist actually

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
your wrist because your wrist actually
curves<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.500> technology<00:01:34.799> would

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
curves around and that technology would

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640 
curves around and that technology would
work<00:01:35.490> perfectly<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.750> wearables<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.560> right

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
work perfectly for wearables but right

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.679 
work perfectly for wearables but right
now<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.009> stands<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.579> cell<00:01:38.820> phones<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.270> don't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
now as it stands on cell phones I don't

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.060 
now as it stands on cell phones I don't
