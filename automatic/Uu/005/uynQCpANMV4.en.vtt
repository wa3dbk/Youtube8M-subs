00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
actually evolved right after I caught it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.279

because I went there to get a can so
that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.949> evolve<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.609> our

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the world so I probably wouldn't use it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.350 
the world so I probably wouldn't use it
for<00:01:42.569> competitive<00:01:43.500> battle<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.789> you<00:01:45.299> know
