it's almost like a penny in a sense we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.270 
it's almost like a penny in a sense we
rarely<00:01:38.299> carry<00:01:38.630> pennies<00:01:39.049> in<00:01:39.200> our<00:01:39.289> pocket<00:01:39.680> even

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.660 
rarely carry pennies in our pocket even
more<00:01:40.729> scarcely<00:01:41.659> really<00:01:42.020> carry<00:01:42.259> 200<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:43.070> just

more scarcely really carry 200 I just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.370 
more scarcely really carry 200 I just
absolutely<00:01:44.210> love<00:01:44.509> them<00:01:44.719> it's<00:01:45.020> hard<00:01:45.289> to

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
absolutely love them it's hard to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.990 
absolutely love them it's hard to
explain<00:01:45.680> really<00:01:45.920> what<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.399> all<00:01:46.579> about<00:01:46.609> how

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000

much<00:01:47.359> I<00:01:47.539> love<00:01:47.719> them<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.109> kind<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.039> like<00:01:49.219> round

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
much I love them I kind of like round

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.370 
much I love them I kind of like round
numbers<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.030> think<00:01:50.149> maybe<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.750> aspect<00:01:51.170> of

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
numbers so I think maybe that aspect of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.380 
numbers so I think maybe that aspect of
it<00:01:51.500> appeals<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.890> me<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:52.759> then<00:01:52.880> also<00:01:53.060> there's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it appeals to me but then also there's

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.179 
it appeals to me but then also there's
just<00:01:53.570> fewer<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.899> them<00:01:54.020> printed<00:01:54.289> so<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:55.039> also

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
just fewer of them printed so I also

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.039 
just fewer of them printed so I also
collect<00:01:55.549> fancy<00:01:55.969> serial<00:01:56.299> numbers<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.869> when

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
collect fancy serial numbers and when

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.660 
collect fancy serial numbers and when
there's<00:01:57.229> fewer<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.560> them<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.130> $2<00:01:58.429> bill

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
there's fewer of them on the $2 bill

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.819 
there's fewer of them on the $2 bill
that<00:01:58.820> makes<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.119> even<00:01:59.240> more<00:01:59.390> special<00:01:59.770> why<00:02:00.770> do

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
that makes it even more special why do

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.000 
that makes it even more special why do
people<00:02:01.280> collect<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.820> shoes

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
people collect the shoes

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.160 
people collect the shoes
oh<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.690> series<00:02:08.380> from<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.119> 1928<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.960> me

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
oh well the series from the 1928 for me

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.290 
oh well the series from the 1928 for me
that's<00:02:11.740> when<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.220> currency<00:02:12.640> was<00:02:12.970> switched

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
that's when the currency was switched

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.410 
that's when the currency was switched
from<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.780> large-size<00:02:14.620> bills<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> smaller

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
from the large-size bills to the smaller

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.630 
from the large-size bills to the smaller
size<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.440> could<00:02:17.650> print<00:02:17.920> more<00:02:18.460> of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
size so that they could print more of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.630 
size so that they could print more of
them<00:02:18.820> at<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.360> time<00:02:20.100> that's<00:02:21.100> why<00:02:21.460> they're

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
them at one time that's why they're

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.780 
them at one time that's why they're
called<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> small<00:02:22.330> size<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.410> started

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
called the small size and that started

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.940 
called the small size and that started
1928<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.150> that's<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.110> am<00:02:26.320> lected<00:02:26.710> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
1928 and that's what I am lected to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.610 
1928 and that's what I am lected to
start<00:02:27.370> my<00:02:27.670> collections<00:02:28.210> with<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
start my collections with and with the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.240 
start my collections with and with the
1928<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:30.970> run<00:02:31.300> from<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.950> 1928<00:02:33.300> true<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.470> 1928<00:02:35.470> G

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
1928 they run from a 1928 true a 1928 G

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.140 
1928 they run from a 1928 true a 1928 G
and<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:37.210> covers<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.870> printing<00:02:38.470> from<00:02:39.150> 1928

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and that covers the printing from 1928

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.310 
and that covers the printing from 1928
through<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> believe<00:02:42.960> 1934<00:02:43.960> 36<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:46.050> as<00:02:47.050> soon<00:02:47.290> as

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
through I believe 1934 36 and as soon as

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.870 
through I believe 1934 36 and as soon as
they<00:02:47.470> would<00:02:47.620> complete<00:02:47.890> one<00:02:48.160> printing<00:02:48.640> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
they would complete one printing and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.450 
they would complete one printing and
they<00:02:49.000> decided<00:02:49.840> they<00:02:50.080> needed<00:02:50.290> more<00:02:50.710> than<00:02:50.980> they

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
they decided they needed more than they

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.860 
they decided they needed more than they
would<00:02:51.580> make<00:02:51.760> another<00:02:52.090> printing<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.540> they'd<00:02:52.720> go

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
would make another printing so they'd go

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.150 
would make another printing so they'd go
from<00:02:53.020> 1928<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:54.209> 1928<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.959> then<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.010> they

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
from 1928 to 1928 a and then when they

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.710 
from 1928 to 1928 a and then when they
were<00:02:57.220> running<00:02:57.580> out<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> A's<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.630> they

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
were running out of the A's and they

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.690 
were running out of the A's and they
wanted<00:02:59.050> more<00:02:59.260> they<00:02:59.560> made<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.950> bees<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
wanted more they made the bees and

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.650 
wanted more they made the bees and
obviously<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> printing<00:03:02.260> runs<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.740> each<00:03:02.950> sets

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
obviously the printing runs of each sets

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.110 
obviously the printing runs of each sets
varied<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.080> some<00:03:05.470> are<00:03:05.500> more<00:03:06.459> valuable<00:03:06.880> than

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
varied so some are more valuable than

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420 
varied so some are more valuable than
others<00:03:07.239> because<00:03:07.989> there<00:03:08.770> were<00:03:08.920> fewer<00:03:09.190> them

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
others because there were fewer them

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.000 
others because there were fewer them
printed<00:03:09.880> such<00:03:10.570> as<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> case<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.320> 1928

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
printed such as in the case the 1928

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.770 
printed such as in the case the 1928
bees<00:03:12.480> they're<00:03:13.480> very<00:03:13.810> rare<00:03:14.140> especially
