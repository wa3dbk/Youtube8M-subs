00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.770
 hi guys today that we were introduced to 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.460
 doll 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.549
 Rapunzel you will be able to stretch the hair 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.129
 the hair we are going to show you in a moment 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.500
 what they could do with it a hand 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.230
 to entertain or again I'm 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 taking out all the equipment tetra the box 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.130
 we have here the doll that is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.130
 beautiful as you can see 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.520
 we go 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 it's very easy guys do not worry no 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 I will need neither dad nor mom 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 and the play dough 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 and some accessories that carry to cut 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.179
 and shape the braids 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.179
 light 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.590
 let's start with the hair 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.560
 we molded the clay a little bit because 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.409
 as you will understand, it is a bit hard 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.310
 we put it in the hollow of the head 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.310
 we put the crown 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.820
 if we throw we have the crank a little bit 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.820
 you see how it's going 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.299
 when you do that clip is that it does not come out 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.409
 more if you want to make it longer you have 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 to put more plasticine 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.140
 let's model well you 'll see 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.310
 you what I'm stopping now 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 you will tell me 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.520
 with this instrument in the form of 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.520
 frog that we have done 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.840
 you think they are shaped like 30 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 we are cutting the rest 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.240
 let's continue 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 let's see if it 's what I want to do 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.270
 it's very simple as you can see it's not 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.270
 nothing complicated 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.950
 I'm not fine either if it's a tie 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 scissors 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.689
 what do you think 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.239
 we hooked on the braid 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 or surprise we have engaged in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.350
 head that braids longer has left 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.350
 to rapunzel 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.850
 now we take clay from another color 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 I'm shaping it with the molds that 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.670
 there are in the same base of the wrist 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.250
 look at a pretty flower 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.250
 where are we going to put that flower 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.920
 as always removing the remaining 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 and now 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.069
 a star 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.440
 arrived so you can do it from 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.430
 another way if we like it or the star 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.290
 has finished in her bangs and the flower 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.290
 over the braid where it starts 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.570
 to see what I'm going to do now with 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.570
 these little balls 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.569
 I'm not making pellets huh 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.899
 let's make a small base 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.189
 always with removing what is left over or what 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.189
 remaining 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.520
 good still more 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.220
 we do not make more finite 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:38.339
 without children I think that that will be the basis 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.339
 of the necklace 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.590
 and now we put the balls as if 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.590
 they were pearls 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.080
 we combine different colors 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.430
 as you can see in the same base of the 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.080
 same foot wrist 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.500
 you have different molds to be able 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.500
 use 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.630
 we are marking a ruby where it will go from 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.630
 that ruby shape 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.870
 to highlight the loop 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.240
 and now I think we're going to do the touch 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.240
 final 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.450
 and the jewel in the crown 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.530
 we put everything well we pick it up and so 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.090
 stayed myrrh ponce hope you like it 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.960
 good guys see you next time 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.960
 goodbye
