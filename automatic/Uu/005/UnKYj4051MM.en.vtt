00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.500
 as under the past video clips 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 there were more than 5 likes, even almost 10 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 then I will keep my promise and teach you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 do here such karambit looked 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 He's cool , see for yourself in general 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 let's go first we need to cut this a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.539
 Now I will explain everything on the table 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 now you will understand what I am after 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.940
 how we cut the whole thing we need 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 glue it after we glue it together 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 all figures 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 we need to make one single figure then 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.469
 there is kerambit here that is this model 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 the most karambit of 15 pieces this one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.500
 the model we have here is 9 such a thing 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 such a model to apply here and so and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.860
 glue and then another model with 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.960
 the other side we must also glue 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.290
 here and then on here these models right now show 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 eerily what will happen on the one hand 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 here it is this model we must still 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.520
 attach it here 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.259
 karambit you and then you can paint 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
 his varnishes as you like 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 Well, more on that later, but now weâ€™ve gone 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 glue it all and after we 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.890
 all stuck together we get this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.649
 the figure is just stupid white kerambit but 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.759
