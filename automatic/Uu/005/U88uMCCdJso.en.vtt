00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
about for all and then I kind of climbed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.580 
about for all and then I kind of climbed
a<00:01:40.619> break<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:41.960> he<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.140> played<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> bad<00:01:43.560> game

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and then I was able to free up a little

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
and then I was able to free up a little
bit<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> started<00:01:45.960> playing<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.380> bit

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.460 
to have to learn some of the subtleties
in<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:04.190> game<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.660> know<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.840> those<00:03:06.320> are

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
so you know between him and Ryan I think

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.600 
so you know between him and Ryan I think
I<00:03:11.480> think<00:03:11.720> we've<00:03:11.840> got<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.019> couple<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.610> legit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
I think we've got a couple of legit

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.250 
I think we've got a couple of legit
prospects<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.900> said<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.140> other

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
prospects and like I said the other

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.360 
prospects and like I said the other
night<00:03:15.290> my<00:03:15.530> favorite<00:03:15.829> thing<00:03:15.950> about<00:03:16.010> him<00:03:16.280> is

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
night my favorite thing about him is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.370 
night my favorite thing about him is
that<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:16.640> compete<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.570> know<00:03:17.600> they<00:03:17.810> really

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
together pretty much every day from from

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.640

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
that probably three four months when I

first game did you sense something

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.860 
first game did you sense something
different

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
different

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.750 
different
and<00:05:57.960> in<00:05:58.350> what<00:05:58.680> was<00:05:58.830> kind<00:05:58.950> of<00:05:59.040> your<00:05:59.190> process<00:05:59.640> of

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
and in what was kind of your process of

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.240 
and in what was kind of your process of
feeling<00:06:00.210> out<00:06:00.360> his<00:06:00.720> level<00:06:01.140> of<00:06:01.260> confidence<00:06:02.010> or

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
feeling out his level of confidence or

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.060 
feeling out his level of confidence or
anxiety<00:06:03.380> how<00:06:04.380> did<00:06:04.530> that<00:06:04.650> him<00:06:04.800> there's<00:06:05.700> a

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
anxiety how did that him there's a

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.360 
anxiety how did that him there's a
player's<00:06:08.070> uh<00:06:09.470> of<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.590> certain<00:06:10.860> ranking<00:06:11.220> who

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
player's uh of a certain ranking who

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.400 
player's uh of a certain ranking who
haven't<00:06:11.640> been<00:06:11.670> on<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:11.940> court<00:06:12.240> before<00:06:12.410> come

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
haven't been on that court before come

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.610 
haven't been on that court before come
out<00:06:15.290> above<00:06:16.290> themselves<00:06:16.530> or<00:06:18.230> not<00:06:19.230> being<00:06:19.440> able

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
out above themselves or not being able

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.070 
out above themselves or not being able
to<00:06:19.770> hit<00:06:20.400> much<00:06:20.610> of<00:06:20.760> a<00:06:20.820> ball<00:06:21.000> he<00:06:21.420> came<00:06:21.630> out<00:06:21.780> and

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
to hit much of a ball he came out and

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.760 
to hit much of a ball he came out and
had<00:06:22.500> red<00:06:22.710> points<00:06:23.040> early<00:06:24.050> he<00:06:25.050> wins<00:06:25.230> those<00:06:25.470> it's

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
had red points early he wins those it's

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.590 
had red points early he wins those it's
a<00:06:26.010> I<00:06:26.460> think<00:06:26.670> it's<00:06:26.790> a<00:06:26.850> different<00:06:27.150> dynamic<00:06:27.240> and

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
a I think it's a different dynamic and

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.090 
a I think it's a different dynamic and
that<00:06:27.690> set<00:06:28.020> I<00:06:28.200> was<00:06:28.290> able<00:06:28.560> to<00:06:28.590> fight<00:06:28.830> them<00:06:28.980> off

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
that set I was able to fight them off

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.520 
that set I was able to fight them off
yet<00:06:29.390> one<00:06:30.390> really<00:06:30.750> good<00:06:30.870> look<00:06:31.050> at<00:06:31.170> a<00:06:31.200> forehand

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
yet one really good look at a forehand

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.910 
yet one really good look at a forehand
and<00:06:31.710> he<00:06:31.770> missed<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:32.040> he<00:06:32.190> took<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.370> swing<00:06:32.670> at<00:06:32.760> it

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
and he missed it he took a swing at it

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.900 
and he missed it he took a swing at it
those<00:06:34.920> are<00:06:35.100> the<00:06:35.160> little<00:06:35.340> subtleties<00:06:35.880> in

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
those are the little subtleties in

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.730 
those are the little subtleties in
tennis<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.540> you<00:06:36.900> know<00:06:37.020> we<00:06:37.200> could<00:06:37.350> we<00:06:37.620> could

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
tennis that you know we could we could

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.420 
tennis that you know we could we could
still<00:06:37.980> be<00:06:38.010> out<00:06:38.190> there

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
still be out there

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.070 
still be out there
it<00:06:38.700> might<00:06:39.360> have<00:06:39.450> been<00:06:39.480> a<00:06:39.570> little<00:06:39.780> bit<00:06:39.900> more<00:06:39.930> of

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
it might have been a little bit more of

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.590 
it might have been a little bit more of
an<00:06:40.170> uphill<00:06:40.380> battle<00:06:40.460> but<00:06:41.460> then<00:06:41.670> you<00:06:41.850> get<00:06:41.970> to<00:06:42.030> two

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
an uphill battle but then you get to two

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.880 
an uphill battle but then you get to two
all<00:06:42.780> three<00:06:42.810> all<00:06:43.140> and<00:06:43.290> all<00:06:43.380> of<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.560> sudden<00:06:43.590> it

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
all three all and all of a sudden it

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.440 
all three all and all of a sudden it
becomes<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.220> real<00:06:44.370> scenario<00:06:44.730> as<00:06:44.970> opposed<00:06:45.300> to

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
becomes a real scenario as opposed to

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.210 
becomes a real scenario as opposed to
you<00:06:46.260> know<00:06:46.290> this<00:06:46.500> thing<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.770> you<00:06:46.890> just<00:06:46.920> hyped

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
you know this thing that you just hyped

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.690 
you know this thing that you just hyped
out<00:06:47.370> of<00:06:47.490> here<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:48.150> know<00:06:48.500> whatever<00:06:49.500> so<00:06:49.740> you

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
out of here you know whatever so you

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.460 
out of here you know whatever so you
know<00:06:50.790> after<00:06:51.000> I<00:06:51.210> think<00:06:51.630> after<00:06:51.780> those

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
know after I think after those

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.220 
know after I think after those
breakpoints<00:06:52.950> went<00:06:53.100> by<00:06:53.190> it<00:06:53.250> became<00:06:53.670> real<00:06:54.230> real

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
breakpoints went by it became real real

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.500 
breakpoints went by it became real real
