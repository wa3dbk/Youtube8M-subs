so when's it come in just muck around
with<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.790> layers<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.420> trying<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.750> find

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
with the layers just to trying to find

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.550 
with the layers just to trying to find
that<00:02:39.230> had<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.790> do<00:02:41.330> figure<00:02:41.900> out<00:02:42.200> in

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
that had it and then I do figure out in

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.970 
that had it and then I do figure out in
a<00:02:42.709> minute<00:02:42.890> yeah<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:43.910> go<00:02:44.260> go<00:02:45.260> down<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
a minute yeah there we go go down you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.259 
a minute yeah there we go go down you
what<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.220> want<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.519> some<00:02:46.730> delete<00:02:47.030> all<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
what you want to do some delete all the

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.900 
what you want to do some delete all the
layers<00:02:51.010> make<00:02:52.010> sure<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.250> can<00:02:52.430> buy<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> car

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
layers make sure you can buy a car

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.490 
layers make sure you can buy a car
what's<00:02:53.120> not<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.300> lot<00:02:53.660> design<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:57.140> once<00:02:57.350> you've

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
what's not a lot design then once you've

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.520 
what's not a lot design then once you've
deleted<00:02:57.709> all<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:57.980> layers<00:02:59.110> you<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.350> put<00:03:00.500> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
deleted all the layers you have to put a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.069 
deleted all the layers you have to put a
special<00:03:01.040> design<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.060> what<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.690> was<00:03:02.930> looking

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
special design on it what I was looking

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.180 
special design on it what I was looking
for<00:03:03.290> um<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.970> put<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> wrong<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:05.989> there

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
for um I put the wrong one on there

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.509 
for um I put the wrong one on there
because<00:03:07.190> i<00:03:07.370> forgot<00:03:07.579> where<00:03:07.880> I'll<00:03:07.970> say<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.209> did

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
because i forgot where I'll say you did

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.800 
because i forgot where I'll say you did
and<00:03:10.519> then<00:03:10.790> I'm<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.150> trying<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.450> figure<00:03:11.690> out

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
and then I'm just trying to figure out

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.410 
and then I'm just trying to figure out
where<00:03:12.170> whoever<00:03:12.470> put<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.100> design<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.850> you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
where whoever put this design what you

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.650 
where whoever put this design what you
want<00:03:14.660> what<00:03:14.870> you'll<00:03:15.200> get<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:17.299> have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
want what you'll get when you have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.590 
want what you'll get when you have
subscribed<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.320> my<00:03:18.440> channel<00:03:18.610> because<00:03:19.610> this

subscribed to my channel because this
one<00:03:20.810> makes<00:03:20.989> design<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:21.680> once<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.190> subscribe

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
one makes design then once you subscribe

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.300 
one makes design then once you subscribe
to<00:03:22.670> our<00:03:22.910> channel<00:03:23.209> I'm<00:03:23.680> send<00:03:24.680> me<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.769> message<00:03:25.040> now

to our channel I'm send me a message now
give<00:03:25.579> you<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> design<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.130> delete<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.579> and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
give you the design so I delete that and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.819 
give you the design so I delete that and
then<00:03:29.120> I'll<00:03:29.269> know<00:03:29.930> where<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.410> are<00:03:30.620> going
