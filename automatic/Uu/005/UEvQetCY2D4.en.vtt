00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.350 
right side before I turned it in I made
little<00:02:38.780> cuts<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.730> could<00:02:41.880> see<00:02:42.000> them<00:02:42.150> over

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
little cuts and you could see them over

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.300 
little cuts and you could see them over
here<00:02:44.330> see<00:02:45.330> these<00:02:45.450> little<00:02:45.630> pieces<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.500> made

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
here see these little pieces here I made

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.030 
here see these little pieces here I made
little<00:02:47.489> cuts<00:02:47.850> into<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.810> around<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.709> curves

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
little cuts into the around the curves

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.300 
little cuts into the around the curves
so<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.970> material<00:02:51.540> flows<00:02:51.980> around<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so that the material flows around the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.250 
so that the material flows around the
curves<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.180> then<00:02:54.330> when<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> turn<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> inside

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
curves so then when you turn it inside

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.830 
curves so then when you turn it inside
out<00:02:55.290> you're<00:02:56.190> able<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.550> get<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> nice<00:02:57.270> smooth

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
out you're able to get a nice smooth

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520 
out you're able to get a nice smooth
edge<00:02:58.520> okay<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.180> what<00:03:00.600> I'm<00:03:00.720> doing<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
