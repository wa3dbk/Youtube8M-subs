it was way warm and I was starting to

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.050 
it was way warm and I was starting to
front<00:03:42.660> pack<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.140> knew<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.739> had

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
front pack so I knew that I had

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.550 
front pack so I knew that I had
opportunity<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.510> get<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> front<00:03:45.080> there's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
opportunity to get to the front there's

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.839 
opportunity to get to the front there's
a<00:03:45.620> lot<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.800> kennel<00:03:46.069> cough<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.340> different

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
viruses and and I probably and I

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.110 
viruses and and I probably and I
probably<00:03:51.830> ran<00:03:52.099> in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> heat<00:03:52.550> more<00:03:52.819> than<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
probably ran in the heat more than I
