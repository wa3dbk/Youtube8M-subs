and as you can see we've dialed down the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.080 
and as you can see we've dialed down the

thermocouple is obsolete they no longer
manufacture<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.090> because<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
manufacture it because it is a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.760 
manufacture it because it is a

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.100 

and<00:01:22.220> what<00:01:22.549> they<00:01:22.759> do<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.450> they<00:01:23.630> sell<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.079> a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
and what they do is they sell you a

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.520 
and what they do is they sell you a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the new thermocouple were told is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.400 
the new thermocouple were told is
right-handed

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
right-handed

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.290 
right-handed
we<00:01:43.410> checked<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.950> local<00:01:44.400> company<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> see

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
we checked with a local company to see

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.360 
we checked with a local company to see
if<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:46.050> thermocouple<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.860> still<00:01:47.130> available

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
if the thermocouple was still available

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.520 
if the thermocouple was still available
and<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:51.300> couldn't<00:01:51.570> find<00:01:51.900> any<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.350> their

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
and we couldn't find any on their
website<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:55.410> what<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.770> did<00:01:57.440> we<00:01:58.440> ordered<00:01:58.980> the

conversion kit you can see the part
number<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:14.840> we've<00:02:15.840> already<00:02:16.140> cut<00:02:16.980> open

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
number there and we've already cut open

see the shipping container has no
packing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.120 

we<00:02:29.940> found<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> little<00:02:30.810> unusual

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.089 

even<00:02:35.130> weird

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.910 

and<00:02:42.569> let's<00:02:43.569> see<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
and let's see do we have the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.649 
and let's see do we have the
thermocouple<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.959> box<00:02:51.629> we<00:02:52.629> have

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
thermocouple and the box we have

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.750 
thermocouple and the box we have
something<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.560> looks<00:02:53.739> like<00:02:53.889> a<00:02:54.040> connector

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
something that looks like a connector

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.559 
something that looks like a connector
for<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:55.239> thermocouple

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.620 

and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.690 

I'm<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.470> seeing<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.660 

so<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:13.470> may<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.130> here<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.599> know<00:03:15.780> as

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
so this may be it here I do not know as

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.449 
so this may be it here I do not know as
you<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.700> see<00:03:18.349> it's<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:19.530> rather<00:03:19.680> fragile

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
you can see it's a rather fragile

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.130 
you can see it's a rather fragile
looking<00:03:20.580> ceramic<00:03:21.420> part<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.930> there's<00:03:24.930> at

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
looking ceramic part and there's at

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.120 
looking ceramic part and there's at
least<00:03:25.170> one<00:03:25.650> other<00:03:25.800> ceramic<00:03:26.459> part<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
least one other ceramic part on the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.770 
least one other ceramic part on the
device

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.510 

and<00:03:32.900> we're<00:03:33.380> not<00:03:33.530> finding<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.190> at<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.550> moment

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.920 

there<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.480> are<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:44.550> they<00:03:44.940> ship<00:03:45.210> this<00:03:45.450> without

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
there we are and they ship this without

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.280 
there we are and they ship this without
any<00:03:46.260> packing<00:03:49.850> we<00:03:50.850> thought<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.330> was<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.810> little

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
any packing we thought that was a little

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.590 
any packing we thought that was a little
unusual<00:03:52.500> maybe<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.550> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> thermocouple

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
unusual maybe this is the thermocouple

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.360 
unusual maybe this is the thermocouple
connection<00:03:55.230> here<00:04:00.620> we<00:04:01.620> called<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.130> local

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
connection here we called a local

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.940 
connection here we called a local
service<00:04:03.060> company<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:06.420> see<00:04:06.720> if<00:04:07.050> they<00:04:07.380> could<00:04:07.440> do

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
service company to see if they could do

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
service company to see if they could do
the<00:04:08.340> conversion<00:04:09.000> job<00:04:09.270> for<00:04:09.720> us<00:04:10.910> they<00:04:11.910> wanted

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the conversion job for us they wanted

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.010
