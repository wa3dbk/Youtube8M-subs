there's no loss you can actually use

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
there's no loss you can actually use
this<00:01:26.700> later<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> our<00:01:28.259> hydro<00:01:28.680> tub

here<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.579> high<00:01:35.850> pressure<00:01:36.210> water

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
here you have your high pressure water

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
here you have your high pressure water

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
reason why we have it without water so
we<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.040> show<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.280> easily<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> installs

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we can show you easily how it installs

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980 
we can show you easily how it installs
the<00:01:43.500> pump<00:01:43.799> comes<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.340> its<00:01:44.490> own<00:01:44.759> nozzle<00:01:45.479> neck

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the pump comes with its own nozzle neck

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
the pump comes with its own nozzle neck
and<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.610> very<00:01:47.610> easily<00:01:49.430> unscrews<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.909> from

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and it very easily unscrews right from

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
and it very easily unscrews right from
the<00:01:51.210> top<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> pump<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.500> goes<00:01:52.710> right

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the top of the pump and then goes right

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.370 
the top of the pump and then goes right
back<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.990> pumps<00:01:55.350> water

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
back in what that does is it pumps water

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
back in what that does is it pumps water
up<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.340> feeder<00:01:56.670> tube<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.630> then

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
up into this feeder tube which then

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
up into this feeder tube which then
feeds<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.409> drip<00:01:58.649> emitters<00:01:58.829> those<00:01:59.700> drip

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
feeds the drip emitters those drip

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
feeds the drip emitters those drip
emitter<00:02:00.180> 'he's<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.960> turn<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.439> when<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> have

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
emitter 'he's will turn on when you have

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.069 
emitter 'he's will turn on when you have
