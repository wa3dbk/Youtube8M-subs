all<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.149> fun<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.600> is<00:01:01.719> left<00:01:01.959> in<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.289> game

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
I stopped playing the game because I

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.740 
I stopped playing the game because I
didn't<00:01:04.989> find<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.530> enjoying<00:01:06.070> any<00:01:06.219> more<00:01:06.430> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
didn't find it enjoying any more and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.749 
didn't find it enjoying any more and
this<00:01:07.750> would<00:01:07.990> make<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.439> even<00:01:08.590> less<00:01:09.130> enjoying<00:01:09.579> I

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
this would make it even less enjoying I

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.459 
this would make it even less enjoying I
know<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.119> have<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.630> collector's<00:01:11.049> edition

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
know that I have the collector's edition

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.550 
know that I have the collector's edition
but<00:01:13.680> still<00:01:14.680> if<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:15.009> were<00:01:15.219> a<00:01:15.250> new<00:01:15.610> player<00:01:16.030> then<00:01:16.509> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
but still if I were a new player then I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.020 
but still if I were a new player then I
wouldn't<00:01:17.560> want<00:01:17.890> all<00:01:18.070> these<00:01:18.280> restrictions<00:01:18.759> and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
wouldn't want all these restrictions and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.529 
wouldn't want all these restrictions and
I<00:01:19.119> would<00:01:19.270> probably<00:01:19.479> play<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.829> for<00:01:21.460> maybe<00:01:22.390> an

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
I would probably play it for maybe an

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.620 
I would probably play it for maybe an
hour<00:01:22.600> or<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.409> then<00:01:23.500> just<00:01:23.770> quit<00:01:24.070> I<00:01:24.549> mean<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
hour or so and then just quit I mean the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.569 
hour or so and then just quit I mean the
story<00:01:25.899> is<00:01:25.990> good<00:01:26.259> but<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.920> side<00:01:27.100> quests<00:01:27.460> are

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
story is good but the side quests are

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.179 
story is good but the side quests are
just<00:01:27.759> annoying<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:29.500> being<00:01:29.829> able<00:01:30.009> to

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
just annoying and not being able to

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.300 
just annoying and not being able to
sprint<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.600> emergency<00:01:32.109> fleet<00:01:32.350> pass<00:01:32.710> field

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
sprint the emergency fleet pass field

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.399 
sprint the emergency fleet pass field
revised<00:01:33.820> was<00:01:34.179> a<00:01:34.210> big<00:01:34.479> one<00:01:34.689> for<00:01:34.719> me<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:38.229> bio

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409
