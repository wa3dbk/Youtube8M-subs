00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
first glimpse at a lot of concept cars

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.819 
first glimpse at a lot of concept cars
not<00:01:17.069> just<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.429> Toyota<00:01:17.819> but<00:01:17.969> from<00:01:18.179> other

show<00:01:21.240> us<00:01:21.389> some<00:01:21.569> go<00:01:22.109> through<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.560> car<00:01:22.859> one<00:01:23.100> at

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
show us some go through each car one at

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
show us some go through each car one at
a<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.759> us<00:01:23.819> so<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.569> can<00:01:24.719> go<00:01:24.990> through

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
a time for us so that we can go through

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
a time for us so that we can go through
it<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.439> screen<00:01:25.679> so<00:01:26.039> people<00:01:26.219> can<00:01:26.429> see<00:01:26.609> what<00:01:26.639> what

it on screen so people can see what what

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.330 
it on screen so people can see what what
this<00:01:27.479> car<00:01:27.719> had<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.319> this<00:01:28.499> game<00:01:28.679> actually<00:01:28.979> has

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
this car had what this game actually has

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.309 
this car had what this game actually has
car<00:01:29.700> wise<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.149> now<00:01:30.299> okay

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
car wise right now okay
