next one says for harder deep slabs
remove<00:04:22.070> skis<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.580> jump<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:22.970> same<00:04:23.240> spot

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
remove skis and jump in the same spot

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.510 
remove skis and jump in the same spot
okay<00:04:24.350> first<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.900> good<00:04:26.900> no<00:04:27.590> keep<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:28.040> finish

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
okay first so good no keep going finish

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520 
okay first so good no keep going finish
your<00:04:28.550> soft<00:04:29.120> slaps<00:04:29.450> or<00:04:29.630> thick<00:04:29.840> slabs<00:04:30.169> we're

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
your soft slaps or thick slabs we're

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.740 
your soft slaps or thick slabs we're
jumping<00:04:31.130> with<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.430> skis<00:04:31.700> might<00:04:31.910> pinch<00:04:32.540> a

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
jumping with that skis might pinch a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.260 
jumping with that skis might pinch a
through<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.200> slab<00:04:33.410> keep<00:04:33.740> skis<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.190> step<00:04:35.090> down

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
through the slab keep skis on step down

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.960 
through the slab keep skis on step down
another<00:04:35.510> 35<00:04:36.080> centimeters<00:04:36.710> almost<00:04:37.250> mid-block

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
another 35 centimeters almost mid-block

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.890 
another 35 centimeters almost mid-block
and<00:04:38.120> push<00:04:38.510> once<00:04:38.780> then<00:04:39.440> jump<00:04:39.830> three<00:04:40.130> times<00:04:40.900> okay

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
and push once then jump three times okay

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.900 
and push once then jump three times okay
so<00:04:42.260> we<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.380> pretty<00:04:42.650> detailed<00:04:43.160> instructions

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
so we have pretty detailed instructions

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.020 
so we have pretty detailed instructions
on<00:04:44.090> an<00:04:44.180> idea<00:04:44.570> yeah<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:49.370> we<00:04:49.520> had<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.850> there

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
on an idea yeah we so we had it there

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.930 
on an idea yeah we so we had it there
now<00:04:50.210> she<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:50.810> we<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.860> had<00:04:52.070> some<00:04:52.400> settling

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
now she just we just had some settling

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.450 
now she just we just had some settling
with<00:04:53.120> one<00:04:53.419> jump<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.140> if<00:04:54.470> she<00:04:54.500> offered<00:04:55.100> her<00:04:55.190> jump

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
with one jump so if she offered her jump

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.650 
with one jump so if she offered her jump
again<00:04:55.760> yes<00:04:56.270> have<00:04:57.169> her<00:04:57.320> jump<00:04:57.590> again<00:04:58.180> before<00:04:59.180> she

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
again yes have her jump again before she

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.440 
again yes have her jump again before she
actually<00:04:59.810> goes<00:05:00.710> ahead<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.190> takes<00:05:01.520> her<00:05:01.790> board
