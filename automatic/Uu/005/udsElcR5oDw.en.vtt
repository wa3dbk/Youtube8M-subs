 despite the innumerable benefits of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 you need to be aware of your 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 Side effects

 studies indicate that overuse 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 may even cause cancer 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.170
 the report by asylum 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 cell phone and cell phone walnut 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 nowadays most people do not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.090
 get off the hook 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.660
 I need him then I live 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.410
 zapping by communicating with friends with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.079
 But people are all the time at home to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.750
 play to see some things but it will be 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.289
 that such a popular device can not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 be dangerous to our health 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 it loads a lot of people's heads, huh? 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.930
 advertised with his face on the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 cell phone a headset 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 but nowadays also with the technology 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.210
 with modernity it is difficult to leave the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 cellular care needed in this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 generation is now of immediacy is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.810
 accuracy all hours this is good 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 the researchers say that the device 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.900
 emits invisible electromagnetic waves 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 to our eyes that can change the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 cells 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 the case is so serious that the organization 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.170
 health and the agency 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.710
 for cancer research 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 classified the cell phone as possibly 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 cancerous or celam 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 the change is not because it was not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.229
 considered a risk point and the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 last meeting of them none of the deaths 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.759
 piece reads together and they arrived at 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 conclusion that a cell phone 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.070
 analyzing the study of this could not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 be a factor of the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.229
 the cause of cancer then any 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.570
 technology the product is so collected 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.370
 with the phone caused a lot of big boasting 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.250
 people were worried about a 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.560
 specialist still makes the alert has 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.679
 studies that say that those who do not 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.800
 cell phone for each increase the chances of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:29.180
 getting disease is more the two that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:29.180
 try to connect some 40 people 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.300
 could have greater incidence of the field 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.670
 but if technology is so ingrained 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.160
 in our lives what to do with this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.160
 alert from the World Health Organization 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.510
 talking a long time if you use the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 put memory 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 the guidance does not have a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.739
 Evidence of this relationship but collection 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.489
 possible factor that should have this contact 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.880
 so from sÃ£o paulo to melo nogueira to network 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.880
