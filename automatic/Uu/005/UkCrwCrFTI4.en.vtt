00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.830
 Yes In to today 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.340
 Bow of violin is straight 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.310
 To allow play to the sense of touch to the between 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.370
 I would like to practice 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.190
 by folklore 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.080
 The 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:26.840
 Basically, between this piece and No. 4 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 I put it on the chest at right angles to it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.660
 It will be beautiful if you pull straight 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.660
 This is this is mostly for beginners 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.650
 What drive 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.560
 Hmm 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.020
 It will flow to 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 I think that often flow boast 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.740
 It is here that I will not be hearing a little 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.070
 It will slip the sea 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.070
 me 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670
 I usually 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.840
 When we put out one's hand or hand 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.650
 Five 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.260
 I think you become so feel like writing this is yesterday 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.620
 is 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.620
 That 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.930
 Because what 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 Earlier the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 I put my hand in front 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.390
 Prepare 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.750
 Straight like 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.200
 When you come back to practice 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 Because 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.210
 You will practice long tones as Sue 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 Well 8 First of all from the original to the middle is the elbow 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:47.820
 Mainly above and below the elbow 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.659
 The forearm part and skip to that and I do is think in national rather from that middle earlier of whether it is 1 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.659
 Put out before 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.180
 I can not laugh 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.180
 The snack is also up at that time 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 I feel like this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.680
 Before I put it back, I've got a bad breath again 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.740
 I'm conscious of such things and practice, but quite 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.460
 By all means 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.460
 Pooh 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.340
 Falls games 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.720
 It says whether to correct and to what wind 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.470
 It's a wall 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.920
 Using the wall 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.230
 Per middle ultra 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.870
 Per the middle of the finger 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.300
 Direct the elbow to the wall 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.870
 It is attached 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.160
 Lou was a little while ago hey straight from say so 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.300
 crew 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.810
 Adjust this by yourself as it changes with the angle of the instrument 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.810
 Wind 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.640
 It is good to do a famous place 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.310
 At this time there is no elbow, but it is a good item when the original goes , but 2 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.830
 I do not seem to be behind 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.240
 I think that nature and hands are according to before 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.240
 If you get a 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 me 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.660
 Being spent 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.110
 I think that it is good to be doing such practice 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.550
 after 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.310
 Ets 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.310
 Umebayashi if you try this objectively 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.500
 Climb becomes you 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.160
 Have you I'm easy to understand that the increase 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.970
 If you look at it from your own side, it is quite 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.550
 Because it is straight 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.890
 I don't feel like I'm looking at it from an angle 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:47.460
 Or do you like to put it on your chest or something like this 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.500
 Way, looking into the exception of 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.460
 In the eyes of the knock of the effect grade from above 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.270
 Now whether you are straight made Kuhn 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.270
 Grinded in while my lord 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.670
 Putsu 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.540
 Water 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 Ah 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 It is this neighborhood is good even in per in this 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.220
 In addition to cheering 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.900
 It's good to go up the back gradually grabbed the straight sense of goods this in Ayatsu 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.999
 That 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.970
 Support up to bubbles 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.580
 This way 8 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.910
 Correction 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:58.169
 I wonder if it is 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:01.169
 I think it may be practiced as straight and for the evening grilled matter 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:06.979
 Then today is this 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.979
 I will finish flowering practice to straighten the finger
