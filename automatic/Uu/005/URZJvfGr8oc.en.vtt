00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good guys how are you sinflow 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.400
 street and we are in a race with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 subscribers this time with our author 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.650
 albal paper and we have many rivals 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 to win today in this race as well 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.250
 let's go to it 3 2 1 and forward 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.839
 we go out we're still pretty good with the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 turbo have tried to get us out of the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.810
 road so nothing but start but not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.640
 has gotten back one of two already 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.930
 you know standard career and it came without 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.330
 contact but you know that I play 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.439
 it is always true we know that also the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.810
 Rebounds serve to overtake too much 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 until they come and uncover take boy 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 to the and now you come and tell me that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 Come on, it 's dead, you're dead, come on, lad. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 I just got off the road but 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 I do not care because I lose point 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 out kid call me the chungo me 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.100
 they call the chung heras to see we enter not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 We walked in and we will somersault 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.690
 because yes because we can because we want 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.850
 because it's going to open us like that to see we're going to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.620
 me at this point we bother and great 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.059
 we continue with the race mother of mine in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 a moment everything we have done and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.430
 We have been freaking attention worth 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 here you can also roll well we follow 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.010
 forwards we only have two 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.750
 uncles in front we have already begun to fail 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 We have two uncles in front of the voice 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 truth is that it can be quite 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 complicated to overtake if they start to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.200
 catch and road and do not achieve 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 no kidding 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.479
 this this can be a point of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 inflection in the race why why 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 why can it be that we are leaving very 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.869
 far and until we do not catch it right 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.979
 Valvaler the shit and until we 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.429
 we caught it is going to be quite 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 complicated but good let's see it to see 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.920
 what is there to do here is worth what is this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 what is this what is this please tell me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 that I have wrong car attention 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030
 it is no longer valid 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.710
 narrowly 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.290
 please someone explain it to me 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.230
 because it does not make much sense 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.180
 does not make much sense to see if it is 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.940
 guided why it happened I want to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 know it's worth we continue we must give the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.600
 perfect return 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.150
 It's worth, hello, sun, but if I continue 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.700
 there or is it super mega dude one thing 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.140
 a question to see who is always 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.520
 much more than any other car is not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.690
 has noticed less to me that is the sensation 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.030
 is that whenever I play with the under 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.710
 I bust 40% more times than with 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.180
 any other car I do not know why and with 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.610
 the one that less with the environment is worth 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.640
 let's see we have here just an entity 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.020
 what is bothering me let's go 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.850
 look at annoyed chasm that got me out 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.930
 from what he was doing uncle of 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.630
 there are people who have passed me 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 I'm still here and that can not be 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.020
 it can be by the last in fact by 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.760
 please I do not know what you do with your life god 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.140
 accelerates without looking at what you're doing 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.010
 will let you pass many thanks 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.440
 true finally take off we paste 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.290
 we enter, we go to the top, we turn around 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.310
 ok we go very well we continue for the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.080
 stop attention 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.600
 I'm not touching anything, I'm all 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 doing them alone and now perfect that 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.870
 we see here and attention that have passed 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 neither more nor less than five people more 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.069
 I'm the sixth and I do not like that 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.620
 I mean, I thought they went a lot more 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.239
 and it can not be can not be this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 exposed two laps I think two laps 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 so I hope they catch something 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.129
 because it is that if the thing is not enough 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.019
 complicated to see now you have to go by 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.420
 down here still perfect towards the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.280
 left is very well taken care of with the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.250
 hedges that call them the hardest hedges 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.370
 from the universal universe to work to see 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.159
 this looks like being pretty 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.420
 at the same time as tota pelotillas 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.549
 you understand what I want to tell you 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.739
 I double folded blas flow for me 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.200
 perfect has blown really well and now to 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.969
 see here is worth that busted so 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.579
 which someone has died to them so 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.359
 least has had almost death on top not 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.489
 no no no I do not say capable busting me 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.159
 it kills and everything is quite slow 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.439
 order and that around here to see mate 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.239
 AndrÃ©, please, so many beeps 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.340
 a lot of history but it stops happening to me 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.219
 see please is recharging the point 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.299
 I do not know why it do not worry 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.489
 good the situation so you can 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.719
 continue to be perfect, just like you 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.310
 it bothers last city to the other over here 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.659
 to see not so much time is worth but the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.609
 dress so that is the most thing or 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.500
 less equal so well let's go to 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.480
 we're going to it back number 2 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.740
 I am this position yet this can not 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.120
 to stay like this because I can eat an ene 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.160
 I was really fat and it was like that and I did not 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.080
 would like the situation of with ene efe well 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 that we go there 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.800
 Okay, do not read it, it's ok, see you later 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.970
 fellow transfer just like before that 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.080
 uncle who was at the beginning of the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.880
 career that I think I was trying to get 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.770
 or something like that I think it's been if I know not 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.260
 I'm sure but I think so 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.060
 and well we are on our way again to the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.950
 empty action and you know guys that is 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.120
 quite complicated but there are people who 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.470
 It's very good and what can happen to 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.270
 the first one and you can let an ene 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.330
 efe quite fat in the case of me not 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.560
 it happens less in the first times truth 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.570
 I do not like anything that happens 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.940
 things but the times is to say can happen 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.530
 everything can happen in this life, I think 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.610
 that this is the ninth at least that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.500
 it is bothering me just as annoyed 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.100
 and to the other, this is already pure karma and 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.620
 hard 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.500
 please the truth that I'm nervous 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 because we are 4 and a half minutes already 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.340
 possibly after an ene efe 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.460
 or can the leader win there are two that 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.510
 have already gone by please no uncle there 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.670
 two that have already happened is to say the 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.780
 first and the second to finish already 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.660
 OK 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.570
 let's go tell me that they ask for it well ok let's go 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.270
 today the fourth attention I can 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.880
 get yes sir sir and it's worth what 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.350
 I get the room is not for nothing 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.600
 bad position with taking into account 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.160
 that we're ninth that we're going 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.290
 damn last in the race that is not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.940
 it is no bad position and already good 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.920
 It turns out that I happened to it 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.630
 all the first in the second round 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.370
 obviously so well here we go 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.110
 there is the third one is but overtake him 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.850
 please tell me yes and see that this 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 third as soon as I can I look at it let's go no 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.180
 you hook up ok I'll look at it if that third 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.860
 is the third just finished just the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.510
 first and that uncle in front is the 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.160
 third, what I want to advance you 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.080
 I want as much as I do not know if I'm going to 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.540

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.460
 vertebra please double-double flow no 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.050

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.360
 he was watching me come since I've 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.600
 taken the curve cursed uncle 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.370
 damn damn speed all uncle by 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.620
 out we jump here 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.090
 I do not think it happens well because it happens to me 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:00.000
 same 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.260
 continued also and at least the 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.270
 trampita but I could not so good 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.990
 the second one finishes the third 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.490
 and here enters flow in fourth position 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.570
 so nothing guys you know I hope that 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.880
 have you enjoyed this race that the 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.229
 truth has been complicated because 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.220
 first for the first east for the first 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.540
 try but the truth is that it was quite 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.830
 easy to make the spirals 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.570
 in the curves and now pretty easy 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.949
 because it was guided so nothing guys 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.270
 I hope you liked it and I would like 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.699
 that is a law that we always have nothing 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.090
 your creations are and until next time 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.090
 goodbye
