some<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.960> methodologies<00:00:01.350> are

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
some of the methodologies are

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.630 
some of the methodologies are
traditional<00:00:04.290> methodologies<00:00:04.980> for<00:00:05.190> lack<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.400> a

better<00:00:05.670> word<00:00:06.890> sure<00:00:07.890> bang<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.790> great<00:00:09.450> i<00:00:09.480> mean

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
better word sure bang is is great i mean

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.839 
better word sure bang is is great i mean
it's<00:00:10.200> there's<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.099> continues

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
it's there's a reason it continues

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.249 
it's there's a reason it continues
through<00:00:12.030> all<00:00:12.150> different<00:00:12.330> mediums<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
through all different mediums to get to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.230 
through all different mediums to get to
certain<00:00:13.530> majors<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.519> then<00:00:14.639> there<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.849> things

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
certain majors and then there are things

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.210 
certain majors and then there are things
that<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.480> specific<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.350> digital<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that are very specific to digital and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.929 
that are very specific to digital and
then<00:00:17.880> there<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.090> things<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.810> tagging

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
then there are things that this tagging

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
then there are things that this tagging
this<00:00:20.939> ability<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.630> code<00:00:21.900> trackball<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
this ability to code trackball make it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.880 
this ability to code trackball make it
even<00:00:23.640> more<00:00:23.699> sort<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.650> interesting<00:00:25.650> or

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
even more sort of interesting or

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
even more sort of interesting or
different<00:00:25.920> from<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> digital<00:00:26.789> perspective

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
different from the digital perspective

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.460 
different from the digital perspective
so<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> try<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.170> through

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
so we're going to try to go through

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.060 
so we're going to try to go through
these<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:29.189> quickly<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.640> possible<00:00:30.060> there's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
these as quickly as possible there's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.580 
these as quickly as possible there's
effectiveness<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:33.020> sort<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> post<00:00:34.380> by

their panels and integrated it with TV

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.710 
their panels and integrated it with TV
then<00:02:00.470> that's<00:02:00.649> great<00:02:00.950> let's<00:02:01.190> use<00:02:01.429> that<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.910> to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
then that's great let's use that to to

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.529 
then that's great let's use that to to
get<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.200> did<00:02:04.070> we<00:02:04.190> deliver<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.729> demo<00:02:05.000> did<00:02:05.420> we

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
get to did we deliver the demo did we

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.080 
get to did we deliver the demo did we
liver<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.960> reach<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.290> frequency<00:02:06.759> tied<00:02:07.759> back

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
liver the reach and frequency tied back

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.330 
liver the reach and frequency tied back
to<00:02:08.329> some<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.869> data<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:09.560> used<00:02:09.979> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to some of the data that we used that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.759 
to some of the data that we used that
told<00:02:11.090> us<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.450> go<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.870> direction<00:02:12.079> in<00:02:12.590> terms

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
told us to go in that direction in terms

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.190 
told us to go in that direction in terms
of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110 
of
so<00:02:14.200> double-click<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.739> was<00:02:15.099> wonderful<00:02:16.090> for

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so double-click that was wonderful for

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.509 
so double-click that was wonderful for
what<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.599> not<00:02:17.170> necessarily<00:02:17.709> tied<00:02:18.159> to

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
what they do not necessarily tied to

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.809 
what they do not necessarily tied to
some<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.000> true<00:02:19.420> reach<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.959> frequency

some of that true reach and frequency

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.640 
some of that true reach and frequency
unduplicated<00:02:21.819> audience<00:02:22.659> delivery<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.409> a<00:02:23.470> lot

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
unduplicated audience delivery and a lot

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.479 
unduplicated audience delivery and a lot
of<00:02:23.680> dialogues<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.519> fairly<00:02:25.420> inexpensively<00:02:26.110> on

these<00:02:27.489> reports<00:02:27.970> are<00:02:28.090> usually<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> be<00:02:29.170> done

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
these reports are usually can be done

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.960 
these reports are usually can be done
with<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> partner<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.010> Nelson<00:02:30.579> in<00:02:30.700> terms<00:02:30.879> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
with a partner like Nelson in terms of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.020 
with a partner like Nelson in terms of
that<00:02:31.060> baseline<00:02:31.690> audience<00:02:32.530> download

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
that baseline audience download

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.070 
that baseline audience download
depends<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> size<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.569> campaign<00:02:35.930> on

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
depends on the size of the campaign on

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.449 
depends on the size of the campaign on
what<00:02:36.260> we<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:36.590> deliver<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.099> things<00:02:37.280> like<00:02:37.400> that

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
what we can deliver and things like that

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.490 
what we can deliver and things like that
but<00:02:37.879> generally<00:02:38.690> speaking<00:02:38.720> will<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.410> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
but generally speaking will get you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.619 
but generally speaking will get you
whether<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.860> delivered<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.340> or<00:02:40.459> not<00:02:40.610> based<00:02:41.480> on

whether you delivered it or not based on

some<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:41.930> flowering<00:02:42.379> then<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.459> into

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
some of that flowering then we get into

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600 
some of that flowering then we get into
sort<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.000> behavioral<00:02:44.780> tracking<00:02:45.319> right<00:02:45.739> what
