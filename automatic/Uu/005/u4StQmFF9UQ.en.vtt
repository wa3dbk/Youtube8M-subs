00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello everyone happy to see you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.500
 on the plateau of paris turf tv for 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 our daily show received 5 out of 5 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 in the wind said I found by my side 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.540
 emmanuel bullet to the day emmanuel bond 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.809
 hello alexandre hello to all and to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.910
 all 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 emmanuel so this wednesday we will be at 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 vincennes for the price of the island and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 naughty where a test with the European label 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 they will be eighteen competitors from 6 to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 10 years to fight on the 2100 meters 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.550
 of the great emmanuel track would 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 downright hit me when I did the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 paper I found he has a lot of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 nominations mocked that we could all 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.250
 in fact suddenly we leave on a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.829
 arrived in quotes easy this 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.420
 seems easy it's a half cent 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.129
 faster in the front line the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.230
 defer to the front line the most 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.000
 young people on the front line so we sell 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
 pro mali good ben we wait two 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 selections at the low manu so a priori 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.969
 with at the head the 5 goes the royal in front of the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 4 the ultra danish the 3rd has neither the sz ur to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.059
 bottom of the bridge the two princess photos the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.090
 13 single of the iton the 6 snitch of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.290
 polished and the 12 us to put you in the lead 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 at the training of jean michel bazire 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.420
 the 5 goes the royal who just played from 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.310
 bad luck 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 yes it will be the logical favorite of the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 France whole déferré of the four 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.159
 horse made a losing foul 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.430
 the other day I think that without his fault 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.610
 he would have imposed 2100 it's not the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 true 2100 but hey I think the choice 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.939
 there a little bit tomorrow son it should 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.700
 compensate it's my logical favorite 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.950
 the favorite of the whole France if he does not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 not win the royal endorsement I do not think so 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 that they can win his race this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 winter it's really his race okay 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.270
 in theoretical agree my anchor is of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.880
 a little bit the distance 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 yeah that's not it's not the only one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.649
 made for 2007 big track only on a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.689
 2100 with strangers it is likely to be 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.890
 a little faster but I think 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.200
 jean louis will come quietly his 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
 okay you oppose leucate 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 ultra danish it's good that's our 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.049
 mini bono land jolivet such is the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.759
 meeting of the bigeon family who 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.430
 pretty confident watch with this fall game 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.650
 late wins 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.210
 question you will present in this 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.320
 ultra-Danish quinté whose last 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.560
 performance is the best that there 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.090
 last time they sell badly 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.410
 finished but I did not want to run 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
 behind trying to make a good one for 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.850
 finish he did it without the horse anymore 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.459
 hard to find each other anyway while 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.020
 winter at work it seems better he 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.370
 seems more toned 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.350
 no longer want so it's true that on 2100 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.390
 meters pulled a good number the fal 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.560
 seems the lot also on a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.300
 old value that would be a first 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 luck there are 12 and a half market 1 on this 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.230
 course the patrol was at the top 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 I think it's a horse that's going to 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.940
 find little by little so he was not 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.730
 not yet 100% but I think it 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.020
 can still be waiting with in 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.490
 neighborhoods especially déferré of 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.780
 later it was not this winter 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.530
 here we do not have to drill until 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.050
 present everything is fighting so good this is true 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.330
 that bring it smells good wisely 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 attacked people by being a little negative and 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.910
 finally the horse finds himself even 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.160
 if he at 100% at work and step up 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.940
 tilled soil for the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.130
 first time of winter 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 finally beautiful engagement every time there is 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.330
 a bad program but I was not 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 ready the leaf quoted not exceptional on 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.990
 did not see anything of transcendent but there 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.090
 it's a race that constitutes a 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.170
 goal if it's not in the three 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.150
 I will still be the first disappointed 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.590
 think his place and his podium 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.570
 still there is the 4 there are a lot of 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.670
 things for him as after you 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.580
 place a female on August 3 nani who 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.709
 rest on two foam failures that's it 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.340
 mega finds it to a commitment 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.170
 favorable 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.940
 yeah that was wiser a track 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.890
 flat in the past now finds 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.450
 that vincennes to his fate if so 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.160
 that she has a good commitment is the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.170
 case my course i think with eric 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.990
 Monday will be the case make me into lé 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.580
 12.5 his course is enough that 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.040
 did four or five had train 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.140
 to arrive and maybe a little less well 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.340
 although rabbit bear the journey of 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.200
 side of Toulouse where my husband told me 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 always said about the 2100 to vincennes l 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.070
 es12 each time on 2007 had 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.320
 always 14 she is serious when 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.150
 before sagged value at each 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.630
 time she must be in the khat and a 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 access 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.690
 we can count on it yeah I think 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.970
 with his number there anyway 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.700
 I think 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.780
 it's almost a base at least for 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.970
 to be three four or five 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.740
 agree the sweat down the bridge 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.460
 maybe a number a little tricky 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.530
 now she has just won 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.239
 ferrer and the false-bound alley to the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.340
 unlikely limits disappointed me more than one 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.890
 once won at the wins and easy shoeing 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.380
 it was good that the females were 14 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.650
 break-in there are the aliens and 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.970
 was going bad and the six years old but hey 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.350
 difficult to go against an owl who 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.370
 has just won pleasantly ferrying that 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.130
 find in the fats and more 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.770
 she had 9 good there it's a humor a 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.390
 little trap but it's theoretically 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.890
 impossible to ignore 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.210
 his chances in view of his last 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.740
 victory 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.290
 and finally you complete your selection 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.240
 of five horses acle of photos 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.040
 princess that 's what has already made her 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.650
 values ​​on our soil yes it's a ten 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.960
 years against his younger and younger 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.810
 it sounds a bit complicated but it's not 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.810
 not the case it's the foreign mare 's 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.300
 speed she's struggling to start at the volt 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.830
 autostart can get the benefit 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.630
 pours slowly improves but 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.540
 surely to vincennes is not it is not 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.360
 it's not by eating castrum it's not 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.210
 good of you but he knows 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.100
 perfectly his mare pictures taken 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.800
 with a small number starting better 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.780
 that at the volt she must appear in 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.640
 the arrival of the cnca so we saw a 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.830
 manual we go on rather things the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.120
 first for bases to 2 3 4 5 in 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.720
 our investigation 5 and then mullahs then we 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.130
 wait for reports 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.810
 we waited for an intimate relationship when 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.460
 even to point the turfists on 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.840
 two things that are not in my 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.550
 first five but that I kept when 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.870
 even the ciss live in fonts 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.700
 it's for me the best choice of 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.590
 the water but it stays I 'm still going to me 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.680
 it is delayed from the cages puts it in the head 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.810
 I wanted to clarify and the 12 us to pose 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.880
 problem in the sense that by the way in 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.919
 the section drives the family 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.790
 thomas plays the game and a commitment the 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.979
 February 22 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.979
 I want to clarify to the turfists that the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:00.250
 February 22 it will limit head 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.560
 recoil probably deferred from 482 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.210
 million and that if he finishes in the 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.280
 first four there they jump 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.070
 the commitment now I think the 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.900
 thomas family game 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.370
 I can be in the three 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.210
 first he appears on arrival but 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.200
 know they have a very beautiful 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.700
 commitment on February 22 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.920
 good is always good to report in 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.150
 any case during 1min turfiste emmanuel 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.440
 I think we did an analysis 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.360
 complete of this test 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.550
 thank you very much we find ourselves 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.800
 obviously on this plateau for a 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.390
 week dedicated to the six others 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.340
 still with the price of France have 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.760
 obviously we hope, by the way, who will be 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.970
 support of the 515e 500 3 0 we cross the 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.190
 fingers 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.200
 thank you manual is in good foam web 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.200
 see you soon see you soon see you soon
