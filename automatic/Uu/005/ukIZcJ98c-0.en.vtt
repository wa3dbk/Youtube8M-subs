00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.040 
anxious or whatever it is but me
personally<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.450> shoot<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.690> lot<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.930> my

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
personally I like to shoot a lot of my

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 
personally I like to shoot a lot of my
b-roll<00:02:33.319> stuff<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.769> slow-mo<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.120> I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
b-roll stuff in slow-mo just so that I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.120 
b-roll stuff in slow-mo just so that I
have<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.480> option<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.200> speed<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> up<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.099> need

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
have the option to speed it up if I need

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.210 
have the option to speed it up if I need
to<00:02:37.519> or<00:02:37.550> slow<00:02:38.120> mode<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.660> want<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:40.010> don't

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
to or slow mode if I want but I don't

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.589 
to or slow mode if I want but I don't
know<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.550> always<00:02:40.700> kind<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.060> makes<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.390> more

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
know it always kind of makes it more

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.680 
know it always kind of makes it more
like<00:02:42.760> intense<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.970> guess<00:02:44.209> when<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.569> in

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
like intense I guess when it's in

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.420 
like intense I guess when it's in
slow-mo<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.799> camera<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.280> can

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
slow-mo so if you have a camera that can

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.150 
slow-mo so if you have a camera that can
go<00:02:46.549> 120<00:02:47.090> frames<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.420> second<00:02:47.690> or<00:02:47.810> 240<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.560> would

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
go 120 frames a second or 240 I would

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
go 120 frames a second or 240 I would
definitely<00:02:49.610> use<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.819> all<00:02:50.390> right<00:02:50.510> guys

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
definitely use it all right guys

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.620 
definitely use it all right guys
a<00:02:51.260> big<00:02:52.160> thing<00:02:52.400> too<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.090> think<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.420> lot<00:02:53.600> of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
a big thing too that I think a lot of

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.470 
a big thing too that I think a lot of
people<00:02:53.989> mess<00:02:54.230> up<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:55.090> lot<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.269> best

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
people mess up on is a lot of the best

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.050 
people mess up on is a lot of the best
b-roll<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.500> tries<00:02:57.910> for<00:02:58.910> when

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
b-roll is just in the tries for when

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.820 
b-roll is just in the tries for when
someone's<00:02:59.390> doing<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.780> clip<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.560> kind<00:03:00.769> of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
someone's doing a clip so it's kind of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.229 
someone's doing a clip so it's kind of
good<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.040> pay<00:03:01.310> attention<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.880> what<00:03:02.060> you're

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
good to pay attention to what you're

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.479 
good to pay attention to what you're
shooting<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.780> sometimes<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.980> clip<00:03:04.250> you

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
shooting and sometimes if a clip you

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.830 
shooting and sometimes if a clip you
notice<00:03:04.910> something<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.239> would<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> good

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
notice something that would be a good

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.620 
notice something that would be a good
b-roll<00:03:06.080> shot<00:03:06.380> mark<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.730> save<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.569> you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
b-roll shot mark it and save it so you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.030 
b-roll shot mark it and save it so you
don't<00:03:08.780> delete<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.140> cuz<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.500> know<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> lot<00:03:10.010> of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
don't delete it cuz I do know a lot of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.920 
don't delete it cuz I do know a lot of
people<00:03:10.430> they'll<00:03:10.670> they'll<00:03:11.299> get<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> clip<00:03:11.750> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
people they'll they'll get a clip and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.780 
people they'll they'll get a clip and
then<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.200> end<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.769> deleting<00:03:13.099> all<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.430> tries

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
then they end up deleting all the tries

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.819 
then they end up deleting all the tries
I<00:03:14.180> definitely<00:03:14.870> don't<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.109> that<00:03:15.290> but<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> lot<00:03:15.769> of

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
I definitely don't do that but a lot of

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.560 
I definitely don't do that but a lot of
the<00:03:15.980> guys<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.400> know<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.910> work<00:03:17.060> with<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.510> do

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
the guys I know and work with they do

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.720 
the guys I know and work with they do
and<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.680> think<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.920> lot<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.280> has<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.430> do<00:03:19.700> with

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
and I think a lot of it has to do with

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.699 
and I think a lot of it has to do with
them<00:03:20.000> not<00:03:20.180> having<00:03:20.390> enough<00:03:20.870> space<00:03:20.989> for<00:03:21.320> storage

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
them not having enough space for storage

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.800 
them not having enough space for storage
so<00:03:22.010> if<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.310> can<00:03:22.579> save<00:03:22.850> all<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> tries<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.660> would

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
so if you can save all the tries I would

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.270 
so if you can save all the tries I would
say<00:03:23.989> do<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.440> sure<00:03:24.650> when<00:03:24.920> you're<00:03:25.040> when

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280
