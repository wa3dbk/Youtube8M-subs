00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
think every shrimp tank should have you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.349 
think every shrimp tank should have you
know<00:00:18.630> most<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.170> pretty<00:00:19.410> simple<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.580> uh<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
know most I'm pretty simple but uh but I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.109 
know most I'm pretty simple but uh but I
feel<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.689> some<00:00:21.900> people<00:00:22.170> don't<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> so

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119

this is a cool cactus one and I use this

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.370 
this is a cool cactus one and I use this
on<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> tanks<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.120> don't<00:02:12.870> use<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
on all the tanks I don't use in this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.190 
on all the tanks I don't use in this
tank<00:02:13.590> yet<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.010> need<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.430> though<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.959> stuff

tank yet I need to though but this stuff

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890 
tank yet I need to though but this stuff
degrades<00:02:16.890> over<00:02:17.100> time<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.480> you're<00:02:18.780> gonna

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
degrades over time and so you're gonna

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.810 
degrades over time and so you're gonna
have<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> keep<00:02:19.350> replacing<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
have to keep replacing it but of the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.100 
have to keep replacing it but of the
shrimp<00:02:21.090> will<00:02:21.209> love<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.720> mean<00:02:21.780> they're

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the center so cooler looks good so I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.590 
the center so cooler looks good so I
would<00:02:32.280> say<00:02:32.430> either<00:02:32.580> Malaysian<00:02:33.120> driftwood<00:02:33.570> or

online you can find them pretty much

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.150 
online you can find them pretty much
anywhere<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> doesn't<00:02:49.500> matter<00:02:49.739> what<00:02:49.950> grade

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
anywhere it doesn't matter what grade

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.680 
anywhere it doesn't matter what grade
you<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.390> grade<00:02:51.630> all<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.989> does<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.380> say

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
you get the grade all it does is say

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.180 
you get the grade all it does is say
basically<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> has<00:02:55.080> holes<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:56.010> it's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
basically if it has holes in it if it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.190 
basically if it has holes in it if it's
wrinkled<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.880> leave<00:02:57.209> looks<00:02:57.510> bad<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:58.050> it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
wrinkled it's leave looks bad then it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.110 
wrinkled it's leave looks bad then it's
a<00:02:58.290> lower<00:02:58.470> grade<00:02:58.739> if<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> leaves<00:02:59.310> perfect<00:02:59.820> like

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
a lower grade if the leaves perfect like

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.090 
a lower grade if the leaves perfect like
this<00:03:00.300> one's<00:03:00.570> perfect<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.560> some<00:03:01.739> reason

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
this one's perfect for some reason

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.030 
this one's perfect for some reason
that's<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.060> higher<00:03:03.239> grade<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.769> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that's a higher grade one and it the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.190 
that's a higher grade one and it the
quality<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:06.150> know<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.420> doesn't<00:03:06.720> matter<00:03:06.900> at

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
quality you know it doesn't matter at

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.780 
quality you know it doesn't matter at
all<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:08.100> whatever<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.549> shrimp

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
all you can just get whatever the shrimp

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.000 
all you can just get whatever the shrimp
don't<00:03:08.970> care<00:03:09.209> unless<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.049> care<00:03:10.290> about<00:03:10.500> look<00:03:10.709> so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
don't care unless you care about look so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.910 
don't care unless you care about look so
I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.880> three<00:03:12.780> most<00:03:12.959> important<00:03:13.440> things

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
I think three most important things

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.580 
I think three most important things
some<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.730> moss<00:03:14.989> preferably<00:03:15.989> java<00:03:16.320> moss

some kind of moss preferably java moss

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.460 
some kind of moss preferably java moss
some<00:03:17.519> kind<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.940> driftwood<00:03:18.330> preferably<00:03:19.170> Cola

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
some kind of driftwood preferably Cola

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.140 
some kind of driftwood preferably Cola
wood<00:03:19.769> or<00:03:20.690> Malaysian<00:03:21.690> driftwood<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.380> then

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
wood or Malaysian driftwood and then

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.340 
wood or Malaysian driftwood and then
Indian<00:03:24.150> almond<00:03:24.450> leaves<00:03:24.630> those<00:03:24.959> are<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.170> three

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
Indian almond leaves those are the three

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.979 
Indian almond leaves those are the three
things<00:03:25.650> every<00:03:25.829> trim<00:03:26.280> tank<00:03:26.610> should<00:03:26.880> have<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.570> if

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
things every trim tank should have so if

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.390 
things every trim tank should have so if
you<00:03:28.049> guys<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.410> any<00:03:28.560> questions<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.130> mean<00:03:29.250> there
