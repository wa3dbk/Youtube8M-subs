00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 hello everyone knows where we are 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 found on the cubes I hope you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.369
 okay that video of the cantons of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.230
 5000 subscribers is true already I am 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.970
 remember the 500 subscribers I had a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.489
 video happened all that so much that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.800
 I was happy he is already at 5010 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 ten times more but simply 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.079
 so it's just crazy so for 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.519
 the saints but I planned to make a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.110
 little done I never did 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.870
 still on the room so that's 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.640
 opportunity 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.670
 so what am I going to ask you to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.910
 to go crazy on the other side is not 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.899
 if you feel like you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.670
 ask hard questions where 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.790
 you 've never had an answer by 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.009
 example I ask you to ask your 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.790
 questions in the comments of this 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.149
 episode 6 with for example faq two 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.390
 points 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.250
 is that what you already have 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 make love with a sick pony by 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.600
 example not a game answers the question 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.300
 now so we need you so 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.770
 here you ask your questions in the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.539
 development in the commentary of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 this video 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.630
 and then I will answer 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.719
 in two days you have two 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.119
 days for two days to ask your 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.820
 question and two days later me I 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.369
 will come on them on the comments I 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 will shout everything and then I'll answer everything 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.409
 what is all that is useful finger 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.729
 on there will be useless stuff like 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.759
 but what can I join our 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.700
 waiters all that no and I 'll go back I 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.380
 the video redirected faq probably so 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.750
 so that's going to be a video would be 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.399
 short today just video for you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.860
 ask to ask your questions this is 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.090
 the 5000 subscribers took the opportunity to ask 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400
 all the questions that goes through you 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.579
 the head 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.370
 so that's the good solution that would have 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:24.090
 been a question you were not asking 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.470
 several more questions to 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.870
 several questions per person because 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 that some peoples acta according to think 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 to a good question that will cost me 2 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 really then asked the love must rest 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.269
 the mine anyway I sort ray so 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.269
 here are all your questions 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.129
 and then and that's what 5000 subscribers 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.610
 it's a crazy thing 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:54.200
 it is now I have not limit I 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.489
 not afraid but I limit if I can in 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.709
 do I tell myself what is it that I do 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.900
 and what I check or here because this 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.359
 that I'm doing will suit the 5000 the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.209
 to know that there are 5000 people 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.629
 who are watching us anyway this is the 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.889
 Stadium 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.859
 finally I mean it's a small stadium 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.299
 what already it fills a small stage where 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.290
 I can not imagine myself in the middle 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.829
 talk and then everyone in 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.099
 cost him 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.680
 I really hurt it makes me a little 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.290
 scared but it makes me really happy to 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.769
 to see that it pleases everyone here we 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.000
 hope it will continue to grow 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.439
 even if I do not do this for the glory I 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.439
 wanted to say many times in all 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:40.280
 5000 case there for that asks the people 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.340
 so here you ask me all your 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.199
 small video issues there today it 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.180
 there will be as many special day faq 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.680
 there is a new episode dolly kubrick 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.300
 was already mounted remains more than the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.490
 post and I would put it 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.260
 and maybe before the faq I do not know 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.170
 do not be shocked if an episode of 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.010
 the team in front of the faq 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:12.390

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:14.340

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.180

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.459
 finished the circuits at this school the one 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.010

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.230
 klein etc 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.610

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.169

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.319
 which alone and that the stone as in 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.889

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.360
 by a little rusty what then this is his 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.229
