00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
everything working properly before you

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.369 
everything working properly before you
really<00:00:52.190> hit<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.399> heavy<00:00:52.760> weights<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
really hit the heavy weights so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.729 
really hit the heavy weights so
immediately<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.100> after<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.969> went<00:00:56.210> into

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
immediately right after that I went into

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.119 
immediately right after that I went into
tricep<00:00:57.739> press<00:00:57.890> downs<00:00:58.219> again<00:00:59.140> 400<00:01:00.140> reps<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.890> a

tricep press downs again 400 reps and a
moderate<00:01:01.579> moderate<00:01:02.539> weight<00:01:02.859> try<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:03.920> keep<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
moderate moderate weight try to keep the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.000 
moderate moderate weight try to keep the
sets<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.260> minimum<00:01:07.189> two<00:01:07.549> sets<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.970> 50

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
sets to a minimum two sets of 50

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.670 
sets to a minimum two sets of 50
and<00:01:10.010> after<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.460> biceps<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.150> triceps<00:01:11.530> 400<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
and after the biceps and triceps 400 you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:37.050 
and after the biceps and triceps 400 you
really<00:01:13.010> feel<00:01:13.340> blood<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.119> arms

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.300 

so<00:01:38.060> then<00:01:38.240> we're<00:01:38.450> good<00:01:38.600> -<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.350> think<00:01:41.110> machine

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
so then we're good - I think machine

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.560 
so then we're good - I think machine
bicep<00:01:43.310> curls<00:01:43.670> typically<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.240> would<00:01:44.420> do

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
bicep curls typically I would do

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.950 
bicep curls typically I would do
straight<00:01:45.530> bar<00:01:45.770> curls<00:01:47.590> for<00:01:48.590> 135<00:01:49.390> 5<00:01:50.390> sets<00:01:50.750> till

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
straight bar curls for 135 5 sets till

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.889 
straight bar curls for 135 5 sets till
failure<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.649> switch<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.460> up<00:01:52.549> today<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
failure but switch it up today to the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.999 
failure but switch it up today to the
machine<00:01:54.759> bicep<00:01:55.759> curls<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:57.770> trying<00:01:57.950> to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
max out until failure for 5 sets of

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:24.140
