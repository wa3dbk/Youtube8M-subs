00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.100 
clear and I'll show you some examples in
a<00:01:29.640> minute<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> need<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.930> able<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
a minute you know you need to be able to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
a minute you know you need to be able to
explain<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.890> quote<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.060> needs<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> be

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
explain the quote so there needs to be

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
explain the quote so there needs to be
some<00:01:33.570> interesting<00:01:33.900> language<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.250> an

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
some interesting language in there or an

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
some interesting language in there or an
interesting<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> interpretation<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.430> be

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
interesting bit of interpretation to be

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.660 
interesting bit of interpretation to be
had<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:39.930> obvious<00:01:40.670> then

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
had because if it's very obvious then

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
had because if it's very obvious then
you're<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:43.409> over<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you're not going to get much over to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.230 
you're not going to get much over to
quotation<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.790> important<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
quotation so it's important to be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
quotation so it's important to be
thoughtful<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> quotes<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.590> use

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
thoughtful about the quotes that you use

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.200 
thoughtful about the quotes that you use
it's<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.790> again<00:01:48.060> we're

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's not just that will do again we're

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.580 
it's not just that will do again we're
back<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> planning<00:01:48.869> making<00:01:49.229> sure<00:01:49.380> you've
