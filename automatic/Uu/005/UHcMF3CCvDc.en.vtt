00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.069
 yes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.990
 very good to all I am I am in 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.669
 another redstone tutorial in the previous 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.680
 tutorial had taught how to make a 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.960
 human tnt cannon and now I'm going to 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.419
 teach how to make a normal tnt pussy 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.820
 and current is worth to make this canyon 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.239
 with any material you have to do 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.180
 this so it has an affinity of two 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.790
 cubes and one of a 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.730
 now I tell you that against longer 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 go further you will go the canyon 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.610
 he has tea that you shoot you are worth 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.410
 a slab here 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.410
 we put water here 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 and that goes for here is worth we put 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.920
 redstone well 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.590
 it's so 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.230
 the important thing that a network does not arrive here 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.320
 so and very important that here there is no 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.860
 great challenge 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.860
 A) Yes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 one for each for each stream 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.500
 we can put the tnt 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.610
 it is very important that this juice remains 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.550
 of water without 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 and to shoot is to press first 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.950
 this wait 5 seconds and then it 's 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 Y 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.920
 has fired the dvd 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.280
 and really this cannon for water 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.370
 server not this player 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.650
 I'd be better to make wars 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.280
 let's shoot again so you can see 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.020
 first this but it 's a little 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.890
 we press the other one that activates and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 shoot 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.270
 and this is all I hope you have 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270
 liked 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.810

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.780
 and if you want to see the other tutorial that is 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.110
 a human cannon I leave you 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.990
 at the end of the video the link without anything 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.319
