00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.330
 boned and we have also chopped 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.570
 You can do it with breast if you prefer 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.640

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.460
 we have an onion a large onion and 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 Italians 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.950
 spoons two spoons good 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.740
 finally olive oil 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.710
 these are all the ingredients that 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.250
 we are going to use for our chopped chicken 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.250
 with 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 Well, here we have the chicken that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 now we are going to salty a little and in 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.180
 how hot we are the oil that already 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.400
 we have it here 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.400
 we'll put the chicken so it 's an envelope 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.750
 we have the chicken and now we are going to add 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 Sun tanning 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.480
 if we are going to leave everywhere 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
 that we already have it ready we have had 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.390
 eight minutes 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.490
 as you can see in the onion and pepper is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.079
 quite hard because people we 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.009
 it interests that it stays a little until 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.039
 crunchy that goes very well 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.519
 and now we simply add 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.519
 currÃ­n 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.290
 and we mix it well 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.819
 Well, we already have it, you see we have 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.340
 mixed well the curry has run 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.409
 all well impregnated with the aroma and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.290
 flavor of curry you can not imagine the 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.650
 smell that comes out of here and now we 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.230
 we go directly to the table to enjoy 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.000
