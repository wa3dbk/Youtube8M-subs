00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.270
 hello everyone knows seco I you 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.210
 find today for this video of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.610
 canigou the duo so the last dungeon 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:28.300
 who came out with the update of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:31.840
 2.18 so done by tram so no 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.519
 care not to armor anything at all 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.449
 of the rox the goal of the game is to kill the 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.380
 the furniture very quickly the most 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.969
 quickly possible to take the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.860
 less damage possible canigou there 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.570
 after you're not very very strong from 400 to 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 pretty much and finally the the disadvantage of 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.350
 to make the difficulty rather it is that of 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 lopp what once these access to the x 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.890
 once a level there and lakes 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.310
 it's good I'll come back on the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.210
 delegate canigou there so there you go 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.729
 what I told you to type in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.920
 maximum you will see that it will go 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.220
 pretty quickly sram crowd 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.970
 r with a chrome bone to not take 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.909
 too much damage and the earth crowd iop 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 with one of armor for rule imitate a 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:30.560
 little bit the damage but 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.380
 finally that's not the dungeon the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.770
 more complicated than online to 160 so 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.229
 even if for a level 60 realized 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.709
 de llo my opinion it's complicated finally 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.850
 so here it is more than the 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:48.229
 last beat me and the case neither blue 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.569
 we will kill with the yop 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.329
 and then we will take care of camille 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.979
 red has it canigou there for the 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.329
 tatters 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.590
 that's where it gets complicated here 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.770
 technical for caliber lakes there is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.969
 a little bit more finally and like 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 the last of the logs must be placed my 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.080
 room is complicated so there must 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.340
 place then there must be two states m in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.629
 is it compared to the inrocks 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.519
 there are two states to put so one 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.319
 aranea state that goes on in the end must 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.360
 that you end up a2p to the dunes invokes 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.450
 for it to be a rock back into 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.849
 the state aranea but it does not work for the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.739
 character who invokes for example place 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.989
 it will be Morocco which would finish p &amp; o du 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.470
 Double it does not work however not 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.239
 it's the finished iop at 2 p o double this 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.569
 will walk and go there from a second and to 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.120
 kehl and almonds reese it is lessened 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.690
 you have to start your turn a2p 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.079
 dunes thus invokes the wii around the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.829
 Tram will be my 2p started at the bottom of 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:08.660
 a ferry so both a box are returned 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 in the state aranea here and so there 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.010
 after the tunes she plays so they 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.690
 are in the aranea state and so the yab 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.670
 starts his turn at 2 p ode and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.010
 invokes so the inrocks are in 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.489
 the state mandri therefore the winning role to help 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.630
 the next time not if you have me 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.069
 followed since the state when when the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.829
 inrocks triggered states actually doing that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.150
 triggers in arachnophobic state that is 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.819
 triggered by the state has reduced to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.780
 inrocks and andro phobia that is 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.430
 triggered by the mandri state of inrocks 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.500
 I hope you will follow me after I 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.290
 am typing it a bone 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.190
 she must have locks to finish 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.830
 so here it was a little fight we 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.090
 still a little bit of a struggle 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.370
 I hope this video will have you 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.780
 more if you have any questions yet 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.440
 once do not hesitate I will answer with 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.840
 a great pleasure 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.840
 hello all ciao bye
