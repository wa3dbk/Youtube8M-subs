00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
see it but someone in the back of the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
see it but someone in the back of the
label<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.530> wanna<00:00:52.710> check<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.399> proteins

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
label you wanna check for your proteins

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
label you wanna check for your proteins
and<00:00:54.890> your<00:00:55.890> fibers

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and your fibers

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
and your fibers
this<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.629> 34%<00:00:58.760> protein<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> only<00:01:00.600> has<00:01:00.690> 5%

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this one has 34% protein and only has 5%

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.779 
this one has 34% protein and only has 5%
fat<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> fish

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
fat which is very good for the fish

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.570 
fat which is very good for the fish
helps<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.210> grow<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.539> fast<00:01:04.309> life<00:01:05.309> feeding

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
helps them grow really fast life feeding

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.570 
helps them grow really fast life feeding
I<00:01:06.140> guess<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.439> feed<00:01:07.619> them<00:01:07.710> live<00:01:08.189> feed

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
I guess you can feed them live feed

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
I guess you can feed them live feed
every<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.479> often<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.979> often<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
every so often but the more often you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
every so often but the more often you
feed<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.119> they're<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.360> get

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
feed them the more they're gonna get

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
feed them the more they're gonna get
aggressive<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:13.770> up

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
aggressive you can see they're all up

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.710 
aggressive you can see they're all up
here<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.270> getting<00:01:15.360> ready<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> eat<00:01:17.720> alright

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.800 

typically<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.070> feed<00:01:37.460> them<00:01:37.580> little<00:01:38.330> pinches<00:01:38.659> at

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
typically I feed them little pinches at

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.249 
typically I feed them little pinches at
a<00:01:38.840> time<00:01:39.400> cuz<00:01:40.400> otherwise<00:01:40.909> we'll<00:01:41.630> be<00:01:41.659> wasting<00:01:42.200> a

a time cuz otherwise we'll be wasting a

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.130 
a time cuz otherwise we'll be wasting a
lot<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.500> food<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:44.150> they<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:44.420> slowly<00:01:44.750> sink

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
lot of food and they just slowly sink

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:59.080 
lot of food and they just slowly sink
down<00:01:45.350> here

recommend getting some kind of catfish

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.680 
recommend getting some kind of catfish
that's<00:02:36.530> compatible<00:02:37.459> with<00:02:37.940> African<00:02:38.299> cichlids

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
that's compatible with African cichlids

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.520 
that's compatible with African cichlids
because<00:02:39.080> they<00:02:39.349> are<00:02:39.470> very<00:02:39.650> aggressive<00:02:39.860> fish

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
because they are very aggressive fish

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.750 
because they are very aggressive fish
because<00:02:42.530> sometimes<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.160> might<00:02:43.280> over<00:02:43.549> feed

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
because sometimes you might over feed

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.180 
because sometimes you might over feed
them<00:02:43.970> or<00:02:44.630> phoom<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.079> fall<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> bottom<00:02:45.739> that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
them or phoom I fall to the bottom that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.610 
them or phoom I fall to the bottom that
haven't<00:02:46.459> been<00:02:46.549> eaten<00:02:47.030> by<00:02:47.239> them<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.470> good

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
haven't been eaten by them and it's good

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.990 
haven't been eaten by them and it's good
to<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.890> some<00:02:49.069> kind<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.310> catfish<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.880> they'll

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
to have some kind of catfish so they'll

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.900 
to have some kind of catfish so they'll
eat<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.299> foot<00:02:50.510> off<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.780> bottom<00:02:51.170> because

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
eat that foot off the bottom because

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.809 
eat that foot off the bottom because
after<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> while<00:02:53.030> builds<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.780> pockets<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
substrate causes bacteria that you don't

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.150 
substrate causes bacteria that you don't
want<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.459> there<00:02:59.049> to<00:03:00.049> be<00:03:00.170> careful<00:03:00.590> how<00:03:00.860> much<00:03:00.920> you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
want in there to be careful how much you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.569 
want in there to be careful how much you
feed<00:03:01.370> them<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:02.860> usually<00:03:03.860> just<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.400> little

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
feed them I usually just do little

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.860 
feed them I usually just do little
pinches<00:03:04.940> at<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> time

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.380 

until<00:03:08.680> they<00:03:08.800> don't<00:03:08.950> really<00:03:09.280> eat<00:03:09.550> anymore<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.239> I

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
until they don't really eat anymore as I

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:23.580 
until they don't really eat anymore as I
save<00:03:10.920> food<00:03:21.030> I'll<00:03:22.030> show<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.300> video<00:03:22.720> or<00:03:23.019> two<00:03:23.050> some

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
save food I'll show a video or two some

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.789 
save food I'll show a video or two some
live<00:03:23.800> feeds<00:03:24.129> later<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> wait<00:03:26.590> till<00:03:26.739> they

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
live feeds later on so I wait till they

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:35.479 
live feeds later on so I wait till they
get<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> little<00:03:27.099> bit<00:03:27.310> bigger

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.979 

one<00:03:36.150> last<00:03:36.359> pinch<00:03:36.689> here<00:03:38.480> see<00:03:39.480> those<00:03:39.659> big<00:03:39.989> ones

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
one last pinch here see those big ones

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:50.440 
one last pinch here see those big ones
see<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:45.599> laughs<00:03:46.019> right<00:03:46.319> there

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.259 

like<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.599> said<00:03:51.659> filtration<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> very<00:03:52.920> good

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
like I said filtration is a very good

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.369 
like I said filtration is a very good
key<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.980> housing<00:03:55.980> these<00:03:56.159> fish<00:04:00.379> especially

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
key and housing these fish especially

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.319 
key and housing these fish especially
having<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.159> rocks<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.700> they<00:04:02.819> can<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.150> and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
having the rocks that they can go and

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.690 
having the rocks that they can go and
hide<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:07.010> alright<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.069> think<00:04:08.129> this<00:04:08.400> will<00:04:08.489> be<00:04:08.579> the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
hide in alright I think this will be the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.420 
hide in alright I think this will be the
last<00:04:08.849> pinch<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.389> they're<00:04:09.480> done<00:04:13.010> see<00:04:14.010> here<00:04:14.220> you

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
last pinch and they're done see here you

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.400 
last pinch and they're done see here you
can<00:04:14.599> it's<00:04:15.599> kind<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.870> hard<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.079> see<00:04:16.289> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
can it's kind of hard to see the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.620 
can it's kind of hard to see the
floating<00:04:16.940> palettes<00:04:17.940> here<00:04:18.000> oh<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.479> see

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
floating palettes here oh you can see

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.999 
floating palettes here oh you can see
them<00:04:18.840> on<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.079> top<00:04:21.470> they<00:04:22.470> usually<00:04:22.620> don't<00:04:22.800> eat

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
them on the top they usually don't eat

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.560 
them on the top they usually don't eat
them<00:04:23.130> off<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> top<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.820> tank<00:04:24.060> or<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.210> bottom

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
them off the top the tank or the bottom

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.420 
them off the top the tank or the bottom
of<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.750> tank<00:04:24.930> usually<00:04:25.860> got<00:04:25.949> away<00:04:26.099> from<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
of the tank usually got away from the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.790 
of the tank usually got away from the
float<00:04:26.639> down<00:04:26.990> see<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.080> think<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.320> fed<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> little

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
float down see I think I fed a little

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.710 
float down see I think I fed a little
too<00:04:28.919> much<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:36.240> once<00:04:36.389> they're<00:04:36.539> done<00:04:36.660> eating

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
too much but once they're done eating

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.510 
too much but once they're done eating
they<00:04:37.139> go<00:04:37.320> down<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.889> bottom<00:04:38.070> here<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.430> can

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
they go down to the bottom here you can

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.950 
they go down to the bottom here you can
see<00:04:38.789> them<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.150> rugs<00:04:44.539> it's<00:04:45.539> definitely<00:04:45.930> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
see them in the rugs it's definitely a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.360 
see them in the rugs it's definitely a
good<00:04:46.110> idea<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.440> have<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> lot<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.860> rocks<00:04:47.099> and

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
good idea to have a lot of rocks and

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.430 
good idea to have a lot of rocks and
hiding<00:04:47.669> spots<00:04:47.990> especially<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.169> breeding

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
hiding spots especially for breeding

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.439 
hiding spots especially for breeding
somewhere<00:04:50.070> where<00:04:50.220> they<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.550> lay<00:04:51.120> their<00:04:51.300> eggs

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
somewhere where they can lay their eggs

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.839 
somewhere where they can lay their eggs
and<00:04:51.720> defend<00:04:52.199> easily<00:04:52.620> from<00:04:52.889> other<00:04:53.250> fish<00:04:53.580> from

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
and defend easily from other fish from

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.560 
and defend easily from other fish from
eating<00:04:54.120> them<00:04:54.380> also<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.360> lot<00:04:57.360> less

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
eating them also just a lot less

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.089 
eating them also just a lot less
stressful<00:04:57.930> when<00:04:58.199> they<00:04:58.289> have<00:04:58.409> places<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.919> hide

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
stressful when they have places to hide

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.500 
stressful when they have places to hide
they're<00:04:59.820> not<00:04:59.940> always<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.479> open<00:05:00.930> that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
they're not always out in the open that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.670 
they're not always out in the open that
blue<00:05:03.510> ones<00:05:03.720> definitely<00:05:03.870> getting<00:05:04.320> some<00:05:04.470> color
