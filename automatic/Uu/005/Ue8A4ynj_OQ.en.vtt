00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 how hello everyone 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.230
 today we are preparing 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.150
 boiled crayfish 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 in general, yesterday 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.240
 we have 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 with comrades were on scuba hunting 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.920
 scored a small amount of cancer and know 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 maybe the place was like that or he 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.309
 maybe there just wasn't any 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.870
 small ones come across therefore when diving 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.790
 chose more or less there somewhere with 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.220
 a kilo of crayfish but i think of it 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.230
 shouldn't cook enough today 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.230
 crayfish and why 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 Here you have packed our crayfish 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.140
 why because storing them is enough 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.100
 difficult without this cap creep out 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.510
 here and so small as not 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 most not and sizes 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.210
 such that we need 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.190
 care old dried 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.370
 very cool very important steel throughout 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 circle 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.320
 that due to i don't know about old age 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.300
 will pull dried sons for such more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.990
 spicy flavor and dill 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 which combine well with meat once 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.850
 boiled crab fresh dill 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.290
 probably show of course but I did not see 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.910
 that young club give 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.460
 characteristic inside but still put 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.280
 I think no salt we will need 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.090
 I'll tell you a little bit just there 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.490
 it turns out literally a spoon with a slide 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.130
 probably a big spoon with a slide per liter 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.910
 I think this water will be enough if 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.740
 put less salt that is neither to 100 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.730
 liters then a beer they will not be very 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.070
 good ones 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.170
 if you shift a little bit more into 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.740
 principle basically nothing wrong with 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 we do not have this yet 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.720
 bay leaf and here is such a large pepper 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.319
 This is all in principle give a little bit to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.209
 power to our our 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.560
 so here we have boiled water very well 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.750
 consider loading 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:47.000
 salt first fall asleep here we have 3 liters 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.930
 add 3 spoons a little bit will be 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.160
 terrible, I think that in principle so 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.550
 ukrov pepper and bay leaf 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.849
 now still put fresh dill here 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.849
 in order to 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.849
 it was more or less normal that i 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.959
 I want to say crayfish do not throw water until 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.739
 does not boil 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.360
 In principle, they are living crayfish read 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:24.110
 so as not to torture animals shaped number 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.950
 we throw immediately trained wait until boil 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.300
 and just along the way our weld 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.300
 the smell has gone now 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.250
 and we will load the water step from us 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:47.400
 boiled and just boiling intensively 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:51.930
 water we drop our times i think that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.260
 cook and in theory if always lived on 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.570
 the river therefore beads said so far 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.660
 the youths turned red in principle not 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.980
 reckoned with you well we have a little more 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.620
 five minutes maximum 10 provari in order 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.510
 to really make sure that they 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.880
 We prepare all the same they are for 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.190
 the river therefore the river is different there 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.680
 microbes there and so on so on 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.680
 so cook minutes 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:29.960
 10 minutes have passed our cancer is ready 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.960
 further boil here 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.800
 let's say that they are ready 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.460
 we all close them 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.520
 let them insist in the text 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 that 's all 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.860
 rahim and 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.030
 our cooked 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.289
 Generally speaking, the capital 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.600
 bother 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.770
 sloboda if there are moments of peace there 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.800
 crayfish basically salt and aside 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.449
 this is the most important thing all the rest 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.579
 to a large extent he no longer has anyone 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.819
 I'll tell you another one of the chips 

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:20.809
 when we cooked cooked in a pan 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.509
 Crayfish there snowdrifts promises laid yes yes 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:27.579
 usually what you do to cool them down faster 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.349
 chest water is drained and turns 

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:34.779
 rakatich principle he he whole consists of 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.249
 protein here protein is not astana and so on 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.819
 it gets very dry not juicy 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.399
 It turns out that the cancer was juicy 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.499
 it is very important to put it in it 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:47.569
 gol glasses in which he cooked it is important 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.569
 And the most interesting that we 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.059
 do to cool faster we can 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.759
 put on don't know there a cart in 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:06:01.279
 end up running water or in 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:03.979
 washbasin it can bathroom when he 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:09.079
 water cools quickly boys cancer 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:10.759
 It turns out quite juicy and you can 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:14.509
 for example here's how we do we cooked 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:18.770
 leave the data to 20 to 30 and after 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:21.240
 this already there sleep he is super 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.360
 and where it is not so 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.569
 not to 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.250
 I think you liked 30 if you 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:32.639
 like some of our subscribe 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:35.699
