make sure you use a heat protectant and
what<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> love<00:00:33.450> most<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.930> hairstyle<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
what I love most about this hairstyle is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
what I love most about this hairstyle is
that<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> curls<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.130> stay<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.360> day

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that the curls will stay in for all day

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
that the curls will stay in for all day
I<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> hard<00:00:37.350> time<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:37.920> hair<00:00:38.100> staying

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I have a hard time with my hair staying

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.650 
I have a hard time with my hair staying
curled<00:00:38.820> especially<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
curled especially we're going to use a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
curled especially we're going to use a
regular<00:00:40.020> curling<00:00:40.590> iron<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.910> it's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
regular curling iron and I think it's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
regular curling iron and I think it's
because<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> clamps<00:00:42.899> calling<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
because of the clamps calling one that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
because of the clamps calling one that
I've<00:00:43.590> been<00:00:43.739> using<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.579> owe<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.450> state

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
I've been using I think I owe the state

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
I've been using I think I owe the state
of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> day<00:00:46.050> curls<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.280> completely

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
of the day curls have to that completely

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
of the day curls have to that completely
because<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.780> even<00:00:48.899> use<00:00:49.110> hairs<00:00:49.320> for

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
because I don't even use hairs for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
because I don't even use hairs for
anything<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> curls<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.610> stay<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.059> for

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690

like<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.080> curl<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.470> first<00:02:57.680> time<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.040> do<00:02:58.189> it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
like the curl the first time you do it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190 
like the curl the first time you do it
you<00:02:58.459> can<00:02:58.610> always<00:02:58.849> redo<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.599> curl<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.049> this

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
you can always redo the curl and this

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.110 
you can always redo the curl and this
usually<00:03:00.680> makes<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.159> a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:01.700> bit<00:03:01.970> more

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
usually makes it a little bit more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.819 
usually makes it a little bit more
curlier<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.780> how<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.019> would<00:03:03.260> probably<00:03:03.650> want

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
curlier and how you would probably want

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.180 
curlier and how you would probably want
