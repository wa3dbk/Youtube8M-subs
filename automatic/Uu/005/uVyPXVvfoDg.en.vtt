00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.960
 Landstede basketball has Sunday afternoon 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.700
 after a blood-curdling final battle 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.950
 extracted from care and security 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.330
 with 7877 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.930
 it is now a one in the quarter final 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.930
 of the playoffs 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.760
 landstede soon took the lead 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.290
 three pointers from holder few and strong 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.120
 game of kendrick without van 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.950
 new plan cities to a comfortable 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.510
 lead after two quarters always 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.239
 public confident that mom 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.800
 share the pot 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.410
 this way they are going to follow and say 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.240
 style also with women there is the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.930
 must ye shall 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.070
 lobo problem goes well if they roll like that 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.600
 continue as we are now we are going 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.500
 will win 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800
 and then it becomes in the third match 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.350
 decided but they save fat rl yes 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 only match that later that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.259
 guest no longer 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 so the last home game just 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.560
 is the beautiful game, I think you 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.259
 inside you are killing he is assuming 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.670
 from that zwolle is definitely going to want 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.700
 you have like have rollers now the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.649
 well where its spicy it is spicy 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.940
 but you will be fine sitting here 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.380
 just sat here just in zwolle 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.649
 what will happen should lead 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.649
 to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.110
 but care and security did lead 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.010
 bit by bit the backlog was good and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.010
 even took the lead 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.420
 jt made two more handsome scores in the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.160
 last 30 seconds of which an 8 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.350
 seconds before time and set his team 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.880
 again in the lead when trying 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.950
 got a shot but that attempt 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.110
 failed and land grabbed the win 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.330
 very p trains but we got it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.740
 what he wanted so those third games 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.850

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.860
 man yes by a win we have 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 won so that is important i think 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.180
 that started well at the end 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 they come closer and closer 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.390
