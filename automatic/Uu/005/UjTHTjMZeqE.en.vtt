00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
hold two flags and not literally it's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
hold two flags and not literally it's
won't<00:01:49.020> trouble<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.500> team<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.220> know

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
won't trouble other team but just know

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
won't trouble other team but just know
where<00:01:50.729> they're<00:01:50.909> gonna<00:01:51.000> spawn<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.720> why<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
where they're gonna spawn that's why I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530 
where they're gonna spawn that's why I
always<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.829> copying<00:01:53.820> only<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.299> flags

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
always like copying only two flags

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.539 
always like copying only two flags
though<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.439> needed<00:01:55.740> three<00:01:55.950> flags<00:01:56.340> here

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
though we needed three flags here

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.520 
though we needed three flags here
because<00:01:56.969> we're<00:01:57.180> getting<00:01:57.360> owned<00:01:57.630> by<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> hundred
