failure MMF you remember MMF you need
neither<00:03:13.620> maximum<00:03:14.340> muscular<00:03:14.790> failure<00:03:15.030> that's

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
neither maximum muscular failure that's

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.640 
neither maximum muscular failure that's
when<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.569> what's<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.049> muscle<00:03:16.290> goes<00:03:16.379> holy

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
when the what's in the muscle goes holy

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.379 
when the what's in the muscle goes holy
shit<00:03:17.010> I've<00:03:17.220> got<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.579> grow<00:03:17.850> because<00:03:18.269> he's

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
shit I've got to grow because he's

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.020 
shit I've got to grow because he's
putting<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.900> much<00:03:19.049> demands<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:20.010> these<00:03:20.579> muscles

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
putting so much demands on these muscles

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.789 
putting so much demands on these muscles
I<00:03:21.090> got<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.359> grow<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.660> compensate<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.440> you

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
I got to grow to compensate that you

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.440 
I got to grow to compensate that you
know<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.519> if<00:03:23.730> you're<00:03:23.880> just<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.209> you're<00:03:24.329> doing

know so if you're just if you're doing

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.330 
know so if you're just if you're doing
10<00:03:24.720> reps<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.319> can<00:03:25.440> actually<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.859> 12<00:03:26.250> reps

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.909 
start eating a lot more food to add to
build<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.820> muscle<00:04:44.150> as<00:04:44.240> well<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:44.919> because

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
build a muscle as well and because

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.200 
build a muscle as well and because
that's<00:04:46.070> when<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.280> muscle<00:04:46.550> actually<00:04:46.759> grows<00:04:47.000> is

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
that's when the muscle actually grows is

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.610 
that's when the muscle actually grows is
when<00:04:47.330> you're<00:04:47.419> out<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.750> gym<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.440> put

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
when you're out of the gym so you put

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.499 
when you're out of the gym so you put
the<00:04:48.710> nutrients<00:04:49.190> in<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.580> put<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.970> fuel<00:04:50.300> in

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
the nutrients in you put the fuel in

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.990 
the nutrients in you put the fuel in
which<00:04:51.020> allows<00:04:51.289> them<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.470> grow<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.070> then<00:04:52.759> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
which allows them to grow and then the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.180 
which allows them to grow and then the
fifth<00:04:53.270> thing<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.810> rest<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:54.770> know<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:55.009> when

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
fifth thing is rest you know that's when

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.260 
fifth thing is rest you know that's when
your<00:04:55.280> muscles<00:04:55.400> really<00:04:55.699> grow<00:04:55.910> that's<00:04:56.060> when

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
your muscles really grow that's when

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.330 
your muscles really grow that's when
they<00:04:56.720> repair<00:04:57.169> themselves<00:04:57.350> when<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:57.889> do<00:04:58.070> work

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
they repair themselves when you do work

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.860 
they repair themselves when you do work
on<00:04:58.490> all<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:58.729> muscle<00:04:59.030> fibers<00:04:59.060> break<00:04:59.660> little

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
on all the muscle fibers break little

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.260 
on all the muscle fibers break little
tiny<00:05:00.080> muscle<00:05:00.410> fibers<00:05:00.680> when<00:05:01.190> you're<00:05:01.729> resting

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
tiny muscle fibers when you're resting

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.640 
tiny muscle fibers when you're resting
that's<00:05:02.539> when<00:05:02.690> they<00:05:02.780> regrow<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.380> that's<00:05:03.500> when

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
that's when they regrow and that's when

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.810 
that's when they regrow and that's when
they<00:05:03.740> grow<00:05:03.860> stronger<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.460> that's<00:05:04.610> when<00:05:04.729> they

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
they grow stronger and that's when they

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.460 
they grow stronger and that's when they
grow<00:05:04.970> more<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.300> them<00:05:05.389> that's<00:05:05.600> how<00:05:05.780> muscle<00:05:06.350> is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
grow more of them that's how muscle is

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.430 
grow more of them that's how muscle is
built<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:07.490> know<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.820> rest<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.360> number<00:05:09.199> five

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
built you know so rest is number five

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.860 
built you know so rest is number five

muscular<00:05:21.470> failure<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:23.500> nutrition<00:05:24.500> get<00:05:25.039> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
muscular failure and nutrition get the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.010 
muscular failure and nutrition get the
food<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.550> not<00:05:25.669> just<00:05:25.820> nutrition<00:05:26.360> but<00:05:26.539> get<00:05:26.900> as

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
be go back into the gym when your

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.439 
be go back into the gym when your
muscles<00:05:37.070> are<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:37.490> sore<00:05:37.520> make<00:05:38.060> sure<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.270> get<00:05:38.330> to

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
muscles are so sore make sure you get to

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.689 
muscles are so sore make sure you get to
take<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.690> good<00:05:38.870> few<00:05:39.080> days<00:05:39.229> off<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:40.340> lot<00:05:40.669> of

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
take a good few days off and a lot of

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.029 
take a good few days off and a lot of
the<00:05:40.789> muscles<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.240> grow<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:42.050> then<00:05:42.889> go<00:05:43.010> back

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
the muscles to grow and then go back

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.159 
the muscles to grow and then go back
into<00:05:43.159> the<00:05:43.370> gym<00:05:43.550> too<00:05:44.240> many<00:05:44.389> people<00:05:44.599> over<00:05:44.870> train

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
into the gym too many people over train

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.779 
into the gym too many people over train
better<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.650> under<00:05:45.889> train<00:05:46.099> than<00:05:46.280> over<00:05:46.520> train

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
better to under train than over train

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.370 
better to under train than over train
you'll<00:05:47.180> still<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:47.510> get<00:05:47.690> better<00:05:47.930> results<00:05:48.110> by

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
you'll still you get better results by

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.810 
you'll still you get better results by
under<00:05:48.650> training<00:05:48.860> than<00:05:49.070> over<00:05:49.310> training<00:05:49.520> and

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
under training than over training and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.040 
under training than over training and
then<00:05:50.030> you'll<00:05:50.150> find<00:05:50.419> somewhere<00:05:50.659> in<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.810> middle

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
then you'll find somewhere in the middle

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.560 
then you'll find somewhere in the middle
okay<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:51.830> that's<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.340> high-intensity<00:05:52.789> video

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
okay so that's the high-intensity video

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.899 
okay so that's the high-intensity video
for<00:05:53.870> now<00:05:54.050> and<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:55.190> know<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.310> want<00:05:55.760> to<00:05:55.789> get

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
for now and you know you want to get

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.300 
for now and you know you want to get
done<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.210> gym<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.599> want<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.900> add<00:05:57.080> your<00:05:57.889> get<00:05:58.280> a

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
done the gym you want it add your get a

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.500 
done the gym you want it add your get a
real<00:05:58.490> physique<00:05:58.820> you<00:05:59.030> need<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.210> take<00:05:59.330> those

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
real physique you need to take those

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.510 
real physique you need to take those
five<00:05:59.720> things<00:05:59.750> into<00:06:00.139> account<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:00.710> you'll<00:06:01.310> see
