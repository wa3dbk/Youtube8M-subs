00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.609
 I would not say that not pretty shitty 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 so expensive and of them we can 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.650
 to craft a in az or a ce 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.140

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 let's start choosing gizmos 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 cheap booze 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.289
 not to spend a lot of money saving 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.829
 above all by the way so let's 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.379
