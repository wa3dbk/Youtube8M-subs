pleated fondant would be to roll out a
long<00:00:40.260> strip<00:00:48.020> after<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.379> measured<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> height

long strip after I measured the height
of<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.520> cake<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.000> cut<00:00:51.780> my<00:00:51.960> Fond<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
of my cake I cut my Fond it to be the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.180 
of my cake I cut my Fond it to be the
same<00:00:53.129> height<00:00:54.140> next<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.260> cut<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.559> pleats<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
same height next I cut out my pleats and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
same height next I cut out my pleats and
for<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.030> decided<00:00:57.510> each<00:00:57.780> pleat<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.469> an

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for this I decided each pleat to be an

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.790 
for this I decided each pleat to be an
inch<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> 1/4<00:00:59.579> wide<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.469> prefer<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
inch and 1/4 wide I prefer to use a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
inch and 1/4 wide I prefer to use a
knife<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.460> cutting<00:01:02.670> my<00:01:02.879> pleats<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
knife when cutting my pleats because I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
knife when cutting my pleats because I
find<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> gives<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> better<00:01:04.830> edge<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.519> less

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
find it gives me a better edge and less

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.490 
find it gives me a better edge and less
drag<00:01:06.210> than<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.540> pizza<00:01:06.810> cutter
