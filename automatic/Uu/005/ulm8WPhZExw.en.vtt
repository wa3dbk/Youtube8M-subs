00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.270
 we are 4 stefano and tunde la pluri 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.020
 European champion of f 350 and two 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.010
 words with them about this race and the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.060
 first victorious car 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.710
 hi the first one but you did well too 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.360
 a little bad but at the end 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.360
 let's see the day 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990
 well 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.320
 mayor stefÃ no the team owner 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.920
 to shy away from explaining as a point 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.420
 these boats are fabula f 350 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.660
 good morning everyone is a varied one 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 by the guide lying in two engines 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.370
 timing of this artisan production 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.980
 category a 350 cc works for you a 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:53.620
 methanol direct intake 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:56.530
 a single propeller this boat in the case is 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.660
 in wood but currently there are boats 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.800
 much more competitive materials 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.460
 carbon fiber and kevlar one composites 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.490
 drift to facilitate the turn is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.560
 bari and that only turn to the left 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.780
 must have a break mark of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.380
 security protection in case of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.050
 In the event of an impact it is released and does not go to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.840
 create less damage to boats or 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.840
 Various riders are driving lying down like 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.310
 I said spy inside 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.810
 we come the throttle that is the accelerator 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 the steering wheel with one with the left hand 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.200
 holding the accelerator with your hand 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.200
 right always tight at the wheel 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.590
 we have contests for gps contests 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.900
 and telemetry that pressure gauge 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.910
 pressure that is vital to 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.090
 verify the correct functioning of the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.090
 engine 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.300
 to start this boat by having it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.060
 there is a direct drive without gears 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 pedal that manages the length of the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.910
 mufflers for increased lift or 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.010
 lower the maximum torque speed 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.970
 of the engine to make starting easier 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.220
 and curve is a coffin as I said yes 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 it only turns to one side and how you have it 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.390
 I saw the unfortunately so is the wave 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.520
 long you can't do inter because it is 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.880
 really dangerous makes you jump on 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.450
 before a second and many unlucky 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.450
 they ended up in the hospital
