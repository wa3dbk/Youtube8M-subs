00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.660 

so<00:00:09.600> when<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:09.930> started<00:00:10.440> working<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.130> her<00:00:11.370> fearful

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so when I started working on her fearful

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.060 
so when I started working on her fearful
symmetry<00:00:11.850> I<00:00:13.129> thought<00:00:14.129> well<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.349> will<00:00:16.349> I<00:00:16.860> will

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
symmetry I thought well I will I will

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.980 
symmetry I thought well I will I will
not<00:00:17.490> write<00:00:17.700> this<00:00:17.849> in<00:00:18.060> book<00:00:18.210> over<00:00:18.540> again<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.810> will

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
not write this in book over again I will

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.769 
not write this in book over again I will
I<00:00:19.500> will<00:00:19.529> set<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.040> and<00:00:20.279> teach<00:00:21.060> myself<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.540> write

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
I will set out and teach myself to write

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.029 
I will set out and teach myself to write
some<00:00:22.020> other<00:00:22.170> book<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:24.590> certainly<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.980> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
some other book and so certainly it is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.099 
some other book and so certainly it is
different<00:00:26.340> than<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.270> have<00:00:27.660> thought<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
different than I have I have thought a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
different than I have I have thought a
lot<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:30.090> technique<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> was

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
lot about the technique of what I was

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380 
lot about the technique of what I was
doing<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.439> i<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.970> things<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
doing but i think that the things you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
doing but i think that the things you
have<00:00:33.420> ser<00:00:34.019> essentially<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> things<00:00:35.129> you<00:00:35.309> have

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
have ser essentially the things you have

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
have ser essentially the things you have
to<00:00:35.640> say<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> can't<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.510> change<00:00:36.809> channels<00:00:37.290> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to say you can't just change channels on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.470 
to say you can't just change channels on
that<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> become<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> different<00:00:38.820> person

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.120 

the<00:00:42.480> title<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> book<00:00:43.500> her<00:00:43.800> fearful

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
the title of the book her fearful

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.360 
the title of the book her fearful
symmetry<00:00:44.900> comes<00:00:45.900> from<00:00:46.230> William<00:00:46.500> Blake's<00:00:46.770> poem

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
symmetry comes from William Blake's poem

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.890 
symmetry comes from William Blake's poem
which<00:00:47.670> starts<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.150> Tiger<00:00:48.510> Tiger<00:00:48.690> burning

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
which starts out Tiger Tiger burning

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.250 
which starts out Tiger Tiger burning
bright<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.830> forests<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.580> night<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
bright in the forests of the night and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
bright in the forests of the night and
I've<00:00:52.260> always<00:00:52.440> loved<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.830> poem<00:00:53.330> but<00:00:54.330> also<00:00:54.540> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I've always loved the poem but also I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.230 
I've always loved the poem but also I
was<00:00:55.140> looking<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> title<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.000> would

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
was looking for a title that would

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.030 
was looking for a title that would
express<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> doubling<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.800> twinning<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
express the doubling and twinning and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.370 
express the doubling and twinning and
opposites<00:01:02.880> that<00:01:03.240> are<00:01:03.390> essential<00:01:03.990> to<00:01:04.020> the

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
opposites that are essential to the

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.040 
opposites that are essential to the
theme<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.460> structure<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.120> book<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.630> had

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
theme and structure of the book I had

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.600 
theme and structure of the book I had
decided<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.740> needed<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.160> in<00:01:08.370> London

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
decided it needed to be in London

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
decided it needed to be in London
because<00:01:08.940> that's<00:01:09.360> where<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> extra<00:01:10.140> cool

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
because that's where the extra cool

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.930 
because that's where the extra cool
fantastic<00:01:11.070> cemetery<00:01:11.610> Highgate<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> then

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
fantastic cemetery Highgate was so then

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.460 
fantastic cemetery Highgate was so then
I<00:01:14.970> thought<00:01:15.270> okay<00:01:15.479> well<00:01:15.870> they're<00:01:16.020> Americans

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I thought okay well they're Americans

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
I thought okay well they're Americans
and<00:01:16.620> they<00:01:16.680> come<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> London<00:01:17.370> Allah<00:01:17.700> Henry

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and they come to London Allah Henry

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.609 
and they come to London Allah Henry
James<00:01:19.400> but<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:21.080> started<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.470> them

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
James but then i started with them

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
James but then i started with them
coming<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> london<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> didn't<00:01:23.880> seem

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
coming to london and that didn't seem

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
coming to london and that didn't seem
like<00:01:24.270> enough<00:01:24.660> you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> kept<00:01:25.590> going

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
like enough you know and I kept going

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
like enough you know and I kept going
back<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.729> until<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.300> got<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
back and back and back until I got to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.340 
back and back and back until I got to
the<00:01:27.869> woman<00:01:28.380> their<00:01:29.130> aunt<00:01:29.310> who<00:01:29.670> had<00:01:29.700> given<00:01:30.000> them

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the woman their aunt who had given them

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.480 
the woman their aunt who had given them
the<00:01:31.350> place<00:01:31.560> where<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.340> their

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the place where they call them their

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640 
the place where they call them their
flat<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.840> thought<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.440> that's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
flat and I thought well really that's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.320 
flat and I thought well really that's
the<00:01:34.860> beginning<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.300> you

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
the beginning you know when you when you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.109 
the beginning you know when you when you
get<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.979> when<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.460> woman<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
get to when you get to this woman and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.650 
get to when you get to this woman and
since<00:01:40.110> she<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.530> dying<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.150> interested

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
since she was dying and I was interested

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.919 
since she was dying and I was interested
in<00:01:42.720> her<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:43.729> was<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:45.270> she'll<00:01:45.780> just

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
in her I was like well okay she'll just

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.840 
in her I was like well okay she'll just
be<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> ghost<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.679> then<00:01:47.220> she<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
be a ghost and then she can be a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609 
be a ghost and then she can be a
character<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.539> even<00:01:49.050> though<00:01:49.140> she's<00:01:49.380> dead

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
character and even though she's dead

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.960 
character and even though she's dead
she'll<00:01:49.920> still<00:01:50.160> be<00:01:50.190> a<00:01:50.340> character<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:52.970> empathize

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
she'll still be a character I empathize

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
she'll still be a character I empathize
with<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.570> characters<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.350> various<00:01:55.679> ways

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
with all my characters in various ways

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
with all my characters in various ways
and<00:01:56.190> they<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.429> have<00:01:56.460> something<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.810> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and they all have something of me in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.850 
and they all have something of me in
them<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:02:00.110> understand<00:02:01.110> why<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
them and I understand why they do the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
them and I understand why they do the
things<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.570> even<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.289> know<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
things they do even if I don't know that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700 
things they do even if I don't know that
I<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.320> for<00:02:07.320> me<00:02:07.470> what

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
I would do that thing and for me what

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.710 
I would do that thing and for me what
what<00:02:08.220> fiction<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.060> about<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.660> of
