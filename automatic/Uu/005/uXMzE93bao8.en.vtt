only<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.060> they're<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.480> based<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
only know that they're there based on

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
only know that they're there based on
their<00:00:31.289> scat<00:00:31.619> based<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> feces<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.489> we

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
find in the area so we know that their

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.170 
find in the area so we know that their
populations<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.309> vulnerable<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> don't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
populations are vulnerable but we don't

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
little bit during a tease why do these

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.420 
little bit during a tease why do these
thing<00:00:45.440> there<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:47.010> theories

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
thing there are some different theories

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.270 
thing there are some different theories
one<00:00:48.390> possibility<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.020> greeting<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
one possibility is greeting or to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.850 
one possibility is greeting or to
solicit<00:00:50.579> food<00:00:51.110> they<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.260> sing<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.770> the

solicit food they also sing in the
morning<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.430> night<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
morning and at night so it could be a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
morning and at night so it could be a
way<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:55.610> hurting<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> groups<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> dogs

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
way of hurting like the groups of dogs

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.910 
way of hurting like the groups of dogs
kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> signaling<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> each<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.829> we

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
kind of signaling to each other are we

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.470 
kind of signaling to each other are we
all<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.730> kind<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> doing<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> roll

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
all here you know kind of doing a roll

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
all here you know kind of doing a roll
call<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> these<00:01:02.100> guys<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.489> important

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
call but these guys are important

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
call but these guys are important
because<00:01:03.030> they're<00:01:03.359> apex<00:01:03.809> predators<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.010> we

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
because they're apex predators so we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
because they're apex predators so we
have<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.760> apex<00:01:06.119> predator<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.840> Florida

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
have an apex predator here in Florida

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
have an apex predator here in Florida
that<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.619> concerned<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that we're very concerned about the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
that we're very concerned about the
Florida<00:01:09.150> panther<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> singing<00:01:10.860> dogs

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
Florida panther and so the singing dogs

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
Florida panther and so the singing dogs
are<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> great<00:01:11.490> ambassador<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.119> apex

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
are a great ambassador for apex

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
are a great ambassador for apex
predators<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.770> area<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
predators in this area because it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
predators in this area because it
enables<00:01:15.840> us<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> talk<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.439> things<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
enables us to talk about things that we

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
enables us to talk about things that we
can<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> help<00:01:17.990> predators<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
can do to help predators like the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
can do to help predators like the
Florida<00:01:19.500> panther<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.640> example<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
Florida panther so for example you can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
Florida panther so for example you can
buy<00:01:21.740> Florida<00:01:22.740> license<00:01:23.100> plates<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
buy Florida license plates that have the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
buy Florida license plates that have the
Panther<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> money<00:01:25.920> goes<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
Panther on it and all that money goes to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
Panther on it and all that money goes to
support<00:01:26.369> Panther<00:01:27.090> management<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.200> also

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
support Panther management you can also

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
support Panther management you can also
learn<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.619> wildlife<00:01:29.250> corridors<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:29.970> are

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
learn about wildlife corridors which are

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.200 
learn about wildlife corridors which are
really<00:01:30.299> important<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.829> Florida<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
really important in Florida because it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
really important in Florida because it
wildlife<00:01:33.869> quarters<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.560> space<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> land

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
wildlife quarters would be space of land

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
wildlife quarters would be space of land
that<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.549> connect<00:01:35.909> North<00:01:36.540> Florida<00:01:36.810> lands

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that would connect North Florida lands

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
that would connect North Florida lands
with<00:01:37.409> South<00:01:37.590> Florida<00:01:37.920> lands<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> Panthers

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
with South Florida lands so the Panthers

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
with South Florida lands so the Panthers
