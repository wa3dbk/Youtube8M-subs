00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 hi this is the video site team 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.990
 test.com today i will spend a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.699
 recipe which common we will spin and I 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.740
 go to test then it was cash 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 omelette with oatmeal or 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 can call it a species of galls is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 so I'm teaching you go I'll you the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.949
 do as is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 so you need 100 g of flakes 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.870
 oats then you take 8th and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 then down two hundred thousand liters of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.219
 milk So here then I did not try to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.890
 understand at the level of proportions and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.079
 cetera anyway it will be suitable 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.559
 obviously compared to your diet 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 your current diet so there you after 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.120
 so have taken so white 2 so that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.140
 makes about 180 grams of product 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 so you add two integers so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 after 2 or a single egg or a step from 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.830
 everything is as you want but where 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.060
 anyway I take it as it is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.510
 I say I 'm not thinking so here we go 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 I leave a little egg yolks for 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.030
 all a little more homogeneous then 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.479
 add more oatmeal and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.189
 I start a mixture went to shake 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.540
 will be ordinary to cider that's what I 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 do I did the morning before 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 to go to work so I can you 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.299
 to say that really not a complicated thing 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 to do so you need something that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.439
 came from a guy who brings me 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 protein carbohydrates especially is a little bit of 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.360
 lipids and fits and especially for those 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 which are especially taken mass that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.399
 wants to make a mass gain a little bit of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.399
 cleaner we'll say that take 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.740
 green delegates or else so there you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.780
 do you really have a thing and hiv-aids 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.549
 interesting at a high level of wan 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250
 to then add milk 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.869
 for the whole a little more fluid and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.189
 maybe crimping or a type at 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.070
 level of taste then that why like 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.960
 protein sousse and you take a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.590
 stove while normally you will have 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 previously preheated wasquehal case 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.209
 I added a drop of olive oil 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.410
 and then the talent with slogan 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.030
 it is to avoid from his glue to saada 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.470
 other stove but here at 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.230
 the extraordinary but I advise you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 to preheat the canvas before anyway 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.170
 then you add it all to 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.989
 inside so your stove you and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.760
 you can spread his uniform way 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.290
 and then you put it on a low heat then 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 obviously it is to be monitored has 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.239
 regularly if you do not want to 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.840
 to find something from crabs 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.660
 and so here we see that it's hard already there 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.180
 side there so that indicates we will be able 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.140
 return and cook each other the other 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.090
 side actually explodes tigalete that 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640
 obviously done as I am gifted rent 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 down I pay you t it's because 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 very serious so we see that up and 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.049
 it's hard 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.910
 I like my body it's a little bit 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.980
 hard these two parts and front and back 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.100
 middle is a little bit more 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.470
 long and that's what it therefore gives this 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.579
 so it's something like that at 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.049
 first sight that is not necessarily 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.720
 appetizing but hey it still takes 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.049
 49 g of protein 70 g of carbohydrates and 23 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.260
 grams of fat is about 685 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:37.670
 kcal so that's good appetite obviously 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.040
 so the verdict of this this kitchen of 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.230
 this recipe by the strong point 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.900
 so we have things really easy 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.819
 to prepare 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.489
 especially in the morning then people are 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.700
 fast and precisely this is the case 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.569
 takes leo any case it's 10 minutes a 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.609
 bag was fine it's actually 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.019
 it's the same bad to finish at especially 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.180
 with this quantity the to the a good 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.069
 source of carbohydrates and fiber that's 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.060
 it's important 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.069
 we realize it and obviously after 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.260
 the proteins 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.019
 good against obviously the point 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.540
 negative it's dry enough 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.190
 it's pretty dry so I was advised 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.760
 to add then on the jam 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.200
 honey for example and then we see 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.459
 it just allows you to balance this 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.460
 that he adds a little more of it if he or 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.520
 What good so that's to be tested 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.540
 obviously adapted and listen I tell you 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 see you soon for other tests 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.520
 be video test point like hi
