I'm<00:00:14.610> gonna<00:00:14.730> answer<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.150> question<00:00:15.570> whether<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
I'm gonna answer the question whether a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.279 
I'm gonna answer the question whether a
magnet<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:16.949> erase<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.520> flash<00:00:18.090> drive<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.900> SD

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
magnet can erase a flash drive and SD

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.269 
magnet can erase a flash drive and SD
card<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.279> SSD<00:00:20.730> or<00:00:21.289> solid-state<00:00:22.289> drive<00:00:22.920> as

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
card or an SSD or solid-state drive as

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880 
card or an SSD or solid-state drive as
we<00:00:23.430> call<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.230> simple<00:00:25.619> answer<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
we call them and the simple answer to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
we call them and the simple answer to
this<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.250> no<00:00:26.550> these<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.140> known

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
this is no these are all what are known

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.939 
this is no these are all what are known
as<00:00:28.380> solid<00:00:29.250> state<00:00:29.519> storage<00:00:30.330> devices<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.380> they

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
as solid state storage devices and they

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.180 
as solid state storage devices and they
do<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.579> magnetism<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.809> store<00:00:34.079> data<00:00:34.380> like

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
do not use magnetism to store data like

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.850 
do not use magnetism to store data like
a<00:00:35.370> floppy<00:00:35.670> drive<00:00:35.969> would<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.480> done<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
a floppy drive would have done or like a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
a floppy drive would have done or like a
conventional<00:00:38.520> hard<00:00:38.760> drive<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> they're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
conventional hard drive would so they're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.940 
conventional hard drive would so they're
not<00:00:41.160> affected<00:00:41.820> by<00:00:42.000> magnetism<00:00:42.710> basically<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
not affected by magnetism basically the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.580 
not affected by magnetism basically the
way<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.219> store<00:00:44.610> data<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.320> like

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
way they store data is they have like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
way they store data is they have like
millions<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.219> microscopic<00:00:47.579> diodes<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.629> them

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
millions of microscopic diodes in them

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
millions of microscopic diodes in them
and<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> diode<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> switch<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and a diode is just like a switch so the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229 
and a diode is just like a switch so the
diode<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.600> set<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:52.920> off<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
diode can be set to on or off and to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
diode can be set to on or off and to
represent<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.930> 0<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.469> 1<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.309> hold<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> data

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
represent a 0 or a 1 to hold the data

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
represent a 0 or a 1 to hold the data
and<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> equivalent<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and so it's kind of equivalent to the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
and so it's kind of equivalent to the
light<00:00:59.789> switch<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.420> wall<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.870> might<00:01:00.989> have

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
light switch on your wall you might have

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
light switch on your wall you might have
it<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.859> might<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.280> off<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:03.270> can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it on and you might have it off you can

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
it on and you might have it off you can
turn<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> hold<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> magnet<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
turn it on and hold a magnet up to it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
turn it on and hold a magnet up to it
nothing's<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.180> happen<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.689> light

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
nothing's going to happen to your light

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.710 
nothing's going to happen to your light
switch<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> turn<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:08.159> again

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
switch it's not going to turn off again

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
switch it's not going to turn off again
or<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.140> again<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> off<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.850> that's

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
or on again if you have it off so that's

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.870 
or on again if you have it off so that's
the<00:01:12.450> simple<00:01:12.810> answer<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the simple answer to this that you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600 
the simple answer to this that you
cannot<00:01:15.540> erase<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> solid-state<00:01:16.830> device<00:01:17.220> with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
cannot erase a solid-state device with

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.929 
cannot erase a solid-state device with
the<00:01:17.729> magnet<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.960> reason<00:01:19.439> I've<00:01:20.280> gone<00:01:20.640> into

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the magnet now the reason I've gone into

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.410 
the magnet now the reason I've gone into
this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.540> recently<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> bought<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
this is because recently I bought a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
this is because recently I bought a
tablet<00:01:24.420> device<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.920> cover<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> had<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
tablet device and the cover on it had a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.569 
tablet device and the cover on it had a
magnet<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> hold<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> cover<00:01:27.810> down<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
magnet to hold the cover down and it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.859 
magnet to hold the cover down and it
works<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:29.909> well<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.360> holds<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> cover

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
works really well it holds the cover

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.800 
works really well it holds the cover
down<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> thought<00:01:32.030> no<00:01:33.030> magnet

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
down really well but I thought no magnet

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
down really well but I thought no magnet
computer<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> doesn't<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.340> together

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
computer that doesn't really go together

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
computer that doesn't really go together
and<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> old<00:01:37.290> school<00:01:37.740> because

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and that's kind of old school because

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
and that's kind of old school because
tablets<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.150> least<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> tablet<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.920> had

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
tablets or at least a tablet I have had

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
tablets or at least a tablet I have had
all<00:01:41.540> solid-state<00:01:43.280> storage<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
all solid-state storage in it so it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
all solid-state storage in it so it
didn't<00:01:45.990> affect<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.250> some

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
didn't affect it now there are some

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
didn't affect it now there are some
tablet<00:01:48.390> PC's<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.610> hybrid<00:01:50.610> tablet<00:01:51.530> laptops

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that do have conventional hard drives in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.030 
that do have conventional hard drives in
them<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.350> affected<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
them and they could be affected by a
