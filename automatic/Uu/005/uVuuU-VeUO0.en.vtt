let's<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.759> off<00:01:44.880> by<00:01:45.119> doing<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> guitar

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
let's start off by doing a little guitar

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.030 
let's start off by doing a little guitar
work<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:47.369> still<00:01:47.640> doesn't<00:01:47.880> hurt<00:01:48.210> too

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
work it still doesn't hurt too

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.630 
work it still doesn't hurt too
to<00:01:49.550> get<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:49.940> tricky<00:01:50.390> with<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.600> angles

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
to get a little tricky with the angles

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.520 
to get a little tricky with the angles
to<00:01:52.640> get<00:01:52.820> as<00:01:53.060> much<00:01:53.360> guitar<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.080> can<00:01:54.290> into

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
to get as much guitar as you can into

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.370 
to get as much guitar as you can into
the<00:01:54.740> shot<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.220> still<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.380> microphones

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the shot and still get the microphones

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.710 
the shot and still get the microphones
close<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:59.080> we've<00:02:00.080> got<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.190> know<00:02:01.340> we<00:02:02.180> managed

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
close so we've got you know we managed

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.460 
close so we've got you know we managed
to<00:02:02.750> get<00:02:02.990> inside<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.040> arms<00:02:04.430> distance<00:02:04.880> which

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to get inside the arms distance which

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.919 
to get inside the arms distance which
from<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.590> guitar<00:02:06.890> must<00:02:07.190> be<00:02:07.370> just<00:02:07.520> 12<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.600> 18

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
from the guitar must be just 12 to 18

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.340 
from the guitar must be just 12 to 18
inches<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.850> distance<00:02:11.300> gives<00:02:12.170> us

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
inches that kind of a distance gives us

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:31.330 
inches that kind of a distance gives us
the<00:02:12.530> sound<00:02:12.830> something<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.400> this

ginger lang now you might wonder what

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.460 
ginger lang now you might wonder what
would<00:02:59.880> happen<00:03:00.060> without<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.570> lens<00:03:00.930> how<00:03:01.200> close

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
would happen without the lens how close

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.920 
would happen without the lens how close
are<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.740> really<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.000> take<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> long

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
are we really so if I just take the long

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.710 
are we really so if I just take the long
lens<00:03:04.170> off<00:03:04.440> pop<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.790> its<00:03:05.970> little<00:03:06.360> magnet

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
lens off pop it off of its little magnet

the q3 HD would see at this distance the

the q3 HD would see at this distance the
other<00:03:14.970> thing<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.210> might<00:03:15.420> notice<00:03:15.480> when<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.020> took

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
other thing you might notice when I took

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.470 
other thing you might notice when I took
the<00:03:16.530> lens<00:03:16.950> off<00:03:17.250> as<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> picture<00:03:17.880> got<00:03:18.120> brighter

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the lens off as the picture got brighter

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.530 
the lens off as the picture got brighter
I'm<00:03:19.140> not<00:03:19.290> sure<00:03:19.350> how<00:03:19.709> fast<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.340> q3<00:03:20.760> HD<00:03:21.150> corrects

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
I'm not sure how fast the q3 HD corrects

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.410 
I'm not sure how fast the q3 HD corrects
for<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.340> little<00:03:23.550> lens<00:03:23.880> which<00:03:24.150> only

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
for that but this little lens which only

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.170 
for that but this little lens which only
cost<00:03:24.720> twenty<00:03:25.080> bucks<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.620> worth<00:03:26.130> what<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.910> costs

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
cost twenty bucks is worth what it costs

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.860 
cost twenty bucks is worth what it costs
it's<00:03:28.020> not<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> miracle<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:29.130> optics<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.880> cuts

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
it's not a miracle of optics it cuts

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.930 
it's not a miracle of optics it cuts
down<00:03:31.050> on<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.290> light<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.739> gets<00:03:31.890> through<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.420 
corners at least a couple of them maybe
all<00:03:54.360> four<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.720> them<00:03:54.930> are<00:03:55.049> kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.380> dark<00:03:55.680> this

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
all four of them are kind of dark this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.720 
all four of them are kind of dark this
is<00:03:56.580> called<00:03:56.850> vignette<00:03:57.390> eng<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:58.769> happens

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
is called vignette eng and it happens

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.120 
is called vignette eng and it happens
when<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.060> lens<00:04:00.360> doesn't<00:04:00.930> match<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.680> sensor

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
when the lens doesn't match the sensor

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.390 
when the lens doesn't match the sensor
properly<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.350> we're<00:04:04.350> just<00:04:04.620> using<00:04:04.890> something

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
properly and we're just using something

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400 
properly and we're just using something
that<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.880> got<00:04:06.120> off<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.420> internet<00:04:06.690> after<00:04:07.080> all

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
that we got off the internet after all

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.039 
that we got off the internet after all
so<00:04:08.130> we're<00:04:08.820> not<00:04:08.970> surprised<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.780> doesn't

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
so we're not surprised that it doesn't

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.449 
so we're not surprised that it doesn't
work<00:04:10.170> perfectly<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.980> vignette

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
work perfectly but the the vignette

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.849 
work perfectly but the the vignette
ingos<00:04:14.790> away<00:04:15.090> when<00:04:15.299> we<00:04:15.420> take<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.959> lens<00:04:16.560> off

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
ingos away when we take the lens off

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.159 
ingos away when we take the lens off
notice<00:04:17.760> also<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.780> picture<00:04:19.140> gets

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
notice also that the picture gets

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.300 
notice also that the picture gets
brighter<00:04:19.709> or<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.780> picture<00:04:22.169> gets<00:04:22.200> more<00:04:22.770> clear

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
brighter or the picture gets more clear

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.700 
brighter or the picture gets more clear
perhaps<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> camera<00:04:24.450> compensates<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
perhaps the camera compensates for the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.880 
perhaps the camera compensates for the
lack<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.010> light<00:04:26.430> when<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:27.600> lens<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.320> by

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
lack of light when this lens is on by

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.120 
lack of light when this lens is on by
raising<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.490> ISO<00:04:30.180> by<00:04:30.450> raising<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.900> game<00:04:31.530> the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
raising the ISO by raising the game the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.790 
raising the ISO by raising the game the
digital<00:04:32.930> sensitivity<00:04:33.930> but<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.650> usually

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
digital sensitivity but that usually

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.670 
digital sensitivity but that usually
results<00:04:35.010> in<00:04:35.430> an<00:04:35.550> uglier<00:04:35.880> picture<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.990> usually

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
results in an uglier picture so usually

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.040 
results in an uglier picture so usually
things<00:04:37.979> will<00:04:38.130> look<00:04:38.250> better<00:04:38.640> either<00:04:39.510> brighter

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
things will look better either brighter

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.010 
things will look better either brighter
or<00:04:40.380> clear<00:04:40.770> or<00:04:41.070> both<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.540> lens<00:04:42.750> off

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
or clear or both with the lens off

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.310 
or clear or both with the lens off
they'll<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:44.040> be<00:04:44.310> too<00:04:44.940> close<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:46.020> want<00:04:46.260> them

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
they'll just be too close we want them

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.580 
they'll just be too close we want them
farther<00:04:46.590> away<00:04:46.940> well<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.780> not<00:04:49.020> sure<00:04:49.320> if<00:04:49.470> this

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
farther away well I'm not sure if this

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.500 
farther away well I'm not sure if this
is<00:04:49.650> really<00:04:49.979> going<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.880> solution<00:04:51.330> that

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
is really going to be a solution that

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.210 
is really going to be a solution that
I'm<00:04:51.690> going<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.870> use<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.110> lot<00:04:52.380> I'm<00:04:52.590> not<00:04:52.860> sure<00:04:53.100> if

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I'm going to use a lot I'm not sure if

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.730 
I'm going to use a lot I'm not sure if
it's<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.430> good<00:04:53.580> solution<00:04:53.910> for<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.590> but<00:04:55.590> it's

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
it's a good solution for you but it's

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.469 
it's a good solution for you but it's
something<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.130> think<00:04:56.160> about<00:04:56.430> its<00:04:56.850> twenty

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
something to think about its twenty

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.839 
something to think about its twenty
dollars<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:58.050> see<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:58.620> moving<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.610> camera

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
dollars to see if moving the camera
