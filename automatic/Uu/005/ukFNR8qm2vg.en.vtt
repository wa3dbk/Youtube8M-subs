00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
anyway this is getting a bit off-topic

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
anyway this is getting a bit off-topic
in<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.310> top<00:00:23.670> five<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> little<00:00:24.510> bit

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
in this top five it's a little bit

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
in this top five it's a little bit
different<00:00:24.779> because<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.320> couldn't<00:00:25.859> really<00:00:26.189> pick

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
different because I couldn't really pick

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
different because I couldn't really pick
which<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> most<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.380> which<00:00:28.500> one

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
which one I like the most in which one

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.730 
which one I like the most in which one
should<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.039> number<00:00:29.340> five<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.529> in

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
should be number five so this is not in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
should be number five so this is not in
any<00:00:32.099> particular<00:00:32.399> order<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.329> guess<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.690> could

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
any particular order I guess you could

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
any particular order I guess you could
say<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.520> it's<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.820> any<00:00:35.940> order<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
say it's not it's not in any order that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
say it's not it's not in any order that
goes<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> most<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
goes and I like this one the most and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
goes and I like this one the most and
this<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> least<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> list

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this one kind of the least on the list

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.920 
this one kind of the least on the list
it's<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.670> equally<00:00:42.570> an

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
it's just I like them all equally an

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's just I like them all equally an
equal<00:00:43.530> amount<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.250> yeah<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.360> bit

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
equal amount so yeah it's a little bit

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.490 
equal amount so yeah it's a little bit
different<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.930> wanna<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> little

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
different just wanna put a little

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860 
different just wanna put a little
disclaimer<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> front<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.879> uh<00:00:47.910> yeah

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

we can start with that
number<00:00:54.480> five<00:00:54.739> even<00:00:55.739> though<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
number five even though it's it's it's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just saw this bunny thing I was like

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
just saw this bunny thing I was like
this<00:01:35.729> thing's<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> great

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this thing's gonna be great

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.030 
this thing's gonna be great
let<00:01:36.840> me<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.200> guy<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.590> team<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
let me put this guy on my team and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
let me put this guy on my team and
that's<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> did<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.150> didn't<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.479> at

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that's what I did and I didn't get at

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's what I did and I didn't get at
the<00:01:39.780> best<00:01:40.049> ability<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.710> him<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the best ability for him I think the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
the best ability for him I think the
best<00:01:41.369> ability<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> huge<00:01:42.150> power<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.750> he's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
best ability is huge power because he's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
best ability is huge power because he's
becomes<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> massive<00:01:43.799> powerhouse<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
becomes a massive powerhouse with that I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.429 
becomes a massive powerhouse with that I
think<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> cheek<00:01:45.840> pouches<00:01:46.049> which<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
think about the cheek pouches which is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
think about the cheek pouches which is
actually<00:01:46.770> pretty<00:01:47.009> decent<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.850> recovery

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually pretty decent just for recovery

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
actually pretty decent just for recovery
but<00:01:48.360> uh<00:01:48.570> yeah<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.250> team<00:01:50.430> like

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
but uh yeah I put on my team like

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.859 
but uh yeah I put on my team like
straight<00:01:50.880> away<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.540> trying<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
straight away and I was just trying to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
straight away and I was just trying to
train<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.399> different

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
train them up just use some different

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
train them up just use some different
Pokemon<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> guess<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.479> usually<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
Pokemon I guess because usually the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
Pokemon I guess because usually the
generic<00:01:56.070> normal<00:01:56.399> type<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.909> goes

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
generic normal type kind of goes

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.899 
generic normal type kind of goes
unappreciated<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.799> underlooked<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.700> not

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
unappreciated to underlooked I'm not

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.219 
unappreciated to underlooked I'm not
really<00:02:00.060> used<00:02:00.360> even<00:02:00.630> though<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.049> be

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
really used even though they can be

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.039 
really used even though they can be
pretty<00:02:01.500> decent<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.939> um<00:02:03.360> diggersby<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
pretty decent so I think um diggersby is

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
pretty decent so I think um diggersby is
a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.350> more<00:02:04.469> popular<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.579> of

why<00:02:22.040> diggersby<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.940> number<00:02:23.300> five<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.070> yeah

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
why diggersby is number five and yeah

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.910 
why diggersby is number five and yeah
alright<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.330> claiming<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.110> number<00:02:27.320> four<00:02:27.710> spot

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
alright so claiming the number four spot

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.830 
alright so claiming the number four spot
or<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.550> least<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.000> would<00:02:29.300> be<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.720> number

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
or at least what would be the number

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320 
or at least what would be the number
four<00:02:30.110> spot<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.770> was<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.310> any<00:02:31.580> particular

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
four spot if this was in any particular

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.380 
four spot if this was in any particular
order<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.260> guess<00:02:33.470> would<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.210> this

order I guess would be just not in this
guy<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:36.140> guy's<00:02:36.320> an<00:02:36.440> absolute<00:02:36.860> beast<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.310> was

a pretty good design I'm not gonna say

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000 
a pretty good design I'm not gonna say
it<00:03:20.780> couldn't<00:03:21.050> be<00:03:21.170> better<00:03:21.410> because<00:03:21.800> it

for<00:03:55.670> some<00:03:55.820> reason<00:03:56.060> they<00:03:56.150> took<00:03:56.299> away<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
for some reason they took away the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.330 
for some reason they took away the
bubbles<00:03:57.290> around<00:03:57.440> his<00:03:57.709> neck<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:57.980> replaced<00:03:58.250> it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
bubbles around his neck and replaced it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.190 
bubbles around his neck and replaced it
with<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> tongue<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.060> don't<00:03:59.450> really<00:03:59.840> know<00:04:00.049> what

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
with the tongue I don't really know what

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.570 
with the tongue I don't really know what
they<00:04:00.290> were<00:04:00.380> thinking<00:04:00.500> there<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.250> doesn't<00:04:01.459> look

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580

terribly<00:04:02.150> bad<00:04:02.360> but<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:02.690> do<00:04:02.780> think<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.320> bubbles

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
terribly bad but I do think the bubbles

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
terribly bad but I do think the bubbles
would<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.860> looked<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.100> little<00:04:04.220> bit<00:04:04.370> better

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670

would have looked a little bit better
