agave when you put these two together in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.700 
agave when you put these two together in
various<00:04:06.360> ratios<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.440> anything

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
various ratios you can have anything

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.070 
various ratios you can have anything
from<00:04:07.920> cake<00:04:08.490> frosting<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.450> chocolate<00:04:09.900> sauce

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
and that would make actually a really

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.400 
and that would make actually a really
great<00:04:11.940> chocolate<00:04:12.390> sauce<00:04:12.570> for<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:12.960> ice<00:04:13.170> cream

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
great chocolate sauce for this ice cream
