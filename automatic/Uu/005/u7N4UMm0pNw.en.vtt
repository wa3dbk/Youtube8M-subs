00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
down below but I was basically just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
down below but I was basically just
going<00:01:07.620> for<00:01:07.800> some<00:01:07.979> super<00:01:08.460> loose<00:01:08.820> curls<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going for some super loose curls so I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.180 
going for some super loose curls so I
was<00:01:09.690> taking<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> bunch<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> random<00:01:10.560> sections

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
was taking a bunch of random sections

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.400 
was taking a bunch of random sections
and<00:01:11.570> curling<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.690> for<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.260> long

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
and curling them for not very long

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.250 
and curling them for not very long
probably<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.040> five<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.400> six<00:01:14.580> seconds<00:01:14.910> and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
probably like five or six seconds and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.330 
probably like five or six seconds and
after<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.290> finished<00:01:16.619> purling<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> section<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
after I finished purling the section I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.620 
after I finished purling the section I
would<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.610> tie<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.850> off<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> new

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
would just tie it off and get a new

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
would just tie it off and get a new
section<00:01:19.050> brush<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.410> out<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> same<00:01:20.310> I
