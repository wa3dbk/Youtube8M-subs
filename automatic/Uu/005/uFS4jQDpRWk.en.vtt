00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.250
 good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.980
 we are in a new video of how 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.040
 install the mod the best and most useful way 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.900
 of all minecraft 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.360
 and well you know him but 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.880
 I suppose there will be people who do not and that's why 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.220
 I make this video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 your mind is called so you do not know it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.019
 and so that he knows it because he will know what it is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.970
 a very simple very very useful but very 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.559
 useful that you have to go to what 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.110
 I have told you the link that I have below 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.360
 description just down here 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.100
 but ten seconds and you give it and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.590
 this will automatically be downloaded 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.160
 in this case, you have to do it because I have 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.360
 to go to percent up data 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.640
 let's go here to roaming minecraft bing and 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.520
 take us in kraft minecraft exxon 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.040
 only minecraft or minecraft points 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.730
 the medium put in w not only 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.420
 Minecraft 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.519
 that you are not going to eliminate us goal inf 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.980
 and we open the tumen items 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.040
 we hold everything together with control 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.040
 over here and we had it all here 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.270
 and our world is already installed and for 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 that does not know now what it is for and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.570
 what do you have for that I think that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.570
 It is the best and the most useful 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 let's open up on this map because not 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.230
 Well right now there is a difference 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.390
 here is the difference 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.030
 if you leave like that, nothing more than leaving the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.400
 side by side and you're done 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.110
 You have to do what I have 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 install it and now this here we have 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.970
 our inventory here has said that it is 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.620
 much more useful because we see that if all 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.160
 the elements are worth 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.580
 and there are things no other for 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.230
 example are the mushrooms this does not have 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.920
 this is not good nonsense 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.340
 Well, the normal minecraft difference does not 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.800
 has it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.370
 then it is compatible that is to say 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 used for 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.750
 for compatible and can be used to 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.430
 server modes flow them that 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.410
 say like the word edit 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 if you put these numbers that generate 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.380
 here 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.710
 and then change to creative survival 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.970
 with one click 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.690
 it makes the day go dark 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.720
 we are doing 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.930
 sunset in the day 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.250
 just giving those little ones 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.560
 little buttons 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.200
 and then I think that by giving him here he 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 save this and then we put here 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.370
 we give to load 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.370
 we keep things now 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.920
 we lose all things 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.720
 we lose them now 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.580
 we give to load and decorate all and for 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 that I think is the most useful each 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.819
 share your opinion and again you know 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.500
 how to be and how to use it makes 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.580
 take or want to see 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.320
 so I liked the favorites video and 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.140
 that little button on top of this 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.540
 video up here 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.129
 on that button giving to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.920
 a small click on another assumes nothing 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.569
 less a very big favor and you 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.480
 I will thank you so I hope you like it 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.390

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.260

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.260
 goodbye
