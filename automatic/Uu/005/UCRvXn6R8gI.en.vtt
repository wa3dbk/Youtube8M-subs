00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
like a guitar person laying a massage

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.250 
like a guitar person laying a massage
therapy<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.510> like

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.650 

my<00:01:06.950> son<00:01:07.160> has<00:01:07.280> become<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.550> huge<00:01:07.790> fan<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.120> massage

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
my son has become a huge fan of massage

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.330 
my son has become a huge fan of massage
since<00:01:09.380> his<00:01:09.500> treatment<00:01:09.920> hey<00:01:10.750> chemotherapy<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
since his treatment hey chemotherapy and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.800 
since his treatment hey chemotherapy and
so<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.610> think<00:01:14.410> there<00:01:15.410> are<00:01:15.560> two<00:01:15.770> week<00:01:15.950> cycles<00:01:16.430> and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
so I think there are two week cycles and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
so I think there are two week cycles and
four<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.930> them<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:20.720> are<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:21.230> going<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.770> a

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
four of them and so are we going for a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.030 
four of them and so are we going for a
week<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.400> get<00:01:23.000> treatment<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.890> would

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
week and get treatment and then I would

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.870 
week and get treatment and then I would
go<00:01:25.070> out<00:01:25.910> for<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.390> week<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.680> maybe<00:01:28.550> come

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
go out for a week and and maybe come

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.680 
go out for a week and and maybe come
back<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.300> depending<00:01:29.870> on<00:01:29.990> how<00:01:30.200> out<00:01:31.100> my<00:01:31.520> if<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.570> had

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
really mitigate a lot of the fear that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280 
really mitigate a lot of the fear that
we<00:02:16.190> had<00:02:16.400> certainly<00:02:17.209> we<00:02:17.600> couldn't<00:02:17.930> mitigate

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
we had certainly we couldn't mitigate

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.949 
we had certainly we couldn't mitigate
all<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.709> fear<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.100> we<00:02:19.220> had<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:20.780> could

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
all of the fear that we had but we could

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.690 
all of the fear that we had but we could
we<00:02:21.200> could<00:02:21.320> get<00:02:21.470> rid<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.680> some<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> doctors

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
we could get rid of some and the doctors

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970 
we could get rid of some and the doctors
and<00:02:22.970> nurses<00:02:23.030> were<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.320> instrumental<00:02:24.620> in

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
and nurses were really instrumental in

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.030 
and nurses were really instrumental in
doing<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> treatment

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
doing that and the I think the treatment

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.590 
doing that and the I think the treatment
that<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:28.400> chose<00:02:28.880> for<00:02:29.840> my<00:02:30.080> son<00:02:30.320> was<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:32.390> turns

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
that they chose for my son was it turns

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.240 
that they chose for my son was it turns
out<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:33.019> was<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.440> right<00:02:33.590> treatment<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.220> they

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
out it was the right treatment that they

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.520 
out it was the right treatment that they
chose<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.720> had<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> lot<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.050> faith<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.320> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
chose but we had a lot of faith in the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.340 
chose but we had a lot of faith in the
doctors<00:02:36.890> they<00:02:37.220> would<00:02:37.600> really<00:02:38.600> clue<00:02:38.810> us<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.140> on

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
doctors they would really clue us in on

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.229 
doctors they would really clue us in on
on<00:02:39.650> what<00:02:39.950> they<00:02:40.130> were<00:02:40.190> thinking<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.880> how<00:02:41.030> they

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
on what they were thinking and how they

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.840 
on what they were thinking and how they
were<00:02:41.300> thinking<00:02:41.570> about<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.160> allowed<00:02:43.640> us<00:02:43.670> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.449 
only were the most qualified in the city
but<00:03:11.420> also<00:03:11.450> they<00:03:12.260> had<00:03:12.379> a<00:03:12.409> sincere<00:03:12.890> they<00:03:13.189> cared

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
but also they had a sincere they cared

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.119 
but also they had a sincere they cared
they<00:03:13.700> were<00:03:14.209> sincere<00:03:14.840> they<00:03:14.870> met<00:03:15.650> with<00:03:15.799> Avery

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
they spoke with Avery and really the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.440 
they spoke with Avery and really the
whole<00:03:21.200> package<00:03:21.769> was<00:03:21.920> important<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> us<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.760> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
whole package was important to us and I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.569 
whole package was important to us and I
think<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:24.200> Morgan<00:03:24.590> Stanley<00:03:24.769> Children's

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
think that at Morgan Stanley Children's

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.280 
think that at Morgan Stanley Children's
Hospital<00:03:26.000> we<00:03:26.659> were<00:03:26.840> getting<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.200> whole

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
Hospital we were getting the whole

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.190 
Hospital we were getting the whole
package<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.939> it<00:03:29.030> was<00:03:29.150> two<00:03:29.720> or<00:03:29.900> three

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
package I think it was two or three

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.530 
package I think it was two or three
months<00:03:30.319> right<00:03:30.859> two<00:03:31.430> or<00:03:31.609> three<00:03:31.640> months<00:03:31.909> after

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
months right two or three months after

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.539 
months right two or three months after

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
your trip after my treatment I played
