00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.109
 the highest 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.549
 but in my opinion 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.999
 for 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.869

 however, this is the case 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.399
 she is a game that can hurt 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:27.519
 but not so much good 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.410

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 so now I can work 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.609

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.039
 it's a bit like that 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.860
 I wrote a post-infarction no I didn't expect it that way 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 I knew 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.139
 I will reject a lot 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.139
 and had this feature of 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.229
 his game is based on a 2 maximum 3 I knew that 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.490
 but mine on the contrary 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.770
 so obviously 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.059
 one of the two heroes 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.199
 to win against the other night 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.900

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900

 some say no though 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.569
 this 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.009
 totally different than playing seriously 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.059
 in short, the weather says 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.059
 because there are not so many in the evening 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.860

 stay all the time so here is the screen red 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.159
 so he was used to it 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.229
 game indexes every day 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.479

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.479
 it's up to me to get up 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.930

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080
 this difficulty 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.099
 but let's talk about habit 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.099
 it's not something that won't let you play 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.360

 not only 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:47.629
 you can understand 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.930
 there is the perception of your body and field 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.520

 more to the flags up there 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.889
 and really be careful what it is 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.969
 different conditions 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.979
 it is better to play san siro stadium

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.860
