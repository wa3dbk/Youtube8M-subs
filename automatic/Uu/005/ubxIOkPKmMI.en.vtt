Dukes<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> day<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.259> mod<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
Dukes which is like a day one mod I

Dukes which is like a day one mod I
suppose<00:01:20.040> by<00:01:20.580> Giants

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.970 

so<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.170> jump<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.830> really

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
so if we just jump out we don't really

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.420 
so if we just jump out we don't really
need<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> trance<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
need the trance now we just go to the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.810 
need the trance now we just go to the
front<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> stand<00:01:31.050> near<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> levers<00:01:31.820> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
front here and stand near the levers and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
front here and stand near the levers and
you<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.440> up<00:01:34.500> close<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:35.640> spots

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you get right up close like that spots

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
you get right up close like that spots
close<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.720> get

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
close I can get

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
close I can get
it's<00:01:38.280> N<00:01:38.730> and<00:01:39.300> J<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> lead<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's N and J is for that lead it's for

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's N and J is for that lead it's for
that<00:01:40.860> Dorset<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.820> those<00:01:41.910> not

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that Dorset and it's for those not

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.000 
that Dorset and it's for those not
leavin<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.690> see<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> leave<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
leavin as you can see the leave is to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.760 
leavin as you can see the leave is to
actually<00:01:44.190> move<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.940> very<00:01:45.150> very<00:01:45.300> cool

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
actually move which is very very cool

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.500 
actually move which is very very cool
and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.100> M<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.610> K<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> next<00:01:48.360> one

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
and then is M and K for the next one

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.500 
and then is M and K for the next one
it's<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.110> nicely<00:01:49.290> animated<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:51.120> all<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
it's all nicely animated it's all really

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.870 
it's all nicely animated it's all really
nice<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.080> animate<00:01:52.440> if<00:01:52.620> I<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.920> stand<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.370> just

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
nice to animate if I can stand back just

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.390 
nice to animate if I can stand back just
a<00:01:53.940> little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.300> further<00:01:54.980> just<00:01:55.980> like<00:01:56.190> the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
a little bit further just like the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.730 
a little bit further just like the
lights<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.650> cool<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.380> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
lights so it's all really cool and there

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.420 
lights so it's all really cool and there
even<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:03.620> sign<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.650> if<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.010> can<00:02:05.250> get

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
even the little sign that if I can get

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910

means to attach them to the trailer
itself<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.490> idea<00:03:00.000> behind<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.390> trailer

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
itself now the idea behind this trailer

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.710 
itself now the idea behind this trailer
is<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:00.990> safer<00:03:01.670> faster<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.630> around

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
is it's safer faster and just all around

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.900 
is it's safer faster and just all around
better<00:03:04.080> than<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> normal<00:03:05.069> party<00:03:05.610> trailer

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
better than a normal party trailer

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.570 
better than a normal party trailer
because<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> side<00:03:07.230> doors<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.340> well<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
because of the side doors and well the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.220 
because of the side doors and well the
idea<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.090> side<00:03:09.270> doors<00:03:09.480> easy<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.870> start<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
idea of the side doors easy to start the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.830 
idea of the side doors easy to start the
bells<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.340> quickly<00:03:11.840> relatively

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
bells you know quickly relatively

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.430 
bells you know quickly relatively
roughly<00:03:13.290> Mabini<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.190> suppose<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.959> big

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
roughly Mabini I suppose and the big

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.320 
roughly Mabini I suppose and the big
doors<00:03:16.709> will<00:03:16.890> come<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.190> squash<00:03:18.030> them<00:03:18.209> all

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
doors will come up squash them all

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.660 
doors will come up squash them all
together<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.230> keep<00:03:19.709> them<00:03:19.830> secure<00:03:20.160> seed<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.550> to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
together and keep them secure seed up to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.520 
together and keep them secure seed up to
spend<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.180> strapping<00:03:21.750> them<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:22.050> and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
spend a you strapping them down and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.030 
spend a you strapping them down and
being<00:03:23.459> really<00:03:23.700> neatly<00:03:23.910> stacking<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.860> great

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
being really neatly stacking it's great

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.020 
being really neatly stacking it's great
idea<00:03:26.340> I'd<00:03:26.459> love<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.959> now<00:03:27.959> over<00:03:28.739> there<00:03:29.030> there's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
idea I'd love one now over there there's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.570 
idea I'd love one now over there there's
one<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> made<00:03:30.450> earlier<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:32.220> obviously<00:03:32.489> not

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
one I made earlier it's obviously not

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.570 
one I made earlier it's obviously not
the<00:03:32.640> best<00:03:32.959> three<00:03:33.959> hi<00:03:34.170> I'm<00:03:35.040> done<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.489> very

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
the best three hi I'm done it very

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.130 
the best three hi I'm done it very
neatly<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.060> could<00:03:36.209> easily<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.870> squash

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
neatly you could easily have a squash

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.259 
neatly you could easily have a squash
them<00:03:37.350> right<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.709> viewed<00:03:37.890> up<00:03:37.980> another<00:03:38.269> another

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
them right up viewed up another another

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.530 
them right up viewed up another another
two<00:03:39.510> stacks<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.989> three<00:03:42.050> satisfy<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.110> tractor

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
two stacks of three satisfy the tractor

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.270 
two stacks of three satisfy the tractor
got<00:03:45.959> my<00:03:46.020> favorite<00:03:46.260> one<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.680> my<00:03:46.770> favorite<00:03:47.099> cases

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
got my favorite one of my favorite cases

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.350 
got my favorite one of my favorite cases
there<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.860> stand<00:03:50.190> about<00:03:50.760> here

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
there so if I stand about here

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.420 
there so if I stand about here
I<00:03:51.650> think<00:03:52.650> it's<00:03:52.769> GA<00:03:53.040> for<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.459> note<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:55.370> al<00:03:56.370> for

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
I think it's GA for this note is al for

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.000 
I think it's GA for this note is al for
this<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:56.970> no<00:03:57.930> okay

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
this one no okay

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.940 
this one no okay
I<00:03:59.989> think<00:04:00.989> probably<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.319> best<00:04:01.500> idea<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.800> try

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
I think probably the best idea is try

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.699 
I think probably the best idea is try
and<00:04:02.010> sink<00:04:02.250> them<00:04:02.340> all<00:04:02.489> together<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.470> it's

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
and sink them all together so so it's

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.320 
and sink them all together so so it's
knj<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.400> then<00:04:08.580> you're<00:04:08.670> ready<00:04:08.790> I'll<00:04:09.000> squash

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
knj and then you're ready I'll squash

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.610 
knj and then you're ready I'll squash
them<00:04:09.540> all<00:04:09.720> you'll<00:04:10.019> remember<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:10.530> my

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
them all you'll remember this for my

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.490 
them all you'll remember this for my
first<00:04:10.800> 13<00:04:11.599> that's<00:04:12.599> them<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:12.989> squash<00:04:13.290> together

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
first 13 that's them all squash together

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.650 
first 13 that's them all squash together
but<00:04:13.890> they're<00:04:14.069> not<00:04:14.160> happy<00:04:14.430> about<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.879> as<00:04:15.450> you

a<00:04:50.110> good<00:04:50.229> idea<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.280> mr<00:04:51.580> mod<00:04:51.819> it<00:04:51.970> worked

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
a good idea on the mr mod it worked

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.020 
a good idea on the mr mod it worked
really<00:04:52.389> well<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:54.190> they<00:04:54.340> were<00:04:54.430> fantastically

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
really well but they were fantastically

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.129 
really well but they were fantastically
mr<00:04:55.479> mod

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.570 

I<00:04:59.229> never<00:04:59.800> letting<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.129> pressure<00:05:00.340> off<00:05:00.490> a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
I never letting the pressure off a

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.459 
I never letting the pressure off a
little<00:05:00.729> bit<00:05:00.879> would<00:05:01.030> help<00:05:01.210> anything<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.289> don't

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
little bit would help anything I don't

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.020 
little bit would help anything I don't
like<00:05:02.620> about<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:03.039> that<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.699> lack<00:05:03.879> of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
like about is that just the lack of

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.429 
like about is that just the lack of
visibility<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:08.340> hmm<00:05:09.779> no<00:05:10.779> that's<00:05:11.020> making<00:05:11.349> it

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
visibility so hmm no that's making it

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:20.060 
visibility so hmm no that's making it
worse

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.400 

they<00:05:20.730> should<00:05:20.970> be<00:05:21.090> attached

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
they should be attached

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.330 
they should be attached
they're<00:05:24.100> not<00:05:24.220> are<00:05:24.520> they<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.800> order<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.190> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
they're not are they so the order of the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.730 
they're not are they so the order of the
mod<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.610> great<00:05:27.910> it's<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.780> FS<00:05:29.050> 15<00:05:29.410> valves

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
mod is great it's just the FS 15 valves

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.350 
mod is great it's just the FS 15 valves
that<00:05:29.860> market<00:05:30.310> don't<00:05:30.820> lie<00:05:30.910> being<00:05:31.150> squashed

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
that market don't lie being squashed

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.710 
that market don't lie being squashed
together<00:05:32.220> whereas<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.340> mr<00:05:33.640> mod<00:05:33.880> when<00:05:34.450> I<00:05:34.510> first

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
together whereas the mr mod when I first

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.410 
together whereas the mr mod when I first
thirteen<00:05:35.050> was<00:05:35.200> superior<00:05:35.530> yeah<00:05:36.520> there's<00:05:37.330> a

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
thirteen was superior yeah there's a

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.950 
thirteen was superior yeah there's a
fight

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.280 

it's<00:05:43.440> really<00:05:43.770> I'm<00:05:43.860> feeling<00:05:44.190> these<00:05:44.310> bales<00:05:45.290> you

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
it's really I'm feeling these bales you

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.660 
it's really I'm feeling these bales you
know<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.410> lot<00:05:46.620> there's<00:05:46.830> not<00:05:46.919> that<00:05:47.040> many

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.240 

I<00:05:49.760> suppose<00:05:50.420> an<00:05:50.540> acceptable<00:05:51.050> speed<00:05:51.320> for<00:05:51.920> in

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
I suppose an acceptable speed for in

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.980 
I suppose an acceptable speed for in
real<00:05:52.490> life<00:05:52.670> for<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:52.970> going<00:05:53.660> up<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.840> hill<00:05:53.930> like

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
real life for the going up a hill like

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:03.830 
real life for the going up a hill like
this<00:05:54.140> and<00:05:54.560> pulling<00:05:54.950> this<00:05:55.130> load

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.750 

and<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:04.470> they're<00:06:04.620> attached<00:06:04.920> now<00:06:05.160> instead<00:06:05.700> of

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
and so they're attached now instead of

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.780 
and so they're attached now instead of
been<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.120> air<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.830> think<00:06:07.830> actually<00:06:08.280> I<00:06:08.580> might

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
been in the air I think actually I might

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.610 
been in the air I think actually I might
have<00:06:08.940> done<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.270> done<00:06:09.720> it<00:06:09.810> wrong<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:10.230> you<00:06:10.290> should

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
have done it done it wrong so you should

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.159 
have done it done it wrong so you should
attach<00:06:11.130> them<00:06:11.490> should<00:06:12.419> use<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.750> doors<00:06:12.930> to

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
attach them should use the doors to

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.850 
attach them should use the doors to
squash<00:06:13.410> them<00:06:13.590> together<00:06:13.740> at<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.760> doors<00:06:15.000> down

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
squash them together at the doors down

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.960 
squash them together at the doors down
and<00:06:16.860> there<00:06:17.010> maybe<00:06:17.130> lift<00:06:17.430> him<00:06:17.580> up

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.790 

I'm<00:06:22.420> just<00:06:22.630> like<00:06:22.810> squash<00:06:23.110> them<00:06:23.320> up<00:06:23.410> like<00:06:23.590> that

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
I'm just like squash them up like that

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.000 
I'm just like squash them up like that
so<00:06:24.010> they're<00:06:24.130> not<00:06:24.220> completely<00:06:24.880> up<00:06:25.710> but<00:06:26.710> just

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
so they're not completely up but just

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:33.780 
so they're not completely up but just
enough<00:06:27.310> so<00:06:27.520> that<00:06:27.550> don't<00:06:28.320> paint<00:06:29.320> you<00:06:29.530> like<00:06:32.790> that

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
enough so that don't paint you like that

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.320 
enough so that don't paint you like that
I<00:06:35.340> think<00:06:36.340> there's<00:06:36.550> a<00:06:36.580> very<00:06:36.790> fine<00:06:36.970> line<00:06:37.180> between

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
I think there's a very fine line between

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.970 
I think there's a very fine line between
them<00:06:37.600> absolutely<00:06:37.990> hating<00:06:38.470> what<00:06:39.190> you're<00:06:39.340> doing

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
them absolutely hating what you're doing

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.650 
them absolutely hating what you're doing
it<00:06:41.980> will<00:06:42.100> be<00:06:42.220> nice<00:06:42.340> if<00:06:42.550> it<00:06:42.670> did<00:06:43.240> work<00:06:43.360> a<00:06:43.540> bit

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
it will be nice if it did work a bit

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.160 
it will be nice if it did work a bit
better

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
better

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.230 
better
