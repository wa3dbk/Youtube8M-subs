bit more about the cars design so one of

bit more about the cars design so one of
the<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> key<00:01:05.549> features<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.260> current

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the one of the key features on current

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
the one of the key features on current
cube<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> next<00:01:07.979> cube<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.640> symmetry

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
cube and the next cube is a symmetry

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
cube and the next cube is a symmetry
what<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> symmetry<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.799> doing<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
what is a symmetry why are we doing it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
what is a symmetry why are we doing it
well<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> reason<00:01:12.030> why<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:12.990> see

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
well the reason why is as you can see

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
well the reason why is as you can see
here<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> right-hand<00:01:14.189> drive<00:01:14.549> version

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
here on this right-hand drive version

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
here on this right-hand drive version
when<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.080> driver<00:01:16.290> looks<00:01:16.590> over<00:01:16.860> their

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
when your driver looks over their

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.980 
when your driver looks over their
shoulder<00:01:17.430> they're<00:01:18.030> looking<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.750> way

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
shoulder they're looking out this way

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
shoulder they're looking out this way
and<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> small<00:01:19.979> pillar<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> they

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and they have a small pillar and they

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
and they have a small pillar and they
can<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.630> clearly<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.170> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
can see out very clearly and it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
can see out very clearly and it's
expressed<00:01:22.920> by<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> glass<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:24.540> cannot<00:01:24.869> see

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
expressed by the glass they cannot see

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
expressed by the glass they cannot see
here<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.400> straight<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
here they don't look straight back so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
here they don't look straight back so
we're<00:01:27.840> able<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.409> increase<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.189> space<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
we're able to increase that space and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.560 
we're able to increase that space and
add<00:01:30.689> storage<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.490> functional<00:01:33.119> items

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
add storage and other functional items

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
add storage and other functional items
in<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.110> area<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.920> very<00:01:35.100> weel<00:01:35.460> oriented<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
in that area it's very weel oriented so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.410 
in that area it's very weel oriented so
the<00:01:36.689> tires<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> corners<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
the tires are out at the corners and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.080 
the tires are out at the corners and
maybe<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.750> best<00:01:39.930> feature<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.280> glass<00:01:41.729> roof

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
maybe the best feature is the glass roof

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.000 
maybe the best feature is the glass roof
which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> very<00:01:43.170> open<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.340> also

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
which is very open but also

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.090 
which is very open but also
as<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.790> Shoji<00:01:47.180> screen<00:01:47.860> representing<00:01:48.860> some

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
as the Shoji screen representing some

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.600 
as the Shoji screen representing some
Japanese<00:01:49.580> DNA<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:51.650> also<00:01:52.010> if<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.280> Sun<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.580> too

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
Japanese DNA and also if the Sun is too

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.530 
Japanese DNA and also if the Sun is too
