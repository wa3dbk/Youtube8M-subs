seeing something further down the road

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.370 
seeing something further down the road
that's<00:00:27.480> even<00:00:27.660> more<00:00:27.689> troubling<00:00:28.109> than<00:00:28.170> you're

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that's even more troubling than you're

sterling was not meant for this month

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.060

they<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> quarter<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.590> comment<00:00:34.920> about

they even this quarter my comment about

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
they even this quarter my comment about
sterling<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> big<00:00:35.940> picture<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.480> what's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
sterling was the big picture of what's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.740 
sterling was the big picture of what's
happening<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> UK<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> said<00:00:38.129> was

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
happening in the UK and what I said was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
happening in the UK and what I said was
that<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.050> North<00:00:40.260> Sea<00:00:40.530> oil<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.040> drying<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that the North Sea oil is drying up and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
that the North Sea oil is drying up and
that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> City<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> London<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.230> drying<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that the City of London is drying up and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
that the City of London is drying up and
I<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.120> UK<00:00:45.480> has<00:00:45.750> any

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
I don't see that the UK has any

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.650 
I don't see that the UK has any
industries<00:00:46.620> which<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.039> replace<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.180> loss<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
industries which can replace the loss of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
industries which can replace the loss of
income<00:00:48.870> from<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> North<00:00:49.860> Sea<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> City

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
income from the North Sea and the City

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
income from the North Sea and the City
of<00:00:50.850> London<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.420> therefore<00:00:51.960> sterling<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
of London and therefore sterling is a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
of London and therefore sterling is a
bad<00:00:53.219> place<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> invest<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> next<00:00:54.780> several

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
bad place to invest for the next several

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
bad place to invest for the next several
years<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.680> hope<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.180> maybe<00:00:57.390> can

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
years I hope that one of you maybe can

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
years I hope that one of you maybe can
tell<00:00:57.870> me<00:00:58.050> something<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
tell me something that's going to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
tell me something that's going to
replace<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> North<00:01:00.000> Sea<00:01:00.210> oil<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> City<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
replace the North Sea oil or the City of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
replace the North Sea oil or the City of
London<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.920> UK<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
London for the UK because it will be a

and and the same goes for gold well to

the Royal Bank of scholars one yes yes
but<00:01:50.880> they're<00:01:51.060> making<00:01:51.360> my<00:01:51.479> point<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> oil

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
but they're making my point the oil

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
but they're making my point the oil
decline<00:01:52.500> has<00:01:52.619> been<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.579> time

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
decline has been going on for some time

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
decline has been going on for some time
and<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.509> worse<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.290> Royal

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it's going to get worse if the Royal

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
and it's going to get worse if the Royal
Bank<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> Scotland<00:01:56.040> thinks<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> oil

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Bank of Scotland thinks that the oil

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
Bank of Scotland thinks that the oil
production<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.380> rise<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> North

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.490 
production is going to rise in the North
Sea<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:01.170> should<00:02:01.350> buy

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

sterling I think it's going to continue

sterling I think it's going to continue
to<00:02:03.750> decline<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> has<00:02:04.619> been<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.070> time

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
to decline as it has been for some time

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.459 
to decline as it has been for some time
what's<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> happen<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> oil<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.200> year

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
what's going to happen to oil this year

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.160 
what's going to happen to oil this year
again<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> market

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
again you know I'm not a market

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.770 
again you know I'm not a market
or<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> traitor<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.390> IEA

recently<00:02:13.470> came<00:02:13.680> out<00:02:13.740> with<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.130> study<00:02:14.459> which

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
recently came out with a study which

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
recently came out with a study which
showed<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> world's<00:02:15.660> oil<00:02:15.870> reserves<00:02:16.080> are

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
showed that the world's oil reserves are

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.890 
showed that the world's oil reserves are
declining<00:02:17.010> at<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.340> rate<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.760> six<00:02:18.390> point<00:02:18.660> seven

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300 
declining at the rate of six point seven
percent<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.500> year<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.069> after

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
percent a year and that's after

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.180 
percent a year and that's after
discoveries<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.750> Louisa<00:02:22.290> doesn't<00:02:22.860> take<00:02:22.980> much

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you can figure out in 15 years is not

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
you can figure out in 15 years is not
going<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.200> any<00:02:25.319> oil<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.709> any<00:02:25.980> price<00:02:26.280> unless

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
going to be any oil at any price unless

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
going to be any oil at any price unless
somebody<00:02:27.090> finds<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> lot<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.900> oil<00:02:28.050> very<00:02:28.350> quickly

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
somebody finds a lot of oil very quickly

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220 
somebody finds a lot of oil very quickly
I<00:02:28.980> bought<00:02:29.520> more<00:02:29.760> oil<00:02:30.030> recently<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.840> energy

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
I bought more oil recently more energy

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.350 
I bought more oil recently more energy
recently<00:02:31.709> doesn't<00:02:32.520> mean<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> won't<00:02:32.850> go<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> 30

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
recently doesn't mean it won't go to 30

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.470 
recently doesn't mean it won't go to 30
or<00:02:33.600> 20<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.950> do<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.030> known

and as far as gold is concerned I bought
some<00:02:44.670> more<00:02:44.819> gold<00:02:45.000> today<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.110> who<00:02:46.380> knows<00:02:46.560> what

go<00:02:47.010> goes<00:02:47.280> down<00:02:47.610> I'll<00:02:47.880> buy<00:02:48.450> more<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.930> goes<00:02:49.110> up

go goes down I'll buy more if it goes up

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.190 
go goes down I'll buy more if it goes up
I'll<00:02:49.530> buy<00:02:49.739> more<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.519> price<00:02:51.450> forecast<00:02:51.989> for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
I'll buy more but a price forecast for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.300 
I'll buy more but a price forecast for

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
this year I wish I were that smart Neil

this year I wish I were that smart Neil
Diamond<00:02:56.310> ya<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> certainly<00:02:57.959> share<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
Diamond ya know I certainly share the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.320 
Diamond ya know I certainly share the
views<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.750> on<00:03:00.750> oil<00:03:01.080> clearly<00:03:02.069> at<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.310> new<00:03:03.150> oil

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
views on on oil clearly at the new oil

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.120 
views on on oil clearly at the new oil
is<00:03:03.540> being<00:03:03.569> found<00:03:03.989> substantially<00:03:04.650> higher<00:03:04.860> I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
is being found substantially higher I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.160 
is being found substantially higher I
mean<00:03:05.459> we<00:03:05.610> would<00:03:05.760> argue<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.060> finding<00:03:06.840> oil<00:03:06.930> in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
mean we would argue that finding oil in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.750 
mean we would argue that finding oil in
Canada<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.680> waste<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.980> time<00:03:08.040> because<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Canada is a waste of time because the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.880 
Canada is a waste of time because the
energy<00:03:08.940> required<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> turn<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.350> into<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.650> is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
energy required to turn it into all is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.890 
energy required to turn it into all is
too<00:03:11.100> high<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.940> know<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> need<00:03:12.360> very<00:03:12.600> very

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
too high so you know you need very very

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.140 
too high so you know you need very very
high<00:03:13.080> levels<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.530> oil<00:03:13.739> yeah<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.549> suppose<00:03:14.970> Jim

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
high levels of oil yeah I suppose Jim

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.840 
high levels of oil yeah I suppose Jim
might<00:03:15.359> my<00:03:15.630> my<00:03:16.470> issue<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.370> gold<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
might my my issue with with gold and

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.949 
might my my issue with with gold and
I've<00:03:17.940> interesting<00:03:18.359> your<00:03:18.450> dynamics<00:03:18.840> from

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
I've interesting your dynamics from

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.690 
I've interesting your dynamics from
another<00:03:19.200> perspective<00:03:19.500> as<00:03:19.859> people<00:03:20.190> see<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.549> as

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
another perspective as people see it as

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.750 
another perspective as people see it as
a<00:03:20.730> people<00:03:21.540> see<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> hedge<00:03:22.760> against

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
a people see it as a hedge against

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.449 
a people see it as a hedge against
inflation<00:03:23.850> which<00:03:24.510> may<00:03:24.859> eventually<00:03:25.859> turn<00:03:26.310> up

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
inflation which may eventually turn up

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.069 
inflation which may eventually turn up
under<00:03:26.700> my<00:03:26.850> scenario<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.420> about<00:03:27.630> twenty<00:03:28.019> eleven

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
under my scenario in about twenty eleven

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.020 
under my scenario in about twenty eleven
or<00:03:28.440> twenty<00:03:28.799> twelve<00:03:29.040> once<00:03:29.370> we've<00:03:29.609> worked<00:03:29.850> our

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
or twenty twelve once we've worked our

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.020 
or twenty twelve once we've worked our
way<00:03:30.060> through<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:31.739> debt<00:03:32.010> deflation<00:03:32.280> do

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
way through this this debt deflation do

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.900 
way through this this debt deflation do
you<00:03:33.600> think<00:03:33.780> people<00:03:34.079> are<00:03:34.230> too<00:03:34.829> carried<00:03:35.340> away<00:03:35.430> by

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you think people are too carried away by

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.120 
you think people are too carried away by
buying<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:36.780> buying<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.350> inflation<00:03:37.859> hedge

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
buying but buying the inflation hedge

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.300 
buying but buying the inflation hedge
now<00:03:38.959> or<00:03:39.959> are<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.260> buying<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.829> some<00:03:41.010> extent

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
now or are you buying it to some extent

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.710 
now or are you buying it to some extent
to<00:03:41.400> hate<00:03:41.549> yourself<00:03:41.700> against<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.329> dollar<00:03:42.540> as

higher inflation or 2010 or 2012 for all
I<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.859> do<00:03:59.010> know<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.400> we've<00:03:59.700> never

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
I know but I do know that we've never

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.870 
I know but I do know that we've never

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
central bank and every government in the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.680 
central bank and every government in the
world<00:04:04.769> is<00:04:05.160> printing<00:04:05.549> money<00:04:05.700> as<00:04:05.940> fast<00:04:05.970> as<00:04:06.540> they

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
world is printing money as fast as they

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.199 
world is printing money as fast as they
can<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.260> has<00:04:07.620> never<00:04:07.859> happened<00:04:08.209> throughout

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
can that has never happened throughout

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.000 
can that has never happened throughout
history<00:04:09.510> we<00:04:09.810> know<00:04:09.989> they<00:04:10.170> won<00:04:10.350> 80<00:04:10.530> local

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
history we know they won 80 local

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.009 
history we know they won 80 local
central<00:04:11.579> bank<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.910> domestic<00:04:12.420> central<00:04:12.750> bank's

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
central bank a domestic central bank's

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.629 
central bank a domestic central bank's
prints<00:04:13.350> money<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.709> always<00:04:14.040> leads<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.400> higher

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
prints money it always leads to higher

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.849 
prints money it always leads to higher
prices<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:16.079> we're<00:04:16.500> going<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.739> have

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
prices so I know we're going to have

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.190 
prices so I know we're going to have
serious<00:04:17.130> inflation<00:04:17.880> down<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.239> road<00:04:18.419> when<00:04:19.080> it

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
serious inflation down the road when it

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.199 
serious inflation down the road when it
happens<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.739> don't<00:04:19.950> know<00:04:20.180> after<00:04:21.180> i

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
happens I don't know after i

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.240 
happens I don't know after i
periodically<00:04:21.750> buy<00:04:22.140> gold<00:04:22.440> i<00:04:22.650> don't<00:04:22.979> have

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
periodically buy gold i don't have

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.280 
periodically buy gold i don't have
any<00:04:23.340> any<00:04:23.850> method<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:24.960> when<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.170> think

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
any any method to it just when I think

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.890 
any any method to it just when I think
about<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.950> do<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.280> by<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:26.850> way<00:04:27.060> if<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.390> IMF

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
about it I do it by the way if the IMF

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.020 
about it I do it by the way if the IMF
sells<00:04:28.260> their<00:04:28.590> gold<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.220> know<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.490> IMF<00:04:29.880> is

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
sells their gold you know the IMF is

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.490 
sells their gold you know the IMF is
dying<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.540> sell<00:04:30.750> their<00:04:30.960> goal<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.320> bail

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
dying to sell their goal to bail

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.470 
dying to sell their goal to bail
everybody<00:04:31.980> out<00:04:32.220> then<00:04:32.730> go<00:04:32.940> could<00:04:33.150> go<00:04:33.270> down<00:04:33.450> a

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
everybody out then go could go down a

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.410 
everybody out then go could go down a
fair<00:04:33.780> amount<00:04:34.400> but<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.610> would<00:04:35.820> be<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.120> bottom

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
fair amount but that would be the bottom

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.780 
fair amount but that would be the bottom
for<00:04:36.630> gold<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.500> IMF<00:04:37.980> doesn't<00:04:38.400> now<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.490> hope

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
for gold if the IMF doesn't now I hope

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.550 
for gold if the IMF doesn't now I hope
the<00:04:38.970> IMF<00:04:39.330> does<00:04:39.570> sell<00:04:39.840> their<00:04:40.050> go<00:04:40.170> for<00:04:40.440> two

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
the IMF does sell their go for two

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.770 
the IMF does sell their go for two
reasons<00:04:40.740> one<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.640> would<00:04:41.820> get<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.000> low<00:04:42.210> price<00:04:42.510> for

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
reasons one we would get a low price for

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.690 
reasons one we would get a low price for
gold<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.290> two<00:04:43.470> then<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.250> could<00:04:44.340> get<00:04:44.490> rid<00:04:44.550> of

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
gold and two then we could get rid of

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.490 
gold and two then we could get rid of
the<00:04:44.850> IMF<00:04:45.270> because<00:04:45.510> after<00:04:45.810> they<00:04:45.930> sell<00:04:46.170> all<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
the IMF because after they sell all the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.930 
the IMF because after they sell all the
gold<00:04:46.740> nobody<00:04:47.160> else<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.460> going<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.700> give<00:04:47.850> them

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
gold nobody else is going to give them

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.730 
gold nobody else is going to give them
any<00:04:48.120> more<00:04:48.270> money<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.750> then<00:04:49.110> with<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.470> IMF

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
any more money and then with the IMF
