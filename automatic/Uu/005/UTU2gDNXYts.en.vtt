00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
at I suppose my life since being at UTS

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.979 
at I suppose my life since being at UTS
which<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.440> 19<00:00:49.829> years<00:00:49.860> ago<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.899> feels<00:00:51.899> very

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
which was 19 years ago it feels very

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
which was 19 years ago it feels very
much<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.500> puzzle<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.280> no<00:00:53.460> real

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
much like a puzzle there was no real

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150 
much like a puzzle there was no real
plan<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> has<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> fit<00:00:55.649> together<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
plan and it has kind of fit together in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.819 
plan and it has kind of fit together in
an<00:00:56.550> odd<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> puzzle

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
an odd way but what that puzzle

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.400 
an odd way but what that puzzle
illuminates<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.760> me<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:01.230> really

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
challenge I faced when I went to UTS was

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
challenge I faced when I went to UTS was
that<00:01:51.229> independent<00:01:52.229> thought<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.860> not

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that independent thought was not

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
that independent thought was not
encouraged<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> demanded<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.840> second

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
influential piece of the puzzle was my

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030 
influential piece of the puzzle was my
love<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> journalism<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.960> actually<00:01:58.530> became

something fortuitous I suppose

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.840 
something fortuitous I suppose
that<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.710> turning<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> drama<00:02:14.520> class<00:02:14.820> in

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
that was turning up to a drama class in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.970

the<00:02:15.390> year<00:02:15.510> 3<00:02:15.780> which<00:02:15.960> was<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.230> graduating<00:02:16.800> year

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.400 
the year 3 which was my graduating year
now<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.600> sure<00:02:18.750> if<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.930> still<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.200> same

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
now I'm not sure if it's still the same

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.280 
now I'm not sure if it's still the same
but<00:02:19.590> when<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.770> was<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.220> needed<00:02:20.580> 24<00:02:21.290> units

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
but when I was there you needed 24 units

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.200 
but when I was there you needed 24 units
to<00:02:22.560> pass<00:02:22.800> each<00:02:23.400> year<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.460> going<00:02:26.460> into<00:02:26.730> my<00:02:26.940> third

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
to pass each year so going into my third

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.360 
to pass each year so going into my third
year<00:02:27.240> I'd<00:02:27.630> accounted<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.110> 22<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.800> those<00:02:28.920> units

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
year I'd accounted for 22 of those units
