hi<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.410> name<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.589> Matt<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.520> are<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:03.000> to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi my name is Matt and we are going to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.780 
hi my name is Matt and we are going to
use<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.049> C<00:00:04.380> major<00:00:04.589> scale<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.509> build<00:00:07.580> all<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
use the C major scale to build all the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.499 
use the C major scale to build all the
seventh<00:00:09.120> chords<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.170> key<00:00:10.490> I<00:00:11.490> use<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
seventh chords in that key I use the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.720 
seventh chords in that key I use the
Caged<00:00:12.719> system<00:00:12.750> CH<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> need<00:00:14.160> five<00:00:14.460> numbers

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
Caged system CH you need five numbers

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.400 
Caged system CH you need five numbers
shapes<00:00:14.990> I'm<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.650> use<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> e<00:00:17.760> shape

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
shapes I'm going to use just the e shape

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.630 
shapes I'm going to use just the e shape
because<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> matches<00:00:19.890> something<00:00:20.250> nice<00:00:20.400> with

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
because it matches something nice with

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.019 
because it matches something nice with
this<00:00:20.869> Barre<00:00:21.869> chord<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.850> key

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this Barre chord so we look at the key

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
this Barre chord so we look at the key
of<00:00:24.119> C<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.330> everybody<00:00:24.810> knows<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.289> pattern<00:00:25.740> if

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
of C and everybody knows this pattern if

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.359 
of C and everybody knows this pattern if
you<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:28.320> need<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> learn<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> goes

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you don't well you need to learn it goes

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:43.970 
you don't well you need to learn it goes
like<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:41.719> when<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.780> play<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> pattern<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
like this when I play this pattern I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.779 
like this when I play this pattern I
like<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.610> start<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.120> C<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:48.170> end<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.530> C

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.520 

because<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> puts<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> musical<00:00:54.690> sense<00:00:54.899> into<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because it puts a musical sense into it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
because it puts a musical sense into it
a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.059> books

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
a lot of books

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
a lot of books
it<00:00:58.170> starts<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> B<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> ends<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.460> D<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it starts on B and it ends on D so it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.600 
it starts on B and it ends on D so it
goes<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> doesn't<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.339> same

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
goes and that this doesn't have the same

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
goes and that this doesn't have the same
musical<00:01:05.790> quality<00:01:06.479> ISM<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> scale

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
musical quality ISM and I like a scale

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
musical quality ISM and I like a scale
that<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.549> sound<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> riff<00:01:12.210> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that actually sound like a riff so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
that actually sound like a riff so
anyway<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
anyway what we do with this and this is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.399 
anyway what we do with this and this is
going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.840> fast<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> furious<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
going to be really fast and furious and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
going to be really fast and furious and
it<00:01:19.409> might<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.619> confusing<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it might be confusing but if you just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
it might be confusing but if you just
keep<00:01:21.330> watching<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.869> video<00:01:22.020> over<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.560> over

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
keep watching this video over and over

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.700 
keep watching this video over and over
again<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:23.490> makes<00:01:23.759> sense

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
again it all makes sense

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.990 
again it all makes sense
chords<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.799> built<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.250> taking<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> first

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
chords are built from taking the first

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.320 
chords are built from taking the first
the<00:01:27.930> third<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.950> fifth

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
the third the fifth

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.430 
the third the fifth
and<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.870> seventh<00:01:31.410> out<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> scale<00:01:33.230> so<00:01:34.230> it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
and the seventh out of the scale so it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.130 
and the seventh out of the scale so it
in<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> case<00:01:35.670> starting<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.210> C<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.600> would<00:01:36.690> be<00:01:36.870> c

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
in this case starting on C it would be c

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
in this case starting on C it would be c

a harp like manner you would just go now

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.670 
a harp like manner you would just go now
what<00:02:03.660> we<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.170> gives<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> C<00:02:04.530> major

cegb

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.869 

the<00:02:24.560> next<00:02:24.890> thing<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.159> do<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.310> instead<00:02:25.609> of

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
the next thing we do is instead of

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.709 
the next thing we do is instead of
starting<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.269> scale<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.750> C<00:02:27.370> we'd<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.579> D<00:02:28.879> now

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
starting the scale on C we'd go to D now

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.119 
starting the scale on C we'd go to D now
I<00:02:30.549> like<00:02:31.549> using<00:02:31.790> modes<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:32.560> analyzing<00:02:33.560> harmony

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
I like using modes for analyzing harmony

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.890 
I like using modes for analyzing harmony
but<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:34.549> like<00:02:34.730> using<00:02:34.909> modes<00:02:35.269> for<00:02:35.480> soloing

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
but I don't like using modes for soloing

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.530 
but I don't like using modes for soloing
so<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:37.370> wouldn't<00:02:37.790> recommend<00:02:37.909> trying<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.420> use

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
so I wouldn't recommend trying to use

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.119 
so I wouldn't recommend trying to use
modes<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:38.930> soloing<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.530> would<00:02:39.680> recommend

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
modes for soloing I would recommend

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.940 
modes for soloing I would recommend
using<00:02:40.430> modes<00:02:40.969> for<00:02:41.090> analyzing<00:02:41.719> the<00:02:42.530> second

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
using modes for analyzing the second

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.009 
using modes for analyzing the second
mode<00:02:43.099> starts<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.670> D<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.120> goes<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.569> have

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
mode starts on D and it goes do you have

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.020 
mode starts on D and it goes do you have

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:34.629 

and<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.629> gives<00:04:14.750> us<00:04:14.930> g7<00:04:31.389> okay<00:04:32.389> we<00:04:32.570> go<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:33.639> GP

and that gives us g7 okay we go to a GP

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.110 
and that gives us g7 okay we go to a GP
and<00:04:35.450> that's<00:04:35.630> one<00:04:36.410> three<00:04:36.740> five<00:04:37.040> seven<00:04:37.120> twenty

and that's one three five seven twenty

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:48.030 
and that's one three five seven twenty
five<00:04:38.419> seven<00:04:39.200> one<00:04:39.880> which<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.120> minor<00:04:41.360> seven

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:56.969 

and<00:04:49.150> then<00:04:50.150> we<00:04:50.330> got<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.570> final<00:04:50.990> which<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:52.010> B<00:04:52.300> D<00:04:53.300> F

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.469 

and<00:04:57.979> that's<00:04:58.550> diminished

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
and that's diminished

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:19.860 
and that's diminished
so<00:05:00.260> it's<00:05:00.410> let's<00:05:00.979> see<00:05:04.660> 4p<00:05:12.820> thinking<00:05:13.820> base<00:05:14.090> out

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.510 

so<00:05:20.870> there<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.080> is<00:05:21.139> fast<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.530> furious

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
so there it is fast and furious

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.219 
so there it is fast and furious
