way<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.380> be<00:05:04.590> if<00:05:05.040> Ashley<00:05:05.880> could<00:05:06.270> keep<00:05:06.480> from

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
way it be if Ashley could keep from

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.230

Lesnar<00:05:06.900> knocking<00:05:07.410> his<00:05:07.530> ass<00:05:07.740> out<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.940> would<00:05:09.120> be

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
Lesnar knocking his ass out it would be

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.060 
Lesnar knocking his ass out it would be
easier<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.840> decision<00:05:10.350> for<00:05:10.530> Leslie<00:05:10.860> right

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
easier this decision for Leslie right

easier this decision for Leslie right
now<00:05:11.220> no<00:05:11.520> doubt<00:05:11.730> that's<00:05:12.480> if<00:05:12.750> Lashley<00:05:13.140> could

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
now no doubt that's if Lashley could

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.510 
now no doubt that's if Lashley could
even<00:05:13.410> make<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.740> out<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.980> first<00:05:14.100> round<00:05:14.280> of

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.300 
even make it out of the first round of
pleasure<00:05:14.790> his<00:05:15.720> strikes<00:05:16.230> are<00:05:16.590> nowhere<00:05:16.830> near<00:05:17.010> as

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310

powerful or fast as letters he doesn't
move<00:05:19.590> as<00:05:19.830> fast<00:05:20.010> as<00:05:20.250> Leslie<00:05:20.640> his<00:05:21.300> stamina<00:05:21.660> isn't

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
move as fast as Leslie his stamina isn't

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.440 
move as fast as Leslie his stamina isn't
even<00:05:22.650> close<00:05:22.980> isn't<00:05:23.580> even<00:05:23.820> half<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.120> letters

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450
