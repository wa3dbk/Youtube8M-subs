fire wall each sheet that's in there

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.960 
fire wall each sheet that's in there
that's<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.410> team<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:56.530> then<00:00:57.530> this<00:01:00.520> is<00:01:01.520> set<00:01:01.820> in

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
that's the team and then this is set in

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.800 
that's the team and then this is set in
place<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.809> give<00:01:03.020> stability<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:08.479> you'll<00:01:08.630> see

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
place to give stability and you'll see

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.680 
place to give stability and you'll see
this<00:01:09.020> all<00:01:09.490> along<00:01:10.490> different<00:01:10.850> areas<00:01:11.420> within

this all along different areas within
the<00:01:11.960> hump<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.060> then<00:01:14.060> over<00:01:14.330> time<00:01:14.509> in<00:01:14.840> between

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the hump and then over time in between

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.230 
the hump and then over time in between
there<00:01:15.440> you're<00:01:15.650> going<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.860> go<00:01:16.190> higher<00:01:19.060> will<00:01:20.060> not

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
there you're going to go higher will not

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
drywall on top which is again I'm going

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
drywall on top which is again I'm going
to<00:01:27.250> have<00:01:27.430> even<00:01:27.670> greater<00:01:27.940> scold<00:01:35.910> when<00:01:36.910> you<00:01:37.030> see
