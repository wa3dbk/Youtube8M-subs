wet<00:01:51.630> layer<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.140> you'll<00:01:52.259> move<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.560> your

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
wet layer and then you'll move on your

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
wet layer and then you'll move on your
dry<00:01:53.040> layer<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> you'll<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.820> same<00:01:54.180> four

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
dry layer and you'll use the same four

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
dry layer and you'll use the same four
by<00:01:54.720> four<00:01:54.990> dressings<00:01:55.500> except<00:01:55.890> they're<00:01:56.009> dry<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
by four dressings except they're dry and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
by four dressings except they're dry and
then<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> lay<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.619> be

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
then you may want to lay them out to be

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.289 
then you may want to lay them out to be
in<00:01:59.210> contact<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> wet

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.109 

and<00:02:04.299> it'll<00:02:04.479> keep<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:05.640> until<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.939> have

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
and it'll keep going until you have

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.479 
and it'll keep going until you have
enough<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.830> then<00:02:08.830> once<00:02:09.039> you're<00:02:09.190> done<00:02:09.220> with

enough and then once you're done with
that<00:02:09.610> you'll<00:02:09.880> put<00:02:10.239> either<00:02:10.929> an<00:02:11.170> island

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that you'll put either an island

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.559 
that you'll put either an island
dressing<00:02:11.680> or<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.190> have<00:02:12.340> an<00:02:12.459> abd<00:02:12.730> pad<00:02:13.090> you'll<00:02:13.360> put

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
dressing or I have an abd pad you'll put

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.589 
dressing or I have an abd pad you'll put
that<00:02:13.720> over<00:02:14.020> there<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.440> then<00:02:14.530> you'll<00:02:15.239> use<00:02:16.239> some

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
that over there and then you'll use some

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.210 
that over there and then you'll use some
skin<00:02:16.930> tape<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.380> go<00:02:17.500> ahead<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.830> tape<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.040> down

skin tape to go ahead and tape that down
island<00:02:19.120> dressings<00:02:19.510> are<00:02:19.660> preferable<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
island dressings are preferable and that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.620 
island dressings are preferable and that
will<00:02:21.550> basically<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:22.150> your<00:02:22.269> wet<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.599> dry

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
will basically be your wet to dry

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.440 
will basically be your wet to dry
dressing<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:24.250> what<00:02:24.489> will<00:02:24.640> happen<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.209> that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
dressing now what will happen is that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.390 
dressing now what will happen is that
these<00:02:26.019> dressings<00:02:26.500> need<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.950> changed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
three one four is that they're painful

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.660 
three one four is that they're painful
to<00:02:45.910> remove<00:02:46.350> they<00:02:47.350> when<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.860> do<00:02:48.040> remove<00:02:48.430> them

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
to remove they when you do remove them

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.120 
to remove they when you do remove them
the<00:02:48.850> whole<00:02:49.000> purpose<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.630> remove<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.380> dead

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
the whole purpose is to remove the dead

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.440 
the whole purpose is to remove the dead
tissue<00:02:51.160> from<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> wound<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.330> they're

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
tissue from the wound so they're

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.630 
tissue from the wound so they're
performing<00:02:52.930> mechanical<00:02:53.590> debridement<00:02:53.890> but

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
performing mechanical debridement but

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.520 
performing mechanical debridement but
they<00:02:54.760> also<00:02:55.030> remove<00:02:55.390> healthy<00:02:55.810> tissue<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.380> it's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
they also remove healthy tissue so it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.530 
they also remove healthy tissue so it's
a<00:02:56.680> non-selective<00:02:57.370> debridement<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.330> so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
a non-selective debridement and so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.870 
a non-selective debridement and so
you're<00:02:58.690> removing<00:02:59.080> granulating<00:02:59.830> tissue<00:03:00.069> which

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
you're removing granulating tissue which

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880 
you're removing granulating tissue which
can<00:03:00.910> cause<00:03:01.269> bleeding<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.080> breakdown<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
can cause bleeding and breakdown of the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.090 
can cause bleeding and breakdown of the
granulation<00:03:03.459> tissue<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> these<00:03:05.349> cause<00:03:05.680> pain

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
granulation tissue so these cause pain

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.150 
granulation tissue so these cause pain
they<00:03:06.820> cause<00:03:07.060> breakdown<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.650> tissue<00:03:08.859> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
they cause breakdown in the tissue and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.190 
they cause breakdown in the tissue and
there's<00:03:09.370> other<00:03:09.640> dressings<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.359> are<00:03:10.630> better

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
there's other dressings that are better

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.440 
there's other dressings that are better
than<00:03:11.500> these<00:03:11.620> dressings<00:03:12.130> for<00:03:12.519> wound<00:03:13.180> healing

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
than these dressings for wound healing

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.479 
than these dressings for wound healing
although<00:03:14.260> studies<00:03:14.470> have<00:03:14.769> really<00:03:15.040> not<00:03:15.190> showed

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
although studies have really not showed

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.340 
although studies have really not showed
that<00:03:15.730> other<00:03:15.940> dressings<00:03:16.510> will<00:03:16.720> heal<00:03:16.930> wounds

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
that other dressings will heal wounds

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.900 
that other dressings will heal wounds
faster<00:03:17.829> than<00:03:18.010> wet<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.280> dry<00:03:18.310> dressings

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
faster than wet to dry dressings

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.940 
faster than wet to dry dressings
commonly<00:03:19.870> we<00:03:20.019> don't<00:03:20.200> use<00:03:20.440> them<00:03:20.620> for<00:03:20.859> this

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
commonly we don't use them for this

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.590 
commonly we don't use them for this
purpose<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.880> if<00:03:21.970> you're<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.269> go<00:03:22.390> ahead

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
purpose so if you're going to go ahead

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.210 
purpose so if you're going to go ahead
and<00:03:22.720> remove<00:03:22.810> them<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.290> top<00:03:23.500> layer<00:03:23.739> won't<00:03:24.070> be

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
and remove them the top layer won't be

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.479 
and remove them the top layer won't be
hard<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.549> remove<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:26.620> probably<00:03:26.920> after<00:03:27.130> 8<00:03:27.370> to

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
hard to remove but probably after 8 to

hard to remove but probably after 8 to
12<00:03:27.700> hours<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.359> dressing<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.140> that's<00:03:29.380> wet

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
12 hours this dressing here that's wet

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.210 
probably be dry and then once you start
removing<00:03:35.859> it<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:37.060> will<00:03:37.390> probably<00:03:37.600> be<00:03:38.079> pretty

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
removing it it will probably be pretty

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.520 
removing it it will probably be pretty
hardly<00:03:39.220> stuck<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.819> surface<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.079> basin

hardly stuck to the surface to the basin

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.229 
hardly stuck to the surface to the basin
of<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.680> wound<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.220> as<00:03:42.370> you're<00:03:42.549> removing<00:03:42.940> it

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
of the wound and as you're removing it

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.000 
of the wound and as you're removing it
you're<00:03:43.510> probably<00:03:43.810> going<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.200> rip<00:03:44.410> off<00:03:44.620> some<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
you're probably going to rip off some of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.890 
you're probably going to rip off some of
this<00:03:45.160> tissue<00:03:45.430> here<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:46.600> going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.810> be

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
this tissue here and it's going to be

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.809 
this tissue here and it's going to be
painful<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.560> patient<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.250> may<00:03:48.519> want

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
painful to the patient so you may want

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.110 
painful to the patient so you may want
to<00:03:49.230> wet<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.470> little<00:03:50.500> bit<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.069> remove<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.639> but

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to wet it a little bit to remove it but

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.879 
to wet it a little bit to remove it but
that<00:03:52.329> does<00:03:52.630> remove<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.260> purpose<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
that does remove the purpose of the

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.930 
that does remove the purpose of the
actual<00:03:54.310> pulling<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.239> off<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.690> mechanically

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
actual pulling it off to mechanically

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.910 
actual pulling it off to mechanically
non-selective<00:03:57.940> really<00:03:58.239> debride<00:03:58.989> some<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.829> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
non-selective really debride some of the

non-selective really debride some of the
tissue<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.519> there<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.709> will<00:04:02.920> be

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
tissue on there and so that will be

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.979 
tissue on there and so that will be
painful<00:04:03.639> so<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:03.910> may<00:04:04.150> want<00:04:04.389> to<00:04:04.450> medicate<00:04:04.900> your
