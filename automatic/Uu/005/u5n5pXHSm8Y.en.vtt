00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
take this off of the bone so you could

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
take this off of the bone so you could
have<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.129> boneless<00:00:41.510> skin-on<00:00:42.510> chicken<00:00:42.809> breast

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
may run the risk of getting behind one

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
may run the risk of getting behind one
bone<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.119> want<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> move<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.659> knife<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> get

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
away from the bone almost like a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.999 
away from the bone almost like a
whittling<00:01:51.030> motion<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.590> once<00:01:52.829> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
basically make like a arcing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.309 
basically make like a arcing
round<00:02:06.180> cut<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:11.330> i<00:02:12.330> also<00:02:12.630> have<00:02:12.840> a

to come away from the bone and even let

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.500 
to come away from the bone and even let
gravity<00:02:37.950> help<00:02:38.340> me<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.700> bit<00:02:38.880> cut<00:02:39.300> through

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
gravity help me a little bit cut through

hand and outside of that I have a little
bit<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.410> bone<00:03:08.069> right<00:03:08.310> along<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.090> once<00:03:09.630> I

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
bit of bone right along here and once I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.470 
bit of bone right along here and once I
cut<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.049> up<00:03:10.370> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> hold<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> chicken<00:03:12.209> up

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
cut that up going to hold the chicken up

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.650 
cut that up going to hold the chicken up
by<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.200> very<00:03:13.709> tip<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.220> breast<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.880> start

by the very tip of the breast and start
to<00:03:15.780> cut<00:03:15.959> along<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:17.070> basically<00:03:17.459> start<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to cut along and basically start to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.420 
to cut along and basically start to
separate<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.780> meat<00:03:18.959> from<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.829> bone<00:03:22.430> really

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
separate the meat from the bone really

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.729 
separate the meat from the bone really
using<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> tip<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> knife

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
