00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
practical thing for me as I'm able to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
practical thing for me as I'm able to
crop<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.360> still

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
crop and when I do that I can still

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.290 
crop and when I do that I can still
print<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.440> eleven<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.219> fourteen

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
you want from a sports camera first is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
you want from a sports camera first is
you<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.740> high<00:01:14.010> continuous<00:01:14.460> framerate<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you want a high continuous framerate and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.160 
you want a high continuous framerate and
the<00:01:15.240> next<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:15.810> accurate

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the next is you want a very accurate

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.719 
the next is you want a very accurate
autofocus<00:01:16.619> system<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.640> going

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
autofocus system that's actually going

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.210 
autofocus system that's actually going
to<00:01:17.820> track<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.299> subject<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> d50

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to track your subject so with the d50

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
to track your subject so with the d50
300<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> having<00:01:21.000> five<00:01:21.270> frames<00:01:21.540> per<00:01:21.780> second<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
300 you having five frames per second so

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
300 you having five frames per second so
it's<00:01:22.470> quite<00:01:23.189> fast<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.270> compact<00:01:24.630> little

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it's quite fast for a compact little

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
it's quite fast for a compact little
camera<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.189> also<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.729> highly

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
camera like this you also have a highly

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
camera like this you also have a highly
advanced<00:01:27.840> 39<00:01:28.320> point<00:01:28.710> autofocus<00:01:29.430> system<00:01:29.610> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
advanced 39 point autofocus system so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 
advanced 39 point autofocus system so
the<00:01:30.890> best<00:01:31.890> part<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> system<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> yes

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the best part about the system is yes

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
the best part about the system is yes
there's<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> points<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.680> they're<00:01:34.829> very

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there's a lot of points but they're very

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
there's a lot of points but they're very
densely<00:01:35.430> packed<00:01:35.700> together<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> camera

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
densely packed together so the camera

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
densely packed together so the camera
always<00:01:37.350> knows<00:01:37.890> where<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.310> subject<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
always knows where your subject is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
always knows where your subject is
whether<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.180> tracking<00:01:39.450> towards<00:01:40.259> away<00:01:40.710> or

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
whether it's tracking towards away or

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
whether it's tracking towards away or

that those images are and that video is
a<00:02:50.849> whole<00:02:51.030> lot<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.329> smooth<00:02:51.599> now<00:02:52.370> Nikon<00:02:53.370> has

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
a whole lot more smooth now Nikon has

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.300 
a whole lot more smooth now Nikon has
also<00:02:53.670> improved<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.510> way<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:55.310> autofocuses

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310

also improved the way it autofocuses
with<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> new<00:02:57.390> 18<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.049> 140<00:02:58.650> when<00:02:58.829> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
with the new 18 to 140 when it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.069 
with the new 18 to 140 when it's
combined<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.609> d50<00:03:00.030> 300<00:03:00.540> you're<00:03:00.959> gonna

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
combined with the d50 300 you're gonna

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.960 
combined with the d50 300 you're gonna
find<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.470> autofocus<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:02.069> video<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.730> much

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
find the autofocus in video is so much

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.720 
find the autofocus in video is so much
more<00:03:03.239> smooth<00:03:03.659> but<00:03:03.959> more<00:03:04.620> importantly<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.310> much

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
more smooth but more importantly so much

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.190 
more smooth but more importantly so much
more<00:03:05.879> quiet<00:03:06.359> with<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.170> lens<00:03:07.579> nikon<00:03:08.579> has<00:03:08.609> also

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
more quiet with this lens nikon has also

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.259 
more quiet with this lens nikon has also
improved<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.500> LCD<00:03:11.069> screen<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.519> swivel<00:03:11.879> LCD

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
improved the LCD screen the swivel LCD

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.690 
improved the LCD screen the swivel LCD
screen<00:03:12.599> by<00:03:12.750> expanding<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.739> 3.2<00:03:14.250> inches<00:03:14.579> so

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
screen by expanding it to 3.2 inches so

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.210 
screen by expanding it to 3.2 inches so
it's<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.849> bigger<00:03:15.060> screen<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.190> the
