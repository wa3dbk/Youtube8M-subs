over<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> chop<00:01:24.659> open<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> tree<00:01:25.259> then

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
over here to chop open the tree then

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.289 
over here to chop open the tree then
they're<00:01:26.220> gonna<00:01:26.310> find<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> see
