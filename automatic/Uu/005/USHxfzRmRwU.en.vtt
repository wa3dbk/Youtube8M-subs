 that can beat the Flemish and not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.450
 cross the other side where you are 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.450
 of those of the earth 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.989
 the first one has to know the place 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.640
 so I come before I usually do 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.380
 maps of the competition the czech map 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.790
 so I've traveled all over the place 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.739
 in more or less how long it takes 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.030
 go to every point that does not help if you know 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.360
 how to get there if you do not know how much 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.489
 time it takes to provide an emergency is 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
 our first function was security 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.840
 then it is to position Carlos the team of 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.830
 Rescue firefighters and ambulances and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.140
 lifeguards 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.550
 for the immediate relief and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.260
 also for those who have the vision of proof 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.750
 sometimes someone can play a reservation and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.130
 you do not have the national pilot one 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
 frequency are also very important and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.940
 profiles if you have eyes on the competition 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.290
 so my job is to spread the agency to the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 along the route so that they are the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.880
 eyes of the organization of the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.330
 the second function is to collect staff 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420
 but that later everyone to land with 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.420
 safety 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.459
 they will fly over the low city when 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.819
 go to the low side of the city when 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.819

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.020

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.020

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.490

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.930

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.930
 way back to give 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.989
