00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
switch on s beam on both devices so

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860 
switch on s beam on both devices so
we'll<00:00:13.559> get<00:00:13.679> menu<00:00:14.009> settings<00:00:14.849> scroll<00:00:15.450> down<00:00:15.690> to

the first transfer that will do cross

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.179 
the first transfer that will do cross
will<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.050> something<00:00:25.529> simple<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
will be something simple like a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.650 
will be something simple like a
photograph<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.820> I've<00:00:27.000> taken<00:00:27.150> using<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
photograph that I've taken using the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.970 
photograph that I've taken using the
note<00:00:27.810> 3's<00:00:28.080> camera<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.529> once<00:00:28.680> you've<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
note 3's camera so once you've got a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.830 
note 3's camera so once you've got a
media<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> screen<00:00:29.730> simply<00:00:30.179> touch<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.689> two

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
media on the screen simply touch the two

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
media on the screen simply touch the two
backs<00:00:31.109> together<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.679> says<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.189> beam<00:00:32.610> tap<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
backs together it says two beam tap the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
backs together it says two beam tap the
screen<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.200> separate<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
screen and then you can separate the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380 
screen and then you can separate the
devices<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.059> done<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
devices and you can see it's done the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.940 
devices and you can see it's done the
transfer<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.200> quickly<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
transfer and that's how quickly it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
transfer and that's how quickly it
transfers<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.760> photograph<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:39.899> s<00:00:40.230> beam<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
transfers a photograph using s beam and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
transfers a photograph using s beam and
it<00:00:40.770> saves<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.700> gallery<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.239> the

it saves it into your gallery on the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
it saves it into your gallery on the
receiving<00:00:43.260> device<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.920> we'll<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
receiving device so what we'll do on the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950
