Meiko robotic-assisted surgery is a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990 
Meiko robotic-assisted surgery is a
system<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.830> combines<00:00:17.279> current

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
system that combines current

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.810 
system that combines current
technologies<00:00:18.630> such<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:18.960> computer<00:00:19.320> navigation

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
technologies such as computer navigation

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.060 
technologies such as computer navigation
takes<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> another<00:00:21.090> level<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.960> accuracy<00:00:22.380> by

takes it to another level of accuracy by

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
takes it to another level of accuracy by
making<00:00:23.460> its<00:00:23.610> patient<00:00:24.029> specific<00:00:24.599> then<00:00:25.140> adding

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
making its patient specific then adding

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
making its patient specific then adding
on<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:26.040> level<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.460> precision<00:00:26.700> that<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> robot

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
on a level of precision that of a robot

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.280 
on a level of precision that of a robot
actually<00:00:28.560> performing<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.759> bony<00:00:30.290> receptions

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
actually performing the bony receptions

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.440 
actually performing the bony receptions
rather<00:00:31.590> than<00:00:31.860> north<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.610> exert<00:00:32.850> Ian's<00:00:33.030> hands

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
rather than north they exert Ian's hands

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.350 
rather than north they exert Ian's hands
now<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.350> make<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> plan<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.190> 3d<00:00:35.700> space<00:00:35.940> from

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
now we can make a plan in 3d space from

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.470 
now we can make a plan in 3d space from
our<00:00:36.510> CT<00:00:36.989> scan<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.380> particular<00:00:37.739> patient

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
our CT scan of that particular patient

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.580 
our CT scan of that particular patient
go<00:00:39.480> ahead<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> register<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
go ahead and register that in the

go ahead and register that in the
computer<00:00:41.070> using<00:00:41.730> pointers<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.540> show<00:00:42.750> us

computer using pointers to show us
various<00:00:43.230> anatomy<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.430> patient<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.030> our

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
various anatomy of the patient make our

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.820 
various anatomy of the patient make our
plan<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.660> adjustments<00:00:46.380> for<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.560> soft

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
plan make adjustments for the soft

tissue in the operating room

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.450 
tissue in the operating room
and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.930> once<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.590> our<00:00:49.710> plan<00:00:50.010> exactly

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and then once we have our plan exactly

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
and then once we have our plan exactly
the<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:50.880> we<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.990> don't<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the way we want it we don't have to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
the way we want it we don't have to
worry<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.560> the<00:00:52.829> execution<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.700> robot

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
worry about the execution the robot

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.310 
worry about the execution the robot
comes<00:00:54.240> in<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.510> does<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.720> execution<00:00:55.290> just

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
comes in and does the execution just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
comes in and does the execution just
like<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.010> mill<00:00:56.670> would<00:00:57.000> work<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> piece<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.690> metal

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
like a mill would work a piece of metal

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.710 
like a mill would work a piece of metal
and<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.470> factory<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.730> precise<00:01:00.180> since

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
and a factory it's that precise since

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.860 
and a factory it's that precise since
the<00:01:00.870> implant<00:01:01.230> designs<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.980> gotten<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.520> good

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
the implant designs have gotten so good

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.299 
the implant designs have gotten so good
now<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> limitation<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> human<00:01:05.009> end

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
now the limitation is on the human end

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
now the limitation is on the human end
and<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.210> makeup<00:01:06.420> brings<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:06.990> patient

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and so what makeup brings to the patient

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.359 
and so what makeup brings to the patient
is<00:01:07.590> allow<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.390> implant<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:10.560> achieve

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is allow the implant to actually achieve

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
is allow the implant to actually achieve
its<00:01:11.520> full<00:01:11.729> potential<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.380> put

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
its full potential because we don't put

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
its full potential because we don't put
the<00:01:13.649> implant<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> exact<00:01:15.000> precision

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the implant in in the exact precision

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
the implant in in the exact precision
that<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.350> can't<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> full

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that we have to it can't see the full

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
that we have to it can't see the full
potential<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.329> designed<00:01:18.450> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
potential that was actually designed it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.230 
potential that was actually designed it
says<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.649> in<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.950> other<00:01:20.399> benefits<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.149> the

says I in for other benefits to the
patient<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.749> course<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.649> include<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.969> less

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
patient of course would include the less

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.609 
patient of course would include the less
chance<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.749> you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.079> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> revision

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
chance that you have to have a revision

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
chance that you have to have a revision
of<00:01:25.649> surgery<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.819> have<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.999> have<00:01:27.090> revision

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
of surgery if you have to have revision

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.760 
of surgery if you have to have revision
surgery<00:01:27.749> when<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:27.960> 90<00:01:28.229> years<00:01:28.289> old<00:01:28.530> that's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
surgery when you're 90 years old that's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.989 
surgery when you're 90 years old that's
much<00:01:29.009> more<00:01:29.219> of<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> problem<00:01:29.579> than<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.880> have

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
much more of a problem than you have

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.719 
much more of a problem than you have
surgery<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.450> yogurt<00:01:30.749> 70<00:01:31.619> even<00:01:31.859> and<00:01:32.219> so<00:01:32.670> if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
surgery with yogurt 70 even and so if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.179 
surgery with yogurt 70 even and so if
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.030> avoid<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.359> by<00:01:34.039> making<00:01:35.039> your

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you can avoid that by making your

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.940 
you can avoid that by making your
surgery<00:01:35.789> more<00:01:36.030> precise<00:01:36.719> and<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.530> implant

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
surgery more precise and the implant

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.459 
surgery more precise and the implant
design<00:01:38.429> has<00:01:38.670> come<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.209> can<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:39.990> meet

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
design has come up and can actually meet

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.849 
design has come up and can actually meet
that<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.959> combined<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:43.679> can

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
that those two combined and really can

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.029 
that those two combined and really can
take<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.249> to<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> lifetime<00:01:45.029> implant<00:01:46.039> accuracy

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
take that to a lifetime implant accuracy

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.330 
take that to a lifetime implant accuracy
of<00:01:47.310> implantation<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.600> longevity<00:01:49.109> is<00:01:49.889> one<00:01:50.279> of

of implantation and longevity is one of
the<00:01:50.399> main<00:01:50.609> concerns<00:01:50.969> we<00:01:51.209> have<00:01:51.799> it's<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:52.859> of

because the surgeons we know what

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.059 
because the surgeons we know what
multiple<00:01:57.689> surgeries<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> road<00:01:58.740> over

surgical plan what matters is how I do
the<00:02:38.400> patient<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.180> how<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> plan<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:39.900> that

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the patient and how I plan for that

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.259 
the patient and how I plan for that
surgery<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.890> Mako<00:02:41.430> allows<00:02:41.819> me<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
surgery and the Mako allows me to

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.410 
surgery and the Mako allows me to
perform<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.989> task<00:02:43.310> no<00:02:44.310> matter<00:02:44.340> what<00:02:44.700> these

perform that task no matter what these
patients<00:02:45.750> recover<00:02:46.050> extremely<00:02:46.530> fast<00:02:46.769> about<00:02:47.640> 25

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
patients recover extremely fast about 25

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.580 
patients recover extremely fast about 25
percent<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.540> procedures<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.319> have

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
percent of the procedures that I have

percent of the procedures that I have
done<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.920> my<00:02:50.010> career<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> partial<00:02:51.360> knee

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
done in my career on the partial knee

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.820 
done in my career on the partial knee
side<00:02:51.720> has<00:02:51.870> actually<00:02:52.140> been<00:02:52.230> outpatient

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
side has actually been outpatient

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.339 
side has actually been outpatient
procedures<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:54.090> are<00:02:54.150> 75%<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:54.959> done<00:02:55.110> either

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
procedures there are 75% are done either

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.140 
procedures there are 75% are done either
say<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.860> night<00:02:56.069> maybe<00:02:56.370> two<00:02:56.700> nights<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
say one night maybe two nights in the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.180 
say one night maybe two nights in the
hospital<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.590> very<00:02:58.739> different

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
hospital so this is very different
