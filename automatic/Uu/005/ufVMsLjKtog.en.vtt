00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.110
 party here is a here I was really 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.180
 well monday at work flew she was 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.410
 really very very well so that's it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.329
 was confident that's for sure 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.070
 first time the other day that one day he 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.890
 a fortnight ago the mare was not not 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.790
 all ready to do something 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.470
 she needed to run today 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.240
 she really showed her face in 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.860
 pure class it was a mare 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.080
 that a lot of qualities she was 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.730
 very quickly we will succeed and he 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.850
 was enough that he found his level for 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.830
 to be good like when I came to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.700
 you are a month ago right now 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.720
 is human did not have the state it's a 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.100
 little smile like thala right now 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.680
 and she really likes a lot 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 yeah that's true judgment plus who goes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880
 not be embarrassed to go the distance 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.259
 going very good engine and that will not do 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.299
 embarrassment and iron 2007 or 2008 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.219
 now no problem how she 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.880
 arrived in quebec she arrived 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.250
 by the summer 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.750
 the state sells when we bought everything and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.189
 then we have not run 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.020
 directly because she had 2-3 for 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.570
 a little problem at this concert in front of him 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 had to heal and then she was by 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.500
 after running so we had to make some 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.060
 care on it we took our time and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.509
 then now there a moment he is going 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.530
 can make up for the time spent at 72 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.799
 hours the 72 hours of the gods or berthe 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.740
 memorial satisfied by the draw 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.209
 satisfied 5 and 6 it's good it will be 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.009
 may be missing a little bit more in 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.770
 but hey we are happy before the 5th 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.399
 or the 6 and 7 nitoo does weaken I 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 think it's good now we'll see 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.429
 the horses that he will not have to go 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.429
 do anything and decide 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.670
 knife at the feast beat at the end you 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.180
 had to believe it yeah no three as he 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.769
 manages to bounce well after good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.260
 often I had more eric horse to 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.959
 listen to me that I wanted it is to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.989
 give to the angels is not bad finish 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.609
 soon we are step parents chalon me 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.650
 Tactically frustrated you still have 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.360
 very well play cost has come ready to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.100
 delay his vis-à-vis them 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 eric's chf at the players' business 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.150
 of the circuit after that we are beaten by 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.800
 another horse that we do not want 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.440
 knew very well that they were pretty 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.270
 hot as déferré of the four good here 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 we had modeled the race to the back on 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.560
 choice of eric at the bottom but we are beaten 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 by the other roberto third and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.920
 it's not the right course a new 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.080
 unfortunately it's not good 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.380
 number pace course already make a 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.170
 huge effort to leave and do 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.850
 we can not find ourselves 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.340
 another half turn or a turn 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.340
 ignoring necessarily in a straight line we 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.560
 pay a little bit and it's not 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.350
 really aimed races we were left behind 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.950
 not all the horses or tests two 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.390
 per week 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.920
 grown by them for the real goals 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.070
 but obviously it's the criterium of the 5 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.070
 years 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 my 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.200
 cb 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.550
 c 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.010
 it's OK 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.990
 if hockey
