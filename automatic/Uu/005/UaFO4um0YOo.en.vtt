left hand you're just going to punch the
pin<00:01:59.909> through

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.230 

because<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.400> we're<00:02:05.520> gonna<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.090> we're

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because what we're gonna do what we're

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
because what we're gonna do what we're
doing<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.689> we're<00:02:06.840> putting<00:02:06.869> holes<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.280> card

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
doing is we're putting holes in the card

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.510 
doing is we're putting holes in the card
stock<00:02:08.880> underneath<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> we're<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> use

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
stock underneath so we're going to use

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
stock underneath so we're going to use
our<00:02:11.610> pattern<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.720> there's<00:02:12.900> no<00:02:12.989> order<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
our pattern now there's no order you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559 
our pattern now there's no order you
have<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.370> keep<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
have to do this in just keep going to

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.280 
have to do this in just keep going to
get<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.170> hole<00:02:16.590> everywhere<00:02:17.810> show<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.760> where<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
get a hole everywhere show you where the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.009 
get a hole everywhere show you where the
dots<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.470> real<00:02:23.310> simple<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.630> all<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
dots are real simple so do that all the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.110 
dots are real simple so do that all the
way<00:02:25.140> around<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.489> I'll<00:02:26.790> show<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> what

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
way around and then I'll show you what

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.190 
way around and then I'll show you what
to<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.330> next<00:02:29.360> okay<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> we're<00:02:30.989> done

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to do next okay now that we're done

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.370 
to do next okay now that we're done
working<00:02:31.800> at<00:02:32.099> patterns<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.200> take

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
working at patterns we are going to take

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.110 
working at patterns we are going to take
it<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.430> done<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
it out and now we are done with this you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.250 
it out and now we are done with this you
can<00:02:36.209> put<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.510> aside<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.959> use<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.170> again<00:02:37.350> later

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
can put it aside and use it again later

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.400 
can put it aside and use it again later
now<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.709> pattern<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.380> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
now with the pattern you have a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
now with the pattern you have a
stitching<00:02:43.920> guide<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> guy<00:02:45.690> to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
stitching guide this is just a guy to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
stitching guide this is just a guy to
tell<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.769> start<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.280> how<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.519> do<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
tell you where to start and how to do it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.890 
tell you where to start and how to do it
I<00:02:48.090> use<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> words<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.860> some

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I use the words up and down some

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.840 
I use the words up and down some
designers<00:02:51.900> use<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.310> out

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
designers use in and out

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990 
designers use in and out
I<00:02:54.500> prefer<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I prefer up and down you know just a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.449 
I prefer up and down you know just a
preference<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.510> no<00:02:57.630> big<00:02:57.780> deal

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
preference it's no big deal

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.460 
preference it's no big deal
so<00:02:59.459> on<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.360> card<00:03:00.950> here's<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.690> some

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
so on the card here's one now some

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.710 
so on the card here's one now some
patterns<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.160> do<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:06.060> very<00:03:06.360> exact

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
patterns you do need to be very exact

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.569 
patterns you do need to be very exact
where<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.959> one<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> heart<00:03:08.340> we're

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
where the one is this is a heart we're

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.770 
where the one is this is a heart we're
doing<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> same<00:03:09.030> pattern<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.690> way

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
doing the same pattern all the way

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.380 
doing the same pattern all the way
around<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.430> I'm<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.880> estimate

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
around so I'm just going to estimate

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.539 
around so I'm just going to estimate
where<00:03:12.720> one<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.590> instead<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.010> counting<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
where one is instead of counting but you

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.949 
where one is instead of counting but you
can<00:03:14.730> count<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.090> holes<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.390> find<00:03:15.570> number<00:03:15.780> one

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
can count the holes and find number one

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.640 
can count the holes and find number one
so<00:03:16.579> we're<00:03:17.579> going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.880> up<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.290> by<00:03:19.440> up

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
so we're going to go up at one and by up

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890 
so we're going to go up at one and by up
I<00:03:19.890> mean<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.250> from<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.790> back<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.600> design

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
I mean going from the back of the design

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.960 
I mean going from the back of the design
to<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.170> front<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.040> front<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.489> side<00:03:23.790> that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
to the front the front is the side that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.699 
to the front the front is the side that
you're<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.570> see<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.350> card<00:03:25.620> is

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
you're going to see when the card is

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.500 
you're going to see when the card is
done<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.440> now<00:03:28.820> we're<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> secure<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
done so now we're going to secure this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.309 
done so now we're going to secure this
with<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> piece<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.959> tape<00:03:32.750> just<00:03:33.750> accurate<00:03:34.260> in

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
with a piece of tape just accurate in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.750 
with a piece of tape just accurate in
fact<00:03:34.530> they're<00:03:34.680> trying<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> cover<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.640> in

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
fact they're trying not to cover it in

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
fact they're trying not to cover it in
the<00:03:35.850> holes<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.299> mean<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:37.680> we<00:03:37.739> went

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
the holes that you mean so now we went

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.610 
the holes that you mean so now we went
up<00:03:38.010> at<00:03:38.160> one<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.450> pattern<00:03:39.750> says<00:03:40.140> down<00:03:40.440> at

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
up at one now the pattern says down at

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.370 
up at one now the pattern says down at
three<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.819> if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.000> look<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.959> one

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
three so if you look here we have one

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.640 
three so if you look here we have one
two<00:03:43.620> three<00:03:43.829> four<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.450> I'm<00:03:46.049> going<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.319> go<00:03:46.410> down

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
two three four so I'm going to go down

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
two three four so I'm going to go down
at<00:03:46.799> three<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.400> three<00:03:47.639> will<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.239> second

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
at three so three will be the second

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.099 
at three so three will be the second
hole<00:03:49.139> up<00:03:49.440> from<00:03:49.859> where<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.069> went<00:03:50.340> up<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.989> we're

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
hole up from where I went up so we're

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.759 
hole up from where I went up so we're
going<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.380> down<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:54.260> then<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> next<00:03:55.410> step

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
going to go down and then the next step

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.699 
going to go down and then the next step
is<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:56.010> go<00:03:56.100> up<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:56.459> two<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.780> two<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.620> between

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
is to go up at two so two is in between

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.860 
is to go up at two so two is in between

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
one and three we're going to go up at

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.319 
one and three we're going to go up at
two<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.220> says<00:04:02.370> down<00:04:02.579> at<00:04:02.730> four<00:04:02.970> so

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
two and then it says down at four so

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.610 
two and then it says down at four so
we're<00:04:03.450> gonna<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.630> down<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:03.900> four<00:04:04.139> it's<00:04:04.380> real

simple

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
simple

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.330 
simple
once<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.329> get<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.510> hang<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.100> we're

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
once you get the hang of it so now we're

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.440 
once you get the hang of it so now we're
just<00:04:08.489> going<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.639> do<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.790> same<00:04:08.970> pattern<00:04:09.209> all

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
just going to do that same pattern all

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.890 
just going to do that same pattern all
the<00:04:09.480> way<00:04:09.540> around<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:11.329> without<00:04:12.329> numbers<00:04:12.720> we're

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the way around so without numbers we're

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.180 
the way around so without numbers we're
just<00:04:13.049> going<00:04:13.199> to<00:04:13.229> know<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.709> powder

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
just going to know that the powder

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.930 
just going to know that the powder
is<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.580> skip<00:04:14.850> one<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:17.090> then<00:04:18.090> go<00:04:18.239> back<00:04:18.450> down<00:04:18.480> one

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
is to skip one and then go back down one

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.720 
is to skip one and then go back down one
and<00:04:20.940> then<00:04:21.209> skip<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:23.400> we're<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:23.580> gonna

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and then skip one and we're just gonna

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.700 
and then skip one and we're just gonna
do<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:23.880> all<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.570> way<00:04:24.660> around<00:04:25.020> until<00:04:25.290> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
do that all the way around until the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.440 
do that all the way around until the
heart<00:04:25.890> is<00:04:25.980> finished<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.700> then<00:04:27.180> we're<00:04:27.300> done

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
heart is finished and then we're done

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.870 
heart is finished and then we're done
and<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.650> frame<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:28.950> or<00:04:29.220> make<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.580> into<00:04:29.700> a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and you can frame it or make it into a

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.480 
and you can frame it or make it into a
card<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.360> will<00:04:31.140> do<00:04:31.260> another<00:04:31.470> video<00:04:31.680> on<00:04:32.070> how<00:04:32.460> to

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
card I will do another video on how to

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.620 
card I will do another video on how to
turn<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:32.790> into<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.150> card<00:04:33.450> thanks<00:04:34.170> for<00:04:34.290> watching
