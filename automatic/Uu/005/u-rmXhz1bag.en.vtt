four<00:00:53.100> times<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.969> microwave<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.660> an<00:00:55.260> 800<00:00:56.160> watt

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
four times my microwave is an 800 watt

four times my microwave is an 800 watt
one<00:00:56.489> okay<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.180> you've<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> slightly

one okay so if you've got a slightly

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
one okay so if you've got a slightly
weaker<00:00:58.079> microwave<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> oh<00:00:58.980> no<00:00:59.370> 600<00:00:59.969> 700

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
weaker microwave than that oh no 600 700

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.389 
weaker microwave than that oh no 600 700
watt<00:01:00.710> it's<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.190> about
