a local produce and just really get into
connecting<00:02:45.630> get<00:02:46.110> connected<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.650> our

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
connecting get connected with our

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.640 
connecting get connected with our
surroundings<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:49.350> what<00:02:49.530> we

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
surroundings again and that's what we
