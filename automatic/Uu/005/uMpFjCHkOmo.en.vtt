so<00:00:16.350> what<00:00:16.529> we're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.789> going

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:18.029> compare<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.800> reference

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
to compare this to what is a reference

to compare this to what is a reference
card<00:00:20.789> we're<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> explain<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
card we're going to explain the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
card we're going to explain the
difference<00:00:22.320> between<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.680> reference<00:00:23.130> card<00:00:23.369> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
usually the major differences are going

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
usually the major differences are going

from the competition

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.960 
from the competition
now<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.260> actual<00:02:54.800> performance<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.610> cards

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
now the actual performance of the cards

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.730 
now the actual performance of the cards
especially<00:02:56.570> when<00:02:56.720> you're<00:02:56.840> talking<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.230> cards

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
especially when you're talking to cards

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.040 
especially when you're talking to cards
with<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> reference<00:02:58.160> PCB<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.060> going<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.810> come

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
with a reference PCB is going to come

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.080 
with a reference PCB is going to come
down<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> couple<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.370> things<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:01.790> how<00:03:01.910> much

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
down to a couple of things so how much

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.020 
down to a couple of things so how much
ram<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.600> has<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.410> PCB<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:04.220> case<00:03:04.430> both

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
ram it has on that PCB in this case both

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.970 
ram it has on that PCB in this case both
of<00:03:05.240> these<00:03:05.330> cards<00:03:05.630> are<00:03:05.900> three<00:03:06.260> gig<00:03:06.470> cards<00:03:06.830> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
of these cards are three gig cards and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.740 
of these cards are three gig cards and
we're<00:03:07.070> running<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.370> 1080p<00:03:07.820> resolutions<00:03:08.600> so

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
we're running at 1080p resolutions so

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.480 
we're running at 1080p resolutions so
Ram<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.170> pretty<00:03:09.770> much<00:03:09.920> not<00:03:10.160> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.459> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
Ram is pretty much not going to be a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.910 
Ram is pretty much not going to be a
factor<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.390> next<00:03:11.720> thing<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.410> clock<00:03:12.680> speed

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
factor the next thing is the clock speed

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.460 
factor the next thing is the clock speed
so<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.490> dual<00:03:13.880> X<00:03:14.090> card<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.540> actually<00:03:14.750> slightly

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so this dual X card is actually slightly

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
so this dual X card is actually slightly
overclocked<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.790> what<00:03:16.970> you'll<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.300> here<00:03:17.570> in

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
overclocked so what you'll see here in

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.080 
overclocked so what you'll see here in
our<00:03:17.810> battlefield<00:03:18.380> 3<00:03:18.709> example<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.910> the

we were able to get these overclocked

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.470 
we were able to get these overclocked
results<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.470> got<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.950> more<00:03:55.250> than<00:03:55.519> 10%<00:03:55.910> about

temperatures<00:04:05.900> at<00:04:06.080> idle<00:04:06.799> they<00:04:07.370> were<00:04:07.430> pretty

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
temperatures at idle they were pretty

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.509 
temperatures at idle they were pretty
consistent<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.170> reference<00:04:09.620> card<00:04:09.860> ran<00:04:10.250> at

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
consistent so the reference card ran at

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.759 
consistent so the reference card ran at
about<00:04:10.790> 39<00:04:11.299> degrees<00:04:11.810> at<00:04:11.840> idle<00:04:12.290> whereas<00:04:12.590> the

about 39 degrees at idle whereas the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.039 
about 39 degrees at idle whereas the

dual X in both its non overclocked and
it's<00:04:15.290> overclocked<00:04:15.739> state<00:04:16.040> ran<00:04:16.669> at<00:04:16.970> about<00:04:17.419> 32

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810

33<00:04:18.500> degrees<00:04:19.160> at<00:04:19.310> idle<00:04:19.580> however<00:04:19.970> when<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:20.660> get

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
33 degrees at idle however when we get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.630 
33 degrees at idle however when we get
to<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.229> low<00:04:21.440> temperatures<00:04:22.070> that's<00:04:22.310> where<00:04:22.520> the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
to the low temperatures that's where the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.150 
to the low temperatures that's where the
difference<00:04:23.030> really<00:04:23.690> starts<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.440> take<00:04:24.650> off<00:04:24.800> so

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
difference really starts to take off so

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.930 
difference really starts to take off so
our

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
our

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.250 
our
our<00:04:26.000> consumption<00:04:26.420> you<00:04:26.660> can<00:04:26.690> see<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.080> pretty

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
our consumption you can see is pretty

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.380 
our consumption you can see is pretty
similar<00:04:27.560> across<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> board<00:04:28.220> okay<00:04:29.180> our

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
similar across the board okay our

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.260 
similar across the board okay our
performance<00:04:30.100> scales<00:04:31.100> as<00:04:31.370> we<00:04:31.520> overclock<00:04:32.060> and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
performance scales as we overclock and

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.760 
performance scales as we overclock and
is<00:04:32.390> slightly<00:04:32.840> higher<00:04:33.170> with<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.560> stock

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
is slightly higher with the stock

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.320 
is slightly higher with the stock
overclock<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.400> these<00:04:34.520> are<00:04:34.670> our<00:04:34.790> performance

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
overclock so these are our performance

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.990 
overclock so these are our performance
bars<00:04:35.540> right<00:04:35.750> here<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.530> let's<00:04:36.770> talk<00:04:37.040> temps<00:04:37.520> so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
bars right here but let's talk temps so

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.870 
bars right here but let's talk temps so
our<00:04:38.390> load<00:04:38.750> temperatures<00:04:39.470> were<00:04:39.830> even<00:04:40.520> add<00:04:40.730> a

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
our load temperatures were even add a

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.330 
our load temperatures were even add a
one<00:04:41.240> point<00:04:41.450> one<00:04:41.690> gigahertz<00:04:42.080> overclock<00:04:42.770> more

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
one point one gigahertz overclock more

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.490 
one point one gigahertz overclock more
than<00:04:43.520> ten<00:04:43.850> degrees<00:04:44.270> cooler<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.290> in<00:04:45.410> a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.570 
real gaming load versus our reference
card<00:04:48.350> now<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.950> is<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> bit<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.490> an

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
card now this is a bit of an

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.790 
card now this is a bit of an
exaggeration<00:04:49.850> because<00:04:50.480> we're<00:04:50.900> running<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.410> an

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
exaggeration because we're running on an

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.220 
exaggeration because we're running on an
open<00:04:52.130> test<00:04:52.370> platform<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:53.240> what<00:04:53.420> that<00:04:53.570> means<00:04:53.930> is

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
open test platform so what that means is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.830 
open test platform so what that means is
that<00:04:54.730> this<00:04:55.730> card<00:04:56.060> has<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.420> benefit<00:04:56.810> of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
that this card has the benefit of

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.550 
that this card has the benefit of
exhausting<00:04:57.530> air<00:04:57.710> directly<00:04:58.100> out<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.790> case

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
exhausting air directly out of the case

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.230 
exhausting air directly out of the case
in<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.740> cramped<00:05:01.130> case<00:05:01.490> that's<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:02.000> huge

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
in a cramped case that's a huge

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.790 
in a cramped case that's a huge
advantage<00:05:02.510> because<00:05:02.870> you're<00:05:03.110> not<00:05:03.230> recycling

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
advantage because you're not recycling

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.590 
advantage because you're not recycling
that<00:05:03.980> hot<00:05:04.130> air<00:05:04.160> however<00:05:04.520> if<00:05:05.000> your<00:05:05.390> case<00:05:05.570> has

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
that hot air however if your case has

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.170 
that hot air however if your case has
decent<00:05:06.320> ventilation<00:05:07.160> such<00:05:07.700> as<00:05:07.850> if<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.060> have

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
decent ventilation such as if you have

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.240 
decent ventilation such as if you have
an<00:05:08.300> antique<00:05:08.630> 1100<00:05:09.320> or<00:05:09.440> some<00:05:09.590> kind<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.890> gaming

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
an antique 1100 or some kind of a gaming

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.970 
an antique 1100 or some kind of a gaming
case<00:05:10.430> like<00:05:10.670> that<00:05:11.200> this<00:05:12.200> is<00:05:12.470> going<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.830> be<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
case like that this is going to be a

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.560 
case like that this is going to be a
huge<00:05:13.250> advantage<00:05:13.370> because<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.060> would<00:05:14.210> perform

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
huge advantage because it would perform

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.440 
huge advantage because it would perform
very<00:05:14.780> similarly<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.650> how<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.920> does<00:05:16.100> on<00:05:16.400> an<00:05:17.000> open

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
very similarly to how it does on an open

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.630 
very similarly to how it does on an open
test<00:05:17.960> bench<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:18.770> hope<00:05:19.220> this<00:05:19.460> has<00:05:19.610> been

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
test bench so I hope this has been

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.820 
test bench so I hope this has been
