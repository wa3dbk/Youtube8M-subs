00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 I'm happy to find you in a 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.550
 new video where we will talk about 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.320
 hair for a very simple reason 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.210
 is that right now my hair I do not 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.769
 support them more I can not stand the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.250
 length I can not stand the fact anymore 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.650
 to be in limay so I tried to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.970
 look for a solution a cure because 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.160
 that when we do not feel well in his 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.530
 hair does not feel good in his head 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.720
 so I conducted the investigation to find out what 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 it was possible that I cut myself 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.650
 hair alone without doing any 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.180
 capillary catastrophe since 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.070
 the last time I got that I got 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.780
 cut my hair was my bangs and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.610
 I will regret for over a year 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.220
 so I found three tips that are 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.070
 nice that are easily achievable 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.010
 for everyone who will allow to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.690
 cut the dry ends and their 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.310
 to give a degraded structure so voila 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.890
 I decided to get wet 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.720
 hair since I have wavy hair 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.220
 if you have straight hair 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.480
 you can do them directly on 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.910
 dry healthy hair 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.680
 I did not choose not to take 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.890
 of risks and do like to to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.040
 hairdressers for for this little moment of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.270
 capillaries you are going to need 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.700
 a breaststroke you will need 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.390
 of a comb so I also use 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.850
 these ci what will allow me to trace 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.440
 precise contours 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.260
 you are going to need a rubber band 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.330
 and of course a pair of scissors 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.570
 so here we go for this 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.970
 new hair adventure 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:03.110
 so for starters I'm going to work my 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.410
 hair I 'm going to work there two 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.410
 battles 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.850
 that's it's done so you go 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:25.280
 come take the elastic and you go 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.709
 you make a ponytail at the level 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.069
 franc I'm going to come cut my 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.300
 hair 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.330
 initially very linearly may 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.970
 prevent reworking one of the small 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.900
 scissors so that's that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.900
 graduates are more beautiful 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.069
 then the cup there we do not see very well 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.880
 because it's wet but it's 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.440
 not bad anyway what I 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.910
 will do for you to see results well 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.010
 subsequently as well as I'm going to dry 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.020
 the hair 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.600
 so we're going to pass the second part and 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.020
 we will actually work the hair of the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.480
 guess so that's when we go 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.720
 come use this or your cart with 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.239
 with a pointed toe and we will come no 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.239
 delimited from one ear to another 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:54.490
 so I come back to him that suddenly my 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.490
 front hop 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.580
 and there I look totally said cube 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.300
 so once that's done you 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.490
 have well delineated at Lorient we are going 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.610
 go back to the serious things it is to 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:18.320
 to say that we will take the scissors and 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:21.200
 so here we will choose moats from 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.460
 our gradient I will start with 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.510
 German falls because I am a 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.980
 little chilly 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.250
 since the last time I 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.510
 I cut my hair alone I 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.890
 had to go back to the hairdresser 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.890
 so instead of saving money 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.910
 I got to have my own trap 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.490
 in addition to that it was a disaster 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.490
 so I'm going to start by cutting here 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:52.029
 what I am in heaven and I have 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:58.729
 shortcut a little bit maybe will choose 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:05:02.779
 party on demand we freeze nice I 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:05.020
 bo has no balls or what is 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:09.860
 you have the balls 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:16.849
 go I run right below the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:19.789
 mouth is there as just now 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:24.520
 I'm going to come and give you little 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:27.520
 scissors up in order to create a 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.520
 irregularity 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:46.080
 now that it's done I let go 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:49.409
 all at first sight it does not seem to me 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.970
 too bad I do not know if you see there the 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:06:00.889
 degrade so as I want to show everything 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.889
 at the time I made from here 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.910
 Oh 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.069
 to finish what you're going to do 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.389
 it is that you have taken small 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.280
 wicks like that hop 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.110
 so we will tackle all 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:31.879
 little forked hair that stays 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:31.879
 again you're coming twisted the wick 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.000
 has passed 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.150
 scissors like those 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.340
 it would be only the first cut 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.550
 that I gave them did to them 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.420
 a lot of good 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.850
 so in fact I really do not need 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.890
 to insist a lot so we will finish 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.260
 by a little straightener like that 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.270
 will allow you to show you the 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.770
 final result 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:02.090
 it will also allow you to be assured 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.770
 and then start your turn then 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.720
 of course if you do this too 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.740
