Tyrone Spong

00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:06.467
Q: Tell us about the fight.

00:00:06.467 --> 00:02:10.523
A: I'm glad I won. This fight had a special meaning for me. Actually, I was injured before and didn't fight for 6 months and I changed my trainer. And I was able to win. I want to thank my team.

Q: Now that you've beaten the heavyweight champ, what are your plans?

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.379
A: It really cheered me up. I'll take the heavyweight title next year, and I want to be in the tournament, too. I will continue to get better and have some great fights.
