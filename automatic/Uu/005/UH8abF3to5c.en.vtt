00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
easily cook or you don't need to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.940 
easily cook or you don't need to
marinate<00:01:53.070> them<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.259> high<00:01:55.259> quality<00:01:55.290> beef

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
marinate them they are high quality beef

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
marinate them they are high quality beef
so<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.060> tender<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so it's going to be very tender you can

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
so it's going to be very tender you can
eat<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> plastic<00:01:59.460> fork<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> knife

eat these with a plastic fork and knife

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.719 
eat these with a plastic fork and knife
so<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> say<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> most<00:02:01.860> flavorful<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
so when I say it's the most flavorful it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.439 
so when I say it's the most flavorful it
is<00:02:03.119> also<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.570> tender<00:02:04.079> steak
