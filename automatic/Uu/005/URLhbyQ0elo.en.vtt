 directly to my channel for months suffered 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.260
 musicians 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.390
 I recommend you visit them 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.030

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.110

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.850
 I press that I have to not have 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:19.160
 because he has the shot 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:23.710
 but you have to say good because then 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.710
 it would be crap 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.560
 well now they go as far as I know the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.530
 Pressure 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.990
 here will start the application do not see 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990
 here 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:57.750
 in the application to start playing 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:02.920
 good what you have are from the version 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.730
 but it 's a kitchen for example animal in 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.250
 the forest has a non- anou version 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.930
 and another thing that I'm going to leave you down in 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.569
 the description as sativa 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.190
 Y 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:22.550
 this is left here, this is to change 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.590
 the sounds of the good general and you 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.800
 come if you want to change the sound of the gta 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.990
 but this is not him do not eliminate him for 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.050
 what 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.919
 in the game of nelson and 20 new sound 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.919
 from busse 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.910
 of car seems 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.650
 and if he gets the more likely it 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.960
 sent an error 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.289
 to which you hold loads 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.789
 so I recommend you do not stop 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.979
 so it works 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.979
 this idea normally 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.680
 well down there I will also leave you in the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.610
 description in the description sorry 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.770
 and a prior 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:19.710
 of the cdh that is for us to see that the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.449
 field 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.740
 so 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.740
 that's outside 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.330
 I hope you liked the tour 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.330

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.669
 and it was created a little 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.270
 I liked 20 and over time 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.310
 I hope it's much more from here I'm going to 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.900
 watch 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:54.070
