00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.110
 a superficial view of the map 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.110
 German 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.220
 in the north flat in the middle mountainous 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.110
 and high mountains to the south 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.350
 we want a superficial look now 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.360
 to deepen something you subdivide 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.230
 Germany so spacious one can 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.970
 differ in north sea baltic and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 coastal north german lowland 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.670
 Mittelgebirgsschwelle southwestern German 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.300
 stratum levels of land alps and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.990
 alpen we see that on the map 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.100
 once to the coastal region on the left 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.810
 the north sea is right the baltic sea the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.850
 North German lowlands join 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.620
 and extends from Lower Saxony to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.020
 Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania over all 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.190
 northern Germany 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.530
 South of a line Hanover 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.979
 Brunswick and Magdeburg begins the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.330
 Mid-mountain threshold in the southwest 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.690
 joins the southwestern German 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.860
 layer scale country 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.700
 south of the Danube begins 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.500
 Alpine foothills in the very south of Bavaria 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 then rises the high mountains of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 Alps 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.240
 essential for the landscapes in 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.070
 europe and in today's germany 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.259
 the glaciers of the last ice ages that 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.450
 So the relief of the landscape 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.149
 of the north German lowland it was of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.189
 the ice masses shaped this spread 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.140
 in the ice age from the north 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.840
 direction scandinavia over all 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.979
 Northern Germany from the glaciers 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.039
 pushed up to the central mountain area 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.299
 in front 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.310
 also the alps and the alpine foreland 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.530
 were made by ice sheets from the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.610
 high mountains and movement of glaciers 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.560
 in its present form that shaped 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.599
 high mountains of the alps are located since 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 many millions of years in such a way 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.150
 mentioned geological development 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.579
 earth plates press against each other and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.190
 let the mountains rise 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:25.560
 the alps count like the himalayas or the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.560
 Caucasus to the younger high mountains 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.690
 the southwestern german layer grades land 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.280
 also called southwest german stages land 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.560
 has been through in millions of years 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.510
 overlay of layers and demolition 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.549
 formed by stages its today 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.709
 Landform is also due to the break 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.030
 The Upper Rhine Graben is characterized by 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.160
 around 35 million years ago the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.109
 German middle mountains belong to the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.480
 Europe's oldest in front of around 350 million 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.190
 years, numerous mountains were created 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.510
 by collision different 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.849
 continental earth plates in front of over 200 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.799
 For millions of years, that was rising and falling 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.190
 Land over and under the 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.190
 Sea level
