00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.160
 this is the year when small traders donate organic cosmetics 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.560
 products with the flavors of the year it's a little brothel east and africa and 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.569
 the Africans any price 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 alongside the labels and official develop since the 60s in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.060
 France had proliferated in recent years 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.750
 tests had more or less serious more or less serious deficiencies in 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.679
 almost all studies show that these quality labels 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.330
 enjoys a confidence rating near consumers greater than 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.279
 that of the big brands so what are these labels that are hiding behind 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.279
 behind fences and actually that judicial inquiry 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.770
 do not hesitate 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.440
 this prior approval 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.030
 what does that mean 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.950
 it is a label it guarantees the quality of products 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.200
 watch them 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 many of our products we deserved red 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 since always the future couple 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.500
 if you suffer 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 inimitable where he has always been the marks that day authentic and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.660
 traditional to lure the barge 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.700
 except that once on the shelf the consumer is not necessarily 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 reassured by these types of speeches 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.210
 it even seems that today the brands would be in the middle of a crisis of 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.850
 trust there is a recent survey 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.380
 published by the ifop that said that for those who demonstrate that more brand 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.400
 only arrive in seventh position 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.200
 as a criterion of consumer reassurance trimming with respect to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 will be able to choose a product and for the choice of the product and the consumer 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 rather referred to a quality label 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.870
 quality labels here is the miracle cure and marketing the solution for 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.960
 reassure consumers worry 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.950
 because it's down certified by organizations a priori unrelated to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.570
 advertisers 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.860
 it's not worth it to get excited either by the process and already say since 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.710
 long time 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.750
 from the 60s this made a number of crises in a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.560
 agricultural field or food 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.600
 as for its part 65% of Christ in the area the area 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.030
 he would appear the red label 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.100
 who started to be 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.860
 broadcasted to guarantee some quality time the beautiful red and white 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.539
 laugh that proves that the most advanced in the world 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.999
 an apple spokesperson significantly more conquering shares 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.670
 and especially the red labels is part of the caste labels and officials 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 in the food field for example today there are cassel among 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.450
 which she raised the registered label of origin to the body the label 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.370
 had for organic farming we have known each other for twenty years 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.370
 this is the beautiful officials will be competing with newcomers 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.030
 - tell you that between the multiplication of food crises and the 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.029
 globalization the institute confide 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.739
 lepage from where the proliferation of london and sydney of any kind supposed 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.709
 certify the speech of marc lépine reassure to better buy the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.530
 consumer will choose a product with reference 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.370
 a label of quality but without necessarily knowing 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.470
 behind this is a real quality labels or diet at 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.230
 cair to an official logo also this is a brand their members oumar 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.230
 collective for example a purely marketing brand 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.579
 it's the big difference between the two is the specifications 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.310
 strict trellis for labels and official is much more flexible 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.619
 when it comes to private logos 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:27.819
 so beware of appearances taking as an example very fashionable organic labels 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.679
 these days 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.130
 on one side the adder sky profit label 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.479
 and the other cosmébio who went just as seriously 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.189
 except that the cosmébio logo actually starts from an association created by 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.799
 professionals in the sector, which brought together, in particular, 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.299
 cosmetics and distributors brief we have already given in terms 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.119
 of independence 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:51.039
 but the labels name official the best known are the famous label of 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.589
 the year it is about flavors and products the technique is always 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.989
 the same it is the consumers who give themselves the reply and all is 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.470
 necessarily objective 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.630
 so I'm actually pretty obvious classic if the flavor products of 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.830
 the year for example his carpet fictitiously tested at the parks ad 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.579
 sir and madam everyone 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.589
 on the stand stakes the promise is unique the taste and that's all nothing about 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.820
 the provenance is on the quality I made a flop 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.820
 what is waiting for agricultural 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.120
 when you elected product of the year these are also consumers who 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.979
 choose everyone except that it's on a simple catalog 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.460
 elected product of the year 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.080
 they are tested here 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.330
 short hallucinatory logos have become so numerous as to make a list 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.539
 exhaustive became a mission a possible 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.680
 difficult also to detect who is hiding behind some of them ap 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.940
 rest that private sky profits 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.940
 these certifications are selling 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.550
 but all the same that the beautiful does not benefit everyone 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.499
 in europe the beauty is imposed 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.960
 standardize perceived quality level and most of 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.050
 brands 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.050
 appear to consumers to be of high quality 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.480
 suddenly the county of crossroads brand distributor when there are high schools 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.800
 developing serious competitor for a big brand as president by 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.300
 example especially if the cheapest if sony 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.240
 said on his side that it is necessary to dig then all these labels would he be in the process 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.629
 to endanger the big brands facing that of earth oven water 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:22.439
 clear 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.400
 to resume accepting the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.610
 I think the public is there dealing with a product distributors even though the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.839
 office 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.389
 I think the franchise of the 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.379
 though 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.520
 she still has a very strong preference 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.860
 in québec he is president and chief executive officer 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.270
 finally it works especially for the big brands that form a 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.889
 true know-how a recipe 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.139
 a hole 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.169
 in Quebec however rich otherwise and optically 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.819
 for major brands that sell more basic products like milk the 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.509
 sugar or spinach ap 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.650
 the beautiful kundé is going to be harder to swallow 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.650
 gold 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.650
 in the end the labels have almost become full marks 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.410
 mark of a new kind that are all weapons available to 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.360
 distributors to tackle 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.509
 as for the great marks taken in this battle the ones that will withstand the 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.930
 the better they are 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.930
 to build a single identity 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.139
 it's a nightmare that's chasing mans
