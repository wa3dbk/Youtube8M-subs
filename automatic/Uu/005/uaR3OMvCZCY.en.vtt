00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.830
 hey anthony here with a new video 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.259
 today i show 3 different images 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.120
 see the biceps and I have two types 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.929
 tricep exercises that I will also leave 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.219
 see 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.020
 the very first exercise that you see here 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.430
 is the maybe choose april 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.370
 I actually pull one up with two 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.500
 arms and I let him go with one arm like that 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.630
 you actually get on the way back 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.700
 200 percent of the weight and then make 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.410
 you destroy that muscle much more 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.840
 eventually if you can no longer you can 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.390
 continue to do with 2 hands so two 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.740
 hands up two hands down and this 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.020
 actually grab the small head of the 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.050
 biceps and is not good enough 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.760
 as the only exercise here we go 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.570
 to the jersey and this is an overhead 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.550
 they 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.050
 tricep exercise with cable and I do this 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.730
 the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.670
 I do this for the big head of the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.489
 tricep so if you want bigger arms 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.559
 This is actually a must to be above your head 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.320
 Exercise for the triceps to do here 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.809
 cloths with a dumbbell and with the jungle 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.659
 is the last version that shows so 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.990
 take a look at what suits you best 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.370
 you do not have to do all three tess 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.110
 has like variety 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.340
 I also show you how wrong it is 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.440
 and that is with the elbows out 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.450
 because then you actually grab one 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.920
 damage with your elbow so take care 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.110
 that he is all pointing well forward 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 and then following exercise is the sitting one 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.030
 bicep twist 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 and this boy with donbass the suit here 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.070
 you basically all head in one 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.830
 so a perfect exercise is like 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.540
 you quickly demolish that bizot and here I grab 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.610
 Also, the outside of the cup which is tricep 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.409
 the leather lol they call it that and that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.979
 do I do with cable know this much 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.049
 you 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.420
 make sure you go up well 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.070
 just past those 90 degrees 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.790
 and now what I also see myself with 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 an arm and that's how you make an arm like the one 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.740
 you should be stronger than that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.979
 do as many repetitions as the others 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.229
 arm 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.479
 and this one just grabs well outside 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.960
 head which is nice and where you get it 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.119
 shape is going to see in your arm last 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.820
 I put a triangle finger behind each other and 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.099
 our myset and they all pack 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.380
 part of your biceps and this is especially 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.140
 the upper part of your biceps 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.670
 call them the spider pulse and you pause 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.450
 om has a top because there you have 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.860
 tension 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.840
 the bottom is actually the muscle 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.240
 rest make sure you give him one to two 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 seconds above friend and if 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.020
 you do this about 10 to 12 repetitions 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.330
 did you go to the next one 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.970
 and these pass in the middle and this one 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.250
 take the big cup from your guiseppe 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.500
 and you do this again for 12 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 repetitions until you are completely broken and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 then you go to the last one and that is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 the preacher curl call it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.780
 and I take it again and again 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.500
 this is actually the last part 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.930
 of your bags so you do that very slowly 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.820
 on the very last part sirat 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.260
 and then go to the top of a leftover 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.330
 actually so you do n't want that 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.530
 constant tension so keep that muscle 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.510
 in the first exercise you mainly have 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.010
 upper part with the second one 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.170
 middle part of your bis because you 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.090
 demolishes and here the bottom part 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.260
 and the combination is really perfect 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.260
 that was him
