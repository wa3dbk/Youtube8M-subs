00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.680
 web video repair yourself in this 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 case the video is dedicated to the welder 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.910
 made with a diesel engine spark plug 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.740
 an overheating spark plug 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.080
 that he no longer showed us in a video 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.020
 previous let's measure the consumption of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.630
 intensity that has the same consumption 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.450
 it is quite high , therefore, as 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.740
 emergency soldiers can serve us 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 but good, most of all the video is for 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.379
 that you see that as a regular welder a 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.199
 it's worth it since the consumption is very high 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.379
 from about 13 14 amps we're going to 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.540
 check the same and now that we measure 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.020
 first of all we will check the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 battery assembly 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.240
 to see if it is in good condition 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.220
 or it really is somewhat low voltage 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.820
 we put in our terminal clamps 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.690
 negative positive terminal 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.110
 we select half volt volts 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.520
 of f 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.520
 we will measure the battery 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.579
 the battery is at 12 as 22 volts 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.360
 so initially it is also the 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.000
 load 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.780
 and so with the tips and we're going to measure the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.990
 intensity consumed 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 by the spark plug we select the scale of 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 amps 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.649
 efe 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.649
 a direct current we will connect 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.540
 we adapt our clamp in perimeter 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.540
 and we plug in 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.920
 as you can see the consumption of the spark plug is 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:04.740
 quite elevated is about 12-14 amps 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.750
 14 empires for some batteries 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.539
 already somewhat important consumption 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.000
 depending on the state of it by 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.950
 So you see what is consuming the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 spark plug imagine in a car when 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.120
 we connect the four what consumes the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.120
 two empires by four 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.870
 and as an assembly for an emergency the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.460
 processes that you have in mind that the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.760
 consumption of a preheating plug 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.750
 it's quite high are about 12 14 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.920
 amps can be 15 and if we do not have 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.470
 a battery that is in good 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 conditions we can not make work 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.800
 the spark plug 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.400
 therefore keep it in mind at the time 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.980
 of CONECT 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.079
 and to be able to take full advantage of the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.810
 welder who showed you in a video 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.849
 previous 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.540
 let's talk if the tip has arrived 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.540
 now on the hbo channel 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.580
 with we are again 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.379
 s the tip heats 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.190
 the intensity goes down a bit but 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.470
 also this is normal because the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 Battery voltage can go down 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.220
 since right now it is not loaded to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.140
 100% 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.570
 I hope the video can be from 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.450
 utility that you see what consumes a 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.970
 glow plug and that you follow 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.600
 visiting the website the videos 9 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.600
 for yourself
