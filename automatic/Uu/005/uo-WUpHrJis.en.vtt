00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
going to be there's code for that if

to<00:01:47.410> get<00:01:47.560> two<00:01:47.679> out<00:01:47.800> of<00:01:47.860> one<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.399> then<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.640> had<00:01:48.940> one

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
to get two out of one and then I had one

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.710 
to get two out of one and then I had one
with<00:01:49.330> some<00:01:49.630> scrap<00:01:50.429> so<00:01:51.429> have<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.940> get<00:01:52.119> those<00:01:52.330> cut

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
with some scrap so have to get those cut

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.990 
with some scrap so have to get those cut
and<00:01:52.929> set<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.800> want<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.009> be<00:01:54.099> very<00:01:54.310> very<00:01:54.550> precise

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
and set you want to be very very precise

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.449 
and set you want to be very very precise
about<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:56.530> these<00:01:57.179> risers<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:58.420> these<00:01:59.459> these

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
about these these risers and these these

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.910 
about these these risers and these these
risers<00:02:00.849> I<00:02:01.390> wanted<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.259> have<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> gap<00:02:02.709> at<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
risers I wanted to have a gap at the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.219 
risers I wanted to have a gap at the
bottom<00:02:03.099> to<00:02:03.429> shed<00:02:03.640> water<00:02:03.849> very<00:02:04.780> similar<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.140> my

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
bottom to shed water very similar to my

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.199 
bottom to shed water very similar to my
existing<00:02:05.619> setup<00:02:05.800> but<00:02:06.009> because<00:02:06.399> my<00:02:06.610> rise<00:02:06.940> was

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
existing setup but because my rise was

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.419 
existing setup but because my rise was
only<00:02:07.390> six<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.929> half<00:02:07.959> inches<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.800> these

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
only six and a half inches and these

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.309 
only six and a half inches and these
boards<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.119> seven<00:02:10.450> eighths<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.989> one

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
boards are like seven eighths to one

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.319 
boards are like seven eighths to one
inch<00:02:11.500> thick<00:02:11.730> depending<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:12.819> how<00:02:12.909> they<00:02:13.060> weather

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
inch thick depending on how they weather

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.210 
inch thick depending on how they weather
I<00:02:13.890> had<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.980> rip<00:02:15.189> off<00:02:15.510> about<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> half<00:02:16.629> inch

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
I had to rip off about a half inch

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
I had to rip off about a half inch
off<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> top<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.910> them<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.720> I'm<00:02:19.020> ripping<00:02:19.410> them

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
off the top of them so I'm ripping them

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.050 
off the top of them so I'm ripping them
off<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.130> screwing<00:02:20.610> them<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.820> as<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.030> go

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
off and then screwing them in as I go

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
off and then screwing them in as I go
but<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> had<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.380> all<00:02:22.770> three<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> these

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
but I had this all three of these

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.790 
but I had this all three of these
stringers<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.910> set<00:02:24.210> up<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> deck<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.140> then

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
stringers to set up on the deck and then

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.660 
stringers to set up on the deck and then
I<00:02:25.950> precisely<00:02:27.590> pre-drilled<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.550> want

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
I precisely pre-drilled you don't want

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.280 
I precisely pre-drilled you don't want
to<00:02:29.730> split<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.210> wood<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.990> end<00:02:31.110> that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
to split this wood on the end that's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
to split this wood on the end that's
even<00:02:32.010> though<00:02:32.220> these<00:02:32.820> are<00:02:33.060> self<00:02:33.300> tapping

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
even though these are self tapping

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.520 
even though these are self tapping
screws<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:35.150> don't<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.420> don't<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> take<00:02:37.350> any

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
screws I don't I don't want to take any

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.200 
screws I don't I don't want to take any
chances<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.100> splitting<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.610> pre-drilled

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
chances of splitting so I pre-drilled

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.180 
chances of splitting so I pre-drilled
them<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:40.050> an<00:02:40.170> eighth<00:02:40.320> inch<00:02:40.350> drill<00:02:40.920> bit<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
them with an eighth inch drill bit and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.670 
them with an eighth inch drill bit and
went<00:02:42.030> from<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.990> made<00:02:43.230> sure<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
went from there and just made sure that

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.730 
went from there and just made sure that
all<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:43.950> ends<00:02:44.580> lined<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.390> exactly<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.230> my

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
all my ends lined up exactly so my

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.190 
all my ends lined up exactly so my
outside<00:02:47.160> edges<00:02:47.310> were<00:02:47.580> flush<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.240> then<00:02:48.990> when<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
outside edges were flush and then when I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.840 
outside edges were flush and then when I
got<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> guy<00:02:49.800> did<00:02:50.250> I've<00:02:50.400> got<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.610> center

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
got this guy did I've got the center

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.180 
got this guy did I've got the center
stringer<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.450> Center<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:52.950> 40

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
stringer right on Center so these are 40

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.010 
stringer right on Center so these are 40
inches<00:02:53.370> wide<00:02:53.430> 20<00:02:54.120> inches<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.360> Mark<00:02:54.600> line<00:02:54.870> down

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
inches wide 20 inches and Mark line down

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.270 
inches wide 20 inches and Mark line down
the<00:02:55.110> middle<00:02:55.170> came<00:02:55.560> down<00:02:55.740> three<00:02:55.950> quarters<00:02:56.190> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the middle came down three quarters of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.440 
the middle came down three quarters of
an<00:02:56.370> inch<00:02:56.430> came<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.850> three<00:02:57.000> quarters<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.360> an

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
an inch came up three quarters of an

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.820 
an inch came up three quarters of an
inch<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:57.810> at<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> half<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.530> marked

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
inch and then at two and a half I marked

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.550 
inch and then at two and a half I marked
it<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.280> five<00:02:59.520> inches<00:03:00.230> tall<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.260> I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
it because this five inches tall so I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.400 
it because this five inches tall so I
got<00:03:01.860> three<00:03:02.250> screws<00:03:02.820> there<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.410> basically

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
got three screws there and basically

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.650 
got three screws there and basically
everything<00:03:05.040> lined<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.430> beautifully<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.150> got

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
everything lined up beautifully and got

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.150 
everything lined up beautifully and got
that<00:03:06.810> set<00:03:07.050> into<00:03:07.170> place<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.100> I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that set into place and I and then I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.680 
that set into place and I and then I
brought<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.459> down<00:03:08.580> off<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.030> deck<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.360> set<00:03:09.600> it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
brought it down off the deck and set it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.180 
brought it down off the deck and set it
into<00:03:09.810> place<00:03:10.050> here<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.920> tie<00:03:11.130> these

into place here so as I tie these

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.210 
into place here so as I tie these
stringers<00:03:11.730> together<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.530> these

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
you're coming to corner posts like this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.960 
you're coming to corner posts like this
these<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:31.769> half-inch<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.489> probably<00:03:32.730> could

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
these are half-inch I probably could

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
these are half-inch I probably could
have<00:03:33.060> gotten<00:03:33.209> away<00:03:33.360> with<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.930> next<00:03:34.080> size<00:03:34.350> down

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
have gotten away with the next size down

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.949 
have gotten away with the next size down
which<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:34.920> what<00:03:35.100> 5/16<00:03:35.940> probably<00:03:36.780> could<00:03:36.900> have

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
which is what 5/16 probably could have

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.560 
which is what 5/16 probably could have
done<00:03:37.019> 5/16<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.440> hex<00:03:40.950> shape<00:03:41.940> it's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
done 5/16 and I like the hex shape it's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.290 
done 5/16 and I like the hex shape it's
very<00:03:42.840> angular<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.700> matches<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
very angular and it kind of matches the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.420 
very angular and it kind of matches the
angles<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.140> deck<00:03:46.440> way<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.830> cut<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.130> into

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
angles of this deck way it's cut up into

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.240 
angles of this deck way it's cut up into
45s<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.420> offsetting<00:03:48.840> angles<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.890> that's<00:03:50.100> why

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
45s and offsetting angles so that's why

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.320 
45s and offsetting angles so that's why
I<00:03:50.280> went<00:03:50.519> with<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.700> hex<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.000> could<00:03:51.150> have<00:03:51.239> gone

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
I went with the hex I could have gone

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.140 
I went with the hex I could have gone
with<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.540> button<00:03:51.840> head<00:03:52.019> okay<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.280> our

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
with the button head okay and our

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.670 
with the button head okay and our
carriage<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.870> think<00:03:55.049> they're<00:03:55.140> called<00:03:55.320> carriage

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
carriage I think they're called carriage

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.170 
carriage I think they're called carriage
bolts<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.180> my<00:03:57.269> existing<00:03:57.750> deck<00:03:58.160> okay

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
bolts just like my existing deck okay

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.310 
bolts just like my existing deck okay
and<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.239> don't<00:04:00.269> have<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.570> use<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> washer<00:04:01.140> I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
and you don't have to use a washer I

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.800 
and you don't have to use a washer I
like<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.580> angular<00:04:02.940> look<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.600> think

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
like that that angular look you think

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.870 
like that that angular look you think
it's<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.110> match<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.470> deck<00:04:04.650> nicely<00:04:05.070> but

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
it's going to match the deck nicely but

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.789 
it's going to match the deck nicely but
yes<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.420> you're<00:04:06.600> getting<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> corners<00:04:07.680> you

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
yes if you're getting to the corners you

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.430 
yes if you're getting to the corners you
really<00:04:08.100> need<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.430> offset<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.230> then

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
really need to offset these and then

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.620 
really need to offset these and then
what<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.190> mean<00:04:11.340> by<00:04:11.430> offset<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:12.000> you'll<00:04:12.480> notice

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
what I mean by offset is you'll notice

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.380 
what I mean by offset is you'll notice
these<00:04:13.440> two<00:04:13.769> are<00:04:13.980> higher<00:04:14.310> than<00:04:14.610> these<00:04:14.850> two<00:04:15.150> and

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
these two are higher than these two and

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.599 
these two are higher than these two and
they<00:04:16.200> splay<00:04:16.709> each<00:04:16.919> other<00:04:17.100> because<00:04:17.340> where<00:04:17.489> they

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
they splay each other because where they

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.180 
they splay each other because where they
meet<00:04:17.850> inside<00:04:18.299> remember<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.260> blocked<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.950> in

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
meet inside remember I blocked this in

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.580 
meet inside remember I blocked this in
and<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.570> beam<00:04:21.840> here<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.440> to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and I have this beam here you have to

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.750 
and I have this beam here you have to
leave<00:04:22.740> yourself<00:04:22.890> enough<00:04:23.130> room<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.700> your

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
leave yourself enough room to get your

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.150 
leave yourself enough room to get your
hand<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.419> there<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.830> see<00:04:25.979> how<00:04:26.099> you

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
hand up in there and you can see how you

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.890 
hand up in there and you can see how you
have<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.550> stagger<00:04:26.820> those<00:04:27.150> if<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.419> don't<00:04:27.479> and

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
have to stagger those if you don't and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.890 
have to stagger those if you don't and
you're<00:04:28.890> off<00:04:29.070> by<00:04:29.280> like<00:04:29.460> an<00:04:29.580> eighth<00:04:29.729> of<00:04:29.880> an<00:04:30.000> inch

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
you're off by like an eighth of an inch

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.820 
you're off by like an eighth of an inch
you're<00:04:31.139> not<00:04:31.260> gonna<00:04:31.350> be<00:04:31.440> able<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.680> turn<00:04:31.800> your

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you're not gonna be able to turn your

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.520 
you're not gonna be able to turn your
bolt<00:04:32.160> heads<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.120> pay<00:04:33.600> very<00:04:33.870> very<00:04:33.990> careful

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
bolt heads so pay very very careful

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.520 
bolt heads so pay very very careful
attention<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.949> your<00:04:35.130> corners<00:04:36.320> that's<00:04:37.320> about

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
attention to your corners that's about

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.750 
attention to your corners that's about
it<00:04:37.710> really<00:04:37.860> I'm<00:04:38.190> just<00:04:38.220> going<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.460> work<00:04:38.580> my<00:04:38.730> way

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
it really I'm just going to work my way

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.080 
it really I'm just going to work my way
around<00:04:39.560> do<00:04:40.560> each<00:04:40.770> post<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.370> got<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.820> stairs

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
around do each post I got to the stairs

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.560 
around do each post I got to the stairs
post<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:43.440> set<00:04:43.860> these<00:04:44.040> two<00:04:44.280> large<00:04:44.550> post<00:04:44.880> first<00:04:45.240> I

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
post I set these two large post first I

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.270 
post I set these two large post first I
had<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.139> read<00:04:46.320> IgG<00:04:46.470> these<00:04:46.650> holes<00:04:46.919> I<00:04:47.100> had<00:04:47.220> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
had to read IgG these holes I had to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.830 
had to read IgG these holes I had to
spread<00:04:47.550> this<00:04:47.669> out<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.030> set<00:04:48.150> concrete<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.720> this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
spread this out and set concrete in this

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.060 
spread this out and set concrete in this
morning<00:04:49.139> for<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.320> very<00:04:49.500> first<00:04:49.710> thing<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.919> did

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
morning for the very first thing I did

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.460 
morning for the very first thing I did
was<00:04:50.160> set<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.460> concrete<00:04:51.080> retake<00:04:52.080> these<00:04:52.229> holes

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
was set this concrete retake these holes

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.020 
was set this concrete retake these holes
and<00:04:52.650> set<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.860> concrete<00:04:53.310> out<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.610> knew<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:53.940> was

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
and set the concrete out I knew that was

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.210 
and set the concrete out I knew that was
going<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.270> an<00:04:54.360> issue<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.290> on<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> backfill<00:04:55.949> I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
going to be an issue so on a backfill I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.950 
going to be an issue so on a backfill I
could<00:04:56.970> probably<00:04:57.120> backfill<00:04:57.540> most<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:57.930> now

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
could probably backfill most of it now

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.940 
could probably backfill most of it now
as<00:04:58.380> is<00:05:00.740> 7<00:05:01.740> placing<00:05:02.220> sewers<00:05:02.550> all<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.850> folks<00:05:03.950> can

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
as is 7 placing sewers all the folks can

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.810 
as is 7 placing sewers all the folks can
remember<00:05:05.100> there's<00:05:05.370> going<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.520> be<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.639> nose<00:05:07.820> nose

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
remember there's going to be a nose nose

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.710 
remember there's going to be a nose nose
is<00:05:09.000> going<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.210> those<00:05:09.660> over<00:05:10.080> about<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.530> half<00:05:10.800> inch

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
is going to those over about a half inch

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.860 
is going to those over about a half inch
and<00:05:12.720> then<00:05:12.840> there's<00:05:12.990> going<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.350> spacer

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
and then there's going to be a spacer

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.770 
and then there's going to be a spacer
guard<00:05:15.870> gap<00:05:16.139> just<00:05:16.440> like<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> deck<00:05:19.190> alright

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
guard gap just like on the deck alright

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.469 
guard gap just like on the deck alright
so<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.810> look<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.110> little<00:05:22.229> something<00:05:22.650> like<00:05:23.220> that

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
so I look a little something like that

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.240 
so I look a little something like that
and<00:05:24.479> then<00:05:25.110> up<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.410> next<00:05:25.620> one<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:25.950> this<00:05:26.070> way

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
and then up to the next one so this way

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.219 
and then up to the next one so this way
there's<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.729> little<00:05:26.940> bit<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.180> an<00:05:27.300> air<00:05:27.419> gap<00:05:27.660> okay

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
there's a little bit of an air gap okay

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.719 
there's a little bit of an air gap okay
and<00:05:28.860> everything<00:05:29.280> can<00:05:29.400> shed<00:05:29.610> water<00:05:29.789> nicely<00:05:30.440> so

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
and everything can shed water nicely so

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.110 
and everything can shed water nicely so
again<00:05:32.729> number<00:05:33.270> one<00:05:33.650> killer<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.770> wood<00:05:35.669> is<00:05:35.910> is

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
again number one killer of wood is is

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.469 
again number one killer of wood is is
moisture<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.870> rot<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.250> if<00:05:38.789> it's<00:05:39.090> not<00:05:39.240> pressure

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
moisture and rot so if it's not pressure

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.000 
moisture and rot so if it's not pressure
treated<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.200> even<00:05:40.410> if<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:40.620> is<00:05:40.740> pressure

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
treated and even if it is pressure

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.620 
treated and even if it is pressure
treated<00:05:41.340> try<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.639> get<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:41.910> to<00:05:42.000> shed<00:05:42.210> water<00:05:42.389> as

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
treated try to get it to shed water as

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.879 
treated try to get it to shed water as
best<00:05:42.870> as<00:05:42.990> possible<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.560> don't<00:05:43.710> want<00:05:43.830> it

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
best as possible you don't want it

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.610 
best as possible you don't want it
sitting<00:05:44.130> saturated<00:05:45.030> in<00:05:45.150> water<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:46.080> will<00:05:46.139> rot

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
sitting saturated in water it will rot

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.089 
sitting saturated in water it will rot
over<00:05:46.919> time<00:05:48.169> alright<00:05:49.169> our<00:05:49.500> stairs<00:05:49.800> are<00:05:49.950> ready

to hit these two posts

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.219 
to hit these two posts
okay<00:06:31.860> then<00:06:32.130> those<00:06:32.340> two<00:06:32.639> corner<00:06:33.000> posts<00:06:33.389> there's

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
okay then those two corner posts there's

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.260 
okay then those two corner posts there's
one<00:06:34.440> in<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:34.620> middle<00:06:34.860> here<00:06:35.070> got<00:06:35.280> a<00:06:35.310> once<00:06:36.060> I<00:06:36.120> get

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
one in the middle here got a once I get

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.140 
one in the middle here got a once I get
this<00:06:36.389> in<00:06:36.599> set<00:06:36.930> I<00:06:37.169> get<00:06:37.919> this<00:06:38.099> corner<00:06:38.400> set<00:06:38.729> I'll

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
this in set I get this corner set I'll

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.550 
this in set I get this corner set I'll
measure<00:06:39.450> between<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.960> two<00:06:40.140> find<00:06:40.500> the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
measure between the two find the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.650 
measure between the two find the
midpoint<00:06:41.000> as<00:06:42.000> long<00:06:42.210> as<00:06:42.330> it<00:06:42.419> doesn't<00:06:42.570> fall<00:06:42.840> in

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
midpoint as long as it doesn't fall in

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.920 
midpoint as long as it doesn't fall in
screws<00:06:43.990> with<00:06:44.230> these<00:06:44.380> joists<00:06:44.680> are<00:06:44.950> I'll<00:06:45.370> just

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
screws with these joists are I'll just

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.510 
screws with these joists are I'll just
I'll<00:06:46.930> put<00:06:47.140> it<00:06:47.230> where<00:06:47.350> it<00:06:47.380> lies<00:06:47.620> if<00:06:47.920> it<00:06:48.040> lies

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
I'll put it where it lies if it lies

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.860 
I'll put it where it lies if it lies
right<00:06:48.790> on<00:06:48.850> top<00:06:49.090> of<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.270> screws<00:06:49.540> I'll<00:06:49.690> have<00:06:49.780> to

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
right on top of the screws I'll have to

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.360 
right on top of the screws I'll have to
decide<00:06:50.350> one<00:06:50.530> way<00:06:50.560> or<00:06:50.680> the<00:06:50.800> other<00:06:50.860> was<00:06:51.100> going<00:06:51.280> to

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
decide one way or the other was going to

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.890 
decide one way or the other was going to
go<00:06:51.460> and<00:06:52.300> then<00:06:53.170> this<00:06:53.710> is<00:06:53.890> predetermined<00:06:54.900> that's

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
go and then this is predetermined that's

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.270 
go and then this is predetermined that's
a<00:06:56.580> you<00:06:57.580> know<00:06:57.700> that<00:06:57.960> cross<00:06:58.960> blocking<00:06:59.470> for<00:06:59.980> that

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
a you know that cross blocking for that

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.370 
a you know that cross blocking for that
post<00:07:00.610> there<00:07:00.970> so<00:07:01.780> one<00:07:02.590> two<00:07:03.070> three<00:07:03.970> four<00:07:04.380> five
