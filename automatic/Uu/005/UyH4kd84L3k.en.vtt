this grade at one time I asked my

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.470 
this grade at one time I asked my
landscaper<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.880> make<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.300> 2%<00:01:30.020> grade<00:01:31.270> he<00:01:32.270> gave

landscaper to make it a 2% grade he gave

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.180 
landscaper to make it a 2% grade he gave
me<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.660> two<00:01:32.870> degree<00:01:33.050> grade<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:36.560> might<00:01:36.770> see<00:01:36.980> the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
me a two degree grade you might see the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.610 
me a two degree grade you might see the
