00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.000
 godÃ­a and telecommunications a server asks that we have done 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.979
 as every week we will be addressing different issues 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.690
 the first of which refers to the total number of cell phones 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.399
 what's in the world 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.029
 according to the most recent data of the international union of 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.719
 telecommunications there are more than one thousand 400 million cell phones in 

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:21.529
 all the world 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.079
 an extraordinary amount if we make analogies that it would be the equivalent 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.669
 to more than 170 times the total population of our country 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.570
 The second concern that we will be sharing with you concerns 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.700
 When the phone arrived in our country, Dominican Republic 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 the telephone arrives the Dominican Republic on January 7, 1886 when 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.790
 preston dinners or inaugurate the first telephone exchange achieving the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.660
 communication with the school san luis gonzaga where the rector of this school 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 he used the expression well for progress 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.680
 to start one of the most extraordinary eras in history the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.290
 telecommunications technology in our country 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.430
 the third concern refers to that is the model the mobile is the device 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.060
 that makes it possible for computers to connect to the internet 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.740
 since the modem allow modulate you want to move from there the initials of mobile manages 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.130
 that the digital signals of the computer are converted into analog signals 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.020
 which is modular and then those analog signals are converted into 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.940
 digital in the target computer that this mural the combination of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.420
 modulation of emulation in what makes montilla and his word possible 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.650
 The other concern that we will be sharing is that you listen 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.630
 a chip is a silicon device and abuses 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.490
 where there are millions of transistors 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.220
 that combined a set of circuits that have made minutiae possible 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.740
 deterrence of all electronic components that we use 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.990
 Cell phones are smaller cameras of television recording 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.430
 stb grace the existence of the cid 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.830
 and finally we will be sharing with you that it is a portable memory 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.670
 for a trance power to convey information or data in order to a 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.640
 computer to another has generally been possible to use bishkek 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 currently there are portable memories where you can store 13 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.910
 512 up to a giga d information 512 megabytes up to a day there of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.910
 information what would be the equivalent of more than 10 thousand 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.149
 the discreet 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.870
 equivalent one can have recorded in his memory this 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.630
 this is surprising since it allows one to handle a large amount of data and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.469
 so I can transport it 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.359
 so far the varied content its cyt section 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.120
 I speak to them and that the moroso continue to enjoy their agenda 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.870
 until next time
