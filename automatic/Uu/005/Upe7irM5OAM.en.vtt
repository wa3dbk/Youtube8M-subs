00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
think that vortex it's really neat be

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.289 
think that vortex it's really neat be
all<00:04:17.239> too<00:04:17.599> proud<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.019> be<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.829> good<00:04:19.099> player<00:04:19.400> but<00:04:19.729> i

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
all too proud to be a good player but i

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.870 
all too proud to be a good player but i
think<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:20.810> if<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.049> try<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.500> go<00:04:22.490> from<00:04:22.759> the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
think that if you try to go from the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.210 
think that if you try to go from the
first<00:04:23.360> checklist<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:24.440> difficult<00:04:24.889> because<00:04:24.949> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
first checklist is difficult because the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.980 
first checklist is difficult because the
level<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.580> not<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:26.060> tough<00:04:26.300> like<00:04:26.599> in<00:04:26.750> other

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
level it's not that tough like in other

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.900 
level it's not that tough like in other
countries<00:04:27.470> in<00:04:27.590> europe<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.400> maybe<00:04:28.580> for<00:04:28.849> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
countries in europe so maybe for the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.120 
countries in europe so maybe for the
young<00:04:29.090> guys<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.810> grow<00:04:30.080> up<00:04:30.169> in<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:30.770> team<00:04:30.979> when

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
young guys to grow up in this team when

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.060 
young guys to grow up in this team when
they<00:04:31.780> will<00:04:32.780> play<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.229> future<00:04:33.560> ago<00:04:33.800> or

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
they will play in the future ago or

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.890 
they will play in the future ago or
campaign<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.729> future<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:36.050> maybe<00:04:37.900> maybe

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
campaign in the future so maybe maybe

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.890 
campaign in the future so maybe maybe
it's<00:04:39.080> better<00:04:39.490> what<00:04:40.490> what<00:04:40.909> is<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.120> about<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900
