00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.900
 in the championship 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 in 2008, astronomers x had announced 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 the discovery of a new exoplanet attempt 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.449
 fomolgout star close to us 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.820
 called fomolgout bingo new world 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.839
 moved the barbecue inside the ring of dust and 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.519
 wreckage fight was declared first 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.800
 exoplanets that have been observed directly 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 the visual range was then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.260
 per month 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.890
 now recently several teams 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 astronomers questioned the fact that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.670
 fomalgaut bit in general is the foundations of the planets 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.590
 the biggest disappointment was 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.190
 something that in the twelfth year failed 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.130
 detect its thermal radiation 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 football in may dolby can remember 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.790
 and now he's resurrected 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.610
 new h2 snapshot analysis in 2004 2006 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.170
 return the aircraft without the status of the planet I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.060
 I assume that she can belong to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 one rare exoplanet type as well 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 Object 7 is obviously an object underway with 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.900
 the right speed and in the right 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 direction so that you can explain 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.750
 end properties including ingrowths 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050
 the thick star itself is dusty 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.300
 cloud brothers could survive would it not be 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.550
 associated with planet 1 and failures with 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.130
 fomalgaut obi detection 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.610
 infrared throughout 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.369
 Visibility suggests that the mass of the planet 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.410
 less than thought about two times 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.370
 less than the mass of Jupiter 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.640
 one more team observed system 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.070
 with the help of the hub this year and will publish 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.170
 your results very soon 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.580
 accomplices so keep the children at 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.979
 imagine he fomorgut battle for the planet 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.060
 the zombies went off again 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 around its star of the month 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.159
 but how
