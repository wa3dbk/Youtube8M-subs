be<00:03:32.800> your<00:03:32.980> air<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> air<00:03:33.670> filter<00:03:34.210> and<00:03:34.990> you're

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
be your air to air filter and you're

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.020 
be your air to air filter and you're
gonna<00:03:35.320> pop<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.740> cap<00:03:35.950> off<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.550> pull<00:03:36.910> it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
gonna pop the cap off of this pull it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.600 
gonna pop the cap off of this pull it
out<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:38.230> want<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.440> examine<00:03:38.710> that<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
out you want to examine that in the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.180 
out you want to examine that in the
light<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.240> tap<00:03:40.750> out<00:03:40.930> any<00:03:41.080> dust<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:41.680> inside

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
light and tap out any dust that's inside

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.430 
light and tap out any dust that's inside
then<00:03:42.580> put<00:03:43.210> it<00:03:43.330> back<00:03:43.360> analyst<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.050> overly

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
then put it back analyst it's overly

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600 
then put it back analyst it's overly
dirty<00:03:44.650> then<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.890> want<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.160> replace<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
dirty then you want to replace it

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.430 
dirty then you want to replace it
entirely<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:46.930> finally<00:03:47.260> you're<00:03:47.350> gonna

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
entirely and then finally you're gonna

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.990 
entirely and then finally you're gonna
be<00:03:47.560> checking<00:03:47.710> your<00:03:47.980> electrical<00:03:48.460> harness<00:03:48.850> for

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
be checking your electrical harness for

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.790 
be checking your electrical harness for
any<00:03:49.120> kind<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.330> corrosion<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:50.590> can<00:03:50.740> be

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
any kind of corrosion that can be

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.110 
any kind of corrosion that can be
running<00:03:51.070> through<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.340> engine<00:03:51.610> block<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
running through the engine block and you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.580 
running through the engine block and you
can<00:03:52.240> see<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.660> truck<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.080> fairly<00:03:53.290> dirty

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
can see in this truck it's fairly dirty

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.250 
can see in this truck it's fairly dirty
this<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.130> trash<00:03:54.430> hauler<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.450> this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
this is a trash hauler and so this

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.170 
this is a trash hauler and so this
doesn't<00:03:56.470> seem<00:03:56.680> necessary<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.550> lot<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.790> plowing

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
doesn't seem necessary a lot of plowing

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.550 
doesn't seem necessary a lot of plowing
yourself<00:03:58.570> but<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.840> sees<00:03:58.990> a<00:03:59.020> lot<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.380> garbage

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
yourself but it sees a lot of garbage

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.530 
yourself but it sees a lot of garbage
and<00:03:59.860> debris<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.550> basic<00:04:00.910> my<00:04:01.060> build<00:04:01.330> up

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
and debris and just basic my build up

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.360 
and debris and just basic my build up
and<00:04:02.050> so<00:04:02.500> you're<00:04:02.620> gonna<00:04:02.710> want<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.010> keep<00:04:03.100> an<00:04:03.280> eye

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
and so you're gonna want to keep an eye

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.440 
and so you're gonna want to keep an eye
on<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.640> inside<00:04:04.030> your<00:04:04.180> engine<00:04:04.300> compartment

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
on that inside your engine compartment

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.970 
on that inside your engine compartment
to<00:04:04.870> make<00:04:05.020> sure<00:04:05.140> that's<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.410> affecting

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
to make sure that's not affecting

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.979 
to make sure that's not affecting
performance<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.670> engine<00:04:07.030> or<00:04:07.600> causing

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
performance of the engine or causing

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.330 
performance of the engine or causing
premature<00:04:08.160> wear

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
premature wear

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.460 
premature wear
so<00:04:11.090> again<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.540> basic<00:04:11.870> walk<00:04:12.050> around<00:04:12.380> on

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
so again that's the basic walk around on

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.290 
so again that's the basic walk around on
the<00:04:12.560> engine<00:04:12.800> compartment<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.940> only<00:04:14.120> took

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
the engine compartment this only took

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.060 
the engine compartment this only took
this<00:04:14.450> about<00:04:14.750> four<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.230> half<00:04:15.290> minutes<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:15.920> do

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
this about four and a half minutes to do

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.300 
this about four and a half minutes to do
and<00:04:17.320> once<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.410> get<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.650> hang<00:04:18.830> of<00:04:18.950> this<00:04:19.100> this

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
and once you get the hang of this this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.560 
and once you get the hang of this this
is<00:04:19.430> actually<00:04:19.760> something<00:04:19.940> should<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.240> take<00:04:20.450> you

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
is actually something should I take you

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.450 
is actually something should I take you
about<00:04:20.690> 30<00:04:20.990> to<00:04:21.140> 40<00:04:21.410> seconds<00:04:21.800> to<00:04:21.890> put<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.220> power

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
about 30 to 40 seconds to put the power

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.880 
about 30 to 40 seconds to put the power
through<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.060> then<00:04:23.180> move<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.510> dear<00:04:23.780> cab<00:04:24.530> check

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
through and then move on dear cab check

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.440 
through and then move on dear cab check
and<00:04:25.160> then<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> basic<00:04:25.550> Walker<00:04:25.970> out<00:04:26.270> of<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
and then a basic Walker out of the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.870 
and then a basic Walker out of the
entire<00:04:26.720> body<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.140> your<00:04:27.350> truck<00:04:27.590> as<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.610> said<00:04:28.760> the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
entire body of your truck as I said the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.520 
entire body of your truck as I said the
beginning<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.420> check<00:04:29.690> your<00:04:29.840> local<00:04:29.960> state

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
beginning of this check your local state

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.800 
beginning of this check your local state
government<00:04:31.420> requirements<00:04:32.420> in<00:04:32.510> each<00:04:32.600> one<00:04:32.750> of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
government requirements in each one of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.120 
government requirements in each one of
your<00:04:33.020> own<00:04:33.140> handbooks<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:33.950> necessary

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
your own handbooks for what is necessary

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.980 
your own handbooks for what is necessary
to<00:04:34.520> check<00:04:34.730> but<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.180> just<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.450> very<00:04:35.660> simple

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
to check but this is just a very simple

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.780 
to check but this is just a very simple
and<00:04:36.410> basic<00:04:36.680> overview<00:04:37.460> on<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:40.610> will

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
and basic overview on this this will

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.310 
and basic overview on this this will
give<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.090> some<00:04:41.270> basic<00:04:41.660> ideas<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.200> what

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
give you just some basic ideas of what

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.110 
give you just some basic ideas of what
to<00:04:42.350> do<00:04:42.620> but<00:04:42.920> in<00:04:43.340> most<00:04:43.520> states<00:04:43.640> this<00:04:43.970> would

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
to do but in most states this would

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.260 
to do but in most states this would
actually<00:04:44.800> probably<00:04:45.800> pass

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
actually probably pass

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.349 
actually probably pass
