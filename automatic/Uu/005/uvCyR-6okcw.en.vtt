00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110 

shows<00:00:00.359> how<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.750> can<00:00:00.960> find<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:02.310> median<00:00:02.879> and

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
shows how you can find the median and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:13.940 
shows how you can find the median and
the<00:00:03.470> mode<00:00:04.490> for<00:00:05.490> sets<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.890> data<00:00:12.590> we'll<00:00:13.590> look<00:00:13.740> at

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the mode for sets of data we'll look at

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.640 
the mode for sets of data we'll look at
the<00:00:14.099> mode<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.480> mode<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.900> simple<00:00:16.470> way

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the mode first the mode is a simple way

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.000 
the mode first the mode is a simple way
of<00:00:16.890> getting<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:18.000> average<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:19.170> some<00:00:19.380> data<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of getting a average for some data and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.380 
of getting a average for some data and
the<00:00:20.730> mode<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.539> most<00:00:22.170> frequent<00:00:23.119> number<00:00:24.119> in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the mode is the most frequent number in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.710 
the mode is the most frequent number in
the<00:00:24.600> data<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> mode<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the data so if you want the mode of this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.680 
the data so if you want the mode of this
data<00:00:28.429> then<00:00:29.429> quite<00:00:30.119> clearly<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.199> three<00:00:32.690> occurs

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
data then quite clearly the three occurs

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.490 
data then quite clearly the three occurs
most<00:00:34.410> frequently<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> mode<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.820> equal<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
most frequently so the mode is equal to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.319 
most frequently so the mode is equal to
three

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
three

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.690 
three
it<00:00:42.329> occurs<00:00:42.629> four<00:00:42.930> times<00:00:45.980> now<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> second

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it occurs four times now for the second

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
it occurs four times now for the second
set<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> data<00:00:48.590> know<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.829> number<00:00:50.329> occurs<00:00:51.649> more

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
set of data know what number occurs more

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.180 
set of data know what number occurs more
than<00:00:52.710> once

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
than once

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.689 
than once
there<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.940> no<00:00:54.239> most<00:00:54.930> frequent<00:00:55.500> number<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.610> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there is no most frequent number so in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.979 
there is no most frequent number so in
this<00:00:56.850> case<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.100> no<00:00:59.239> mode<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this case there is no mode and then in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.429 
this case there is no mode and then in
the<00:01:04.080> third<00:01:04.320> example<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> three<00:01:06.960> occurs<00:01:07.260> only

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the third example the three occurs only

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.820 
the third example the three occurs only
once<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.790> five<00:01:09.119> under<00:01:09.780> seven<00:01:10.170> occur

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
once but the five under seven occur

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210 
once but the five under seven occur
three<00:01:11.400> times<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.710> case<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.159> are

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
three times so in this case there are

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.359 
three times so in this case there are
two<00:01:14.369> modes<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.119> mode<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:17.220> equal<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> five<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
two modes the mode is equal to five and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.600 
two modes the mode is equal to five and
seven

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.590 

so<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.210> mode<00:01:26.480> is<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.870> most<00:01:27.100> frequent<00:01:28.100> number

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
so the mode is the most frequent number

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.060 
so the mode is the most frequent number
the<00:01:29.600> median<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.950> middle<00:01:31.220> number<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.890> we've

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
the median is the middle number so we've

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.880 
the median is the middle number so we've
got<00:01:34.190> five<00:01:34.520> sets<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.450> data<00:01:35.600> here<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.290> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
got five sets of data here and the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.380 
got five sets of data here and the
number<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.730> middle<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.600> eight<00:01:40.390> sometimes

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
number in the middle is eight sometimes

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.550 
number in the middle is eight sometimes
it's<00:01:41.600> easy<00:01:41.750> when<00:01:41.960> you've<00:01:42.050> got<00:01:42.140> lots<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.440> them

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's easy when you've got lots of them

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.420 
it's easy when you've got lots of them
was<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.830> sort<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.040> count<00:01:43.340> in<00:01:43.610> from<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.660> outside

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
was to sort of count in from the outside

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.700 
was to sort of count in from the outside
until<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.490> find<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.420> center<00:01:47.600> number<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.620> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
until you find the center number but the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.630 
until you find the center number but the
median<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.910> this<00:01:50.030> case<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.600> equal<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.860> eight

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
median in this case is equal to eight

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.790 
median in this case is equal to eight
the<00:01:53.300> central<00:01:53.840> number<00:01:55.570> now<00:01:56.570> sometimes<00:01:57.080> when

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the central number now sometimes when

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.719 
the central number now sometimes when
you<00:01:57.950> got<00:01:58.130> even<00:01:59.050> number<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:00.110> datas<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:01.310> example

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
you got even number of datas for example

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.290 
you got even number of datas for example
when<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.510> count<00:02:02.870> in<00:02:03.530> from<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.550> outside<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
when you count in from the outside you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.400 
when you count in from the outside you
find<00:02:06.050> there<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.229> two<00:02:07.119> central<00:02:08.119> numbers<00:02:11.410> when

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
find there are two central numbers when

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.960 
find there are two central numbers when
this<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.680> case<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.270> 10<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.320> 15

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
this is the case you have a 10 and a 15

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.330 
this is the case you have a 10 and a 15
to<00:02:16.970> find<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.360> median<00:02:17.750> we<00:02:18.350> get<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> center<00:02:19.160> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
to find the median we get the center of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.050 
to find the median we get the center of
these<00:02:19.850> two<00:02:20.600> numbers

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
these two numbers

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.510 
these two numbers
now<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> find<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.709> 10<00:02:25.280> plus<00:02:25.850> 15<00:02:26.300> and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
now to find this you do 10 plus 15 and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:37.060 
now to find this you do 10 plus 15 and
then<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.230> 25<00:02:31.000> 2<00:02:32.000> which<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:34.780> 12.5<00:02:36.070> so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
then have it so 25 2 which is 12.5 so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.600 
then have it so 25 2 which is 12.5 so
the<00:02:37.130> median<00:02:37.519> is<00:02:39.580> 12.5<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.190> first<00:02:43.489> two

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the median is 12.5 now in the first two

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.580 
the median is 12.5 now in the first two
examples<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.330> numbers<00:02:44.630> were<00:02:44.780> ordered

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
examples the numbers were ordered

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.350 
examples the numbers were ordered
now<00:02:46.340> when<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.610> numbers<00:02:46.880> given<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.330> out

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
now when the numbers given to you out

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.410 
now when the numbers given to you out
all<00:02:47.750> ordered<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.709> first<00:02:49.040> step<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.880> order

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
all ordered the first step is to order

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.030 
all ordered the first step is to order
the<00:02:50.600> numbers<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.709> 2<00:02:53.980> 3

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.309 

five<00:02:58.920> six<00:03:00.599> eight<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.969> twelve<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:05.019> quite

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
five six eight and twelve it's quite

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.259 
five six eight and twelve it's quite
easy<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.680> forget<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.519> all<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> numbers<00:03:07.090> when

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
easy to forget to all the numbers when

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.009 
easy to forget to all the numbers when
you<00:03:07.299> were<00:03:07.450> depression

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
you were depression

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.429 
you were depression
now<00:03:08.739> once<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.640> mums<00:03:09.819> are<00:03:09.939> ordered<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:11.019> count

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
now once the mums are ordered you count

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.240 
now once the mums are ordered you count
in<00:03:11.920> from<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.760> outside<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.079> five<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.890> six

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
in from the outside it's a five and six

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.929 
in from the outside it's a five and six
there<00:03:15.849> were<00:03:15.939> two<00:03:16.260> central<00:03:17.260> members<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.220> the

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
there were two central members and the

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.619 
there were two central members and the
number<00:03:19.269> half<00:03:19.840> between<00:03:20.140> these<00:03:20.379> two<00:03:20.500> numbers<00:03:20.829> is

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
number half between these two numbers is

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.250 
number half between these two numbers is
five<00:03:22.629> point<00:03:23.560> five<00:03:24.159> again<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.720> shor<00:03:25.959> add

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
five point five again if and shor add

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.300 
five point five again if and shor add
them<00:03:26.620> together<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.250> divide<00:03:27.400> by<00:03:28.030> two<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
them together and divide by two so the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.509 
them together and divide by two so the
mode<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.480> most<00:03:31.659> frequent<00:03:32.500> number<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
mode is the most frequent number the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.750 
mode is the most frequent number the
medium<00:03:33.879> is<00:03:34.659> number<00:03:35.049> in<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.200> center<00:03:35.760> when

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
medium is number in the center when

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.099 
medium is number in the center when
there's<00:03:36.879> an<00:03:36.939> odd<00:03:37.180> number<00:03:37.689> of<00:03:37.720> numbers

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
there's an odd number of numbers

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.159 
there's an odd number of numbers
there's<00:03:38.709> always<00:03:38.859> an<00:03:39.189> exact<00:03:39.700> median<00:03:40.150> when<00:03:41.019> it's

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
there's always an exact median when it's

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.379 
there's always an exact median when it's
an<00:03:41.230> even<00:03:41.709> number<00:03:41.889> of<00:03:42.220> numbers<00:03:42.400> there<00:03:43.030> were<00:03:43.120> two

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
an even number of numbers there were two

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.390 
an even number of numbers there were two
and<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.349> find<00:03:44.560> there<00:03:44.709> within<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.980> midpoint

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
and you find there within the midpoint

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.759 
and you find there within the midpoint
of<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:46.510> number<00:03:46.750> half<00:03:46.930> half<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.439> between<00:03:47.650> those

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
of the number half half of between those

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.339 
of the number half half of between those
two<00:03:47.889> numbers<00:03:47.970> twelve<00:03:48.970> point<00:03:49.180> five<00:03:49.359> or<00:03:49.659> five

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
two numbers twelve point five or five

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.769 
two numbers twelve point five or five
point<00:03:50.590> five
