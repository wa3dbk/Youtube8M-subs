00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
at that moment so I think that's okay

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.360 
at that moment so I think that's okay
but<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> other<00:02:23.800> people<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.220> were<00:02:24.310> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
but at the other people that were just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
but at the other people that were just
using<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.330> fear<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
using it because of the fear of the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.960 
using it because of the fear of the
interaction<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> fear<00:02:27.940> of

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
interaction and of the fear of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.340 
interaction and of the fear of
commitment<00:02:28.330> then<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.050> more<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
commitment then that is more of the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.530 
commitment then that is more of the
mentality<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.130> boy<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.300> could<00:02:31.420> be

mentality of the boy and it could be

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.750 
mentality of the boy and it could be

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.770 
involved with the fact of the pain
aspect<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.850> think<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.270> first<00:05:09.540> stage

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
aspect I think the first stage

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.020 
aspect I think the first stage
especially<00:05:10.229> if<00:05:10.770> it's<00:05:11.040> like<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.490> mutual<00:05:11.700> hang

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
especially if it's like a mutual hang

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.870 
especially if it's like a mutual hang
out<00:05:12.180> then<00:05:12.419> split<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.710> disagree<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.640> right

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
out then split it you disagree the right

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.190 
out then split it you disagree the right
ship<00:05:15.090> oh<00:05:15.210> he's<00:05:15.419> not<00:05:15.600> yet<00:05:15.810> at<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.110> beginning

then he should pay he should but not to
say<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.700> girl<00:05:44.850> then<00:05:45.060> if<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.270> go<00:05:45.390> get

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570

and then if she plans the next day I

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.240 
and then if she plans the next day I
think<00:05:48.270> she<00:05:48.570> should<00:05:48.600> pay<00:05:48.870> but<00:05:49.050> then<00:05:49.290> in<00:05:50.010> the

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
think she should pay but then in the

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.400 
think she should pay but then in the
relationship<00:05:50.850> if<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.390> think<00:05:51.720> whoever<00:05:52.020> is

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
relationship if I think whoever is

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.590

making more of the money and in relation

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.880 
making more of the money and in relation
sort<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.810> thinking<00:05:55.020> it<00:05:55.140> could<00:05:55.290> go<00:05:55.410> up<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:55.710> down

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
sort of thinking it could go up and down

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.430 
sort of thinking it could go up and down
then<00:05:56.640> then<00:05:57.210> if<00:05:57.360> I'm<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.900> female<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.350> I'm

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
then then if I'm the female and I'm

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.520 
then then if I'm the female and I'm
making<00:05:58.740> more<00:05:58.830> money<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.160> have<00:05:59.400> no<00:05:59.460> problem

that comes with being a relationship and

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.400 
that comes with being a relationship and
you've<00:06:21.820> had<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.090> conversation<00:06:22.720> of<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.320> know

expect<00:06:24.760> a<00:06:25.000> man<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.180> pay<00:06:25.390> for<00:06:25.570> everything<00:06:25.780> and

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
expect a man to pay for everything and

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.840 
expect a man to pay for everything and
pay<00:06:26.200> my<00:06:26.350> rent<00:06:26.530> if<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:26.830> weren't<00:06:26.950> married<00:06:27.190> and

I'm<00:06:27.970> constantly<00:06:28.570> and<00:06:28.750> I<00:06:28.810> think<00:06:28.990> that's<00:06:29.140> where

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
I'm constantly and I think that's where

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.200 
I'm constantly and I think that's where
there's<00:06:29.890> like<00:06:30.250> this<00:06:30.460> gray<00:06:30.700> area<00:06:30.730> because

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
there's like this gray area because

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.180 
there's like this gray area because
women<00:06:31.450> want<00:06:31.570> to<00:06:31.720> be<00:06:31.870> independent<00:06:32.500> so<00:06:32.980> then<00:06:33.100> the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
women want to be independent so then the

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.980 
women want to be independent so then the
man<00:06:33.340> goes<00:06:33.580> awesome<00:06:34.060> then<00:06:34.390> you're<00:06:34.540> independent

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
man goes awesome then you're independent

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.060 
man goes awesome then you're independent
then<00:06:35.080> we'll<00:06:35.260> split<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:35.740> then<00:06:35.830> the<00:06:35.920> girl

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
then we'll split it and then the girl
