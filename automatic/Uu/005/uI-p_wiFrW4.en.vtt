00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.560 
to jump into this crack and if you /
jump<00:02:21.130> then<00:02:21.610> you're<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.239> ever<00:02:22.330> get

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
jump then you're not going to ever get

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.750 
jump then you're not going to ever get
it<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:23.260> more<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> an<00:02:23.800> expert<00:02:24.340> level<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:27.580> are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
it it's more of an expert level we are

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.010 
it it's more of an expert level we are
founders<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.660> glitch<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:31.450> next<00:02:31.750> week

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
founders of this glitch it's next week

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.150 
founders of this glitch it's next week
we<00:02:32.200> found<00:02:32.410> by<00:02:32.709> ourselves<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.230> found<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
we found by ourselves but we found the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.420 
we found by ourselves but we found the
other<00:02:36.310> glitch<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.120> one<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.540> our<00:02:37.660> friends<00:02:38.170> I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
other glitch for one of our friends I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180 
other glitch for one of our friends I
don't<00:02:39.430> know<00:02:39.520> how<00:02:39.670> he<00:02:39.730> found<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.209> but<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.890> we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
don't know how he found it but so we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.310 
don't know how he found it but so we
just<00:02:42.430> figured<00:02:42.940> heck<00:02:43.120> there's<00:02:43.330> another<00:02:43.540> crack

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
just figured heck there's another crack

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.760 
just figured heck there's another crack
in<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.560> wall<00:02:44.680> let's<00:02:44.920> try<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:46.690> did<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.260> we

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
in the wall let's try it we did and we

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.710 
in the wall let's try it we did and we
landed<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> protective

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
landed in it and it put a protective

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
landed in it and it put a protective
barrier<00:02:50.019> around<00:02:50.260> us<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.630> just

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
barrier around us so you know just

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.040 
barrier around us so you know just
figured<00:02:57.580> what<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.730> heck

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.150 

see<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.230> go<00:03:05.740> into<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.070> barrier<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.760> lot<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:08.380> is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
see you go into that barrier a lot it is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:21.430 
see you go into that barrier a lot it is
a<00:03:09.190> very<00:03:09.390> hard<00:03:10.390> glitch

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.190 

same<00:03:22.070> thing<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.520> me<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.020> can

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
same thing on me if you can but we can

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.460 
same thing on me if you can but we can
get<00:03:24.320> our<00:03:24.410> religious

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470

better if you have room ok we're going
to<00:03:38.709> skip<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.129> glitch<00:03:39.489> since<00:03:39.849> we<00:03:40.000> can't<00:03:40.239> seem

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
to skip that glitch since we can't seem

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.600 
to skip that glitch since we can't seem
to<00:03:40.450> get<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.810> right<00:03:40.930> now<00:03:41.200> let's<00:03:41.980> go<00:03:42.190> choke<00:03:42.400> left

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
to get it right now let's go choke left

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.770 
to get it right now let's go choke left
run<00:03:43.120> jump<00:03:45.300> lay<00:03:46.300> down<00:03:48.120> it'll<00:03:49.120> be<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.300> protective

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
run jump lay down it'll be a protective

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.600 
run jump lay down it'll be a protective

that glitch and what you try it at home

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.410 
that glitch and what you try it at home
by<00:03:56.920> yourself<00:03:59.670> try<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> jump<00:04:01.030> right<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.360> the
