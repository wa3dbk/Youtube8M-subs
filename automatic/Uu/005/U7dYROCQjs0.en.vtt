you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.350 

Oh

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.810 

yeah<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.110> idea<00:00:21.440> of<00:00:21.590> zigtech<00:00:21.830> is<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.400> kind<00:00:22.730> of

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
yeah the idea of zigtech is to kind of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.850 
yeah the idea of zigtech is to kind of
fuse<00:00:23.180> energy<00:00:23.750> return<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.290> cushioning<00:00:24.710> and

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
fuse energy return and cushioning and

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.670 
fuse energy return and cushioning and
one<00:00:25.070> shoe<00:00:25.370> so<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:26.600> cushioning<00:00:27.020> platform

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
one shoe so the the cushioning platform

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.410 
one shoe so the the cushioning platform
very<00:00:27.950> distinctive<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.550> look<00:00:28.700> at<00:00:28.880> obviously

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
very distinctive to look at obviously

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.870 
very distinctive to look at obviously
but<00:00:29.600> design<00:00:30.260> that<00:00:30.440> way<00:00:30.590> for<00:00:30.830> a<00:00:30.860> reason<00:00:30.950> so<00:00:31.730> we

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
but design that way for a reason so we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.090 
but design that way for a reason so we
took<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.150> influence<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:33.170> slinky<00:00:33.680> if<00:00:33.950> you

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
took the influence of a slinky if you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.740 
took the influence of a slinky if you
will<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.030> idea<00:00:35.330> of<00:00:35.450> all<00:00:35.570> these

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
will in the idea of all these

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.690 
will in the idea of all these
individuals<00:00:36.320> zigs<00:00:36.620> is<00:00:36.920> they<00:00:37.190> bounce<00:00:37.460> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
individuals zigs is they bounce the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.850 
individuals zigs is they bounce the
energy<00:00:38.059> return<00:00:38.360> back<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.140> what<00:00:39.500> energy

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
energy return back to you so what energy

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.799 
energy return back to you so what energy
you<00:00:39.980> land<00:00:40.280> with<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.580> he'll<00:00:40.760> strike<00:00:41.030> comes<00:00:41.570> back

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
you land with it he'll strike comes back

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.450 
you land with it he'll strike comes back
to<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.050> with<00:00:42.170> two<00:00:42.320> off<00:00:42.500> they're<00:00:43.370> really

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
to you with two off they're really

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.490 
to you with two off they're really
comfortable<00:00:43.820> weather<00:00:44.300> really<00:00:44.600> lightly<00:00:44.900> going

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
comfortable weather really lightly going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.110 
comfortable weather really lightly going
to<00:00:45.590> barely<00:00:46.040> even<00:00:46.160> notice<00:00:46.700> that<00:00:46.730> they're<00:00:46.970> on

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
to barely even notice that they're on

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.910 
to barely even notice that they're on
they<00:00:47.780> look<00:00:47.930> kind<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:48.290> they<00:00:48.440> look<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:48.770> much

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
they look kind of they look so much

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.350 
they look kind of they look so much
different<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.820> kind<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.059> look<00:00:50.180> at<00:00:50.270> them

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
different and you kind of look at them

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.700 
different and you kind of look at them
to<00:00:50.420> think<00:00:50.540> odd<00:00:50.809> they're<00:00:51.320> really<00:00:51.500> different

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
to think odd they're really different

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.920 
to think odd they're really different
but<00:00:52.040> they<00:00:52.250> feel<00:00:52.520> I<00:00:52.910> feel<00:00:53.090> great<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.630> run<00:00:53.810> it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
but they feel I feel great to run it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.470 
but they feel I feel great to run it
kind<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.380> put<00:00:54.530> an<00:00:54.620> extra<00:00:54.829> spring<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.220> your<00:00:55.340> step

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
kind of put an extra spring in your step

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.020 
kind of put an extra spring in your step
when<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:56.630> running<00:00:57.489> zigtech<00:00:58.489> was<00:00:58.730> actually

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
when you're running zigtech was actually

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030 
when you're running zigtech was actually
inspired<00:00:59.120> by<00:00:59.480> some<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.380> energy<00:01:00.739> transfer

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
inspired by some the energy transfer

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.010 
inspired by some the energy transfer
found<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.820> slinky<00:01:02.180> has<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.300> few<00:01:02.630> strapping

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
found in the slinky has a few strapping

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.350 
found in the slinky has a few strapping
for<00:01:03.230> actually<00:01:03.980> inspired<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.580> geometric

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
for actually inspired the geometric

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.730 
for actually inspired the geometric

course behind us it was really good fun
you<00:01:26.090> know<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.570> think<00:01:26.780> every<00:01:27.140> every

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you know and I think every every

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.380 
you know and I think every every
individual<00:01:28.010> or<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.580> journalists<00:01:29.060> they<00:01:29.180> all

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
individual or the journalists they all

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.240 
individual or the journalists they all
had<00:01:29.540> an<00:01:29.660> incredible<00:01:30.050> time<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.980> very

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
had an incredible time the very

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.590 
had an incredible time the very
competitive<00:01:31.730> I<00:01:31.820> don't<00:01:32.000> think<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.300> don't

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
competitive I don't think that I don't

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.090 
competitive I don't think that I don't
expect<00:01:32.900> them<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.110> be<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.350> competitive<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:33.980> it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
expect them to be so competitive but it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.780 
expect them to be so competitive but it
was<00:01:34.250> really<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.610> great<00:01:35.060> team<00:01:35.330> effort<00:01:35.800> good<00:01:36.800> we

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
I've been an awesome fan since I was

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.680 
I've been an awesome fan since I was
like<00:01:56.930> five<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.470> I'm<00:01:58.280> much<00:01:59.000> quite<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.330> few<00:01:59.540> game

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
like five so I'm much quite a few game

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.420 
like five so I'm much quite a few game
i'm<00:01:59.750> sitting<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.170> last<00:02:00.380> last<00:02:00.800> year<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:01.280> two
