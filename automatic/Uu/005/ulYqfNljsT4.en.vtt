rather<00:01:44.700> different<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.450> its<00:01:45.600> own<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.259> for

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
rather different in its own way for

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.219 
rather different in its own way for
instance<00:01:47.100> me<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:48.090> breaking<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.630> how

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
instance me you just breaking down how

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.740 
instance me you just breaking down how
like<00:01:49.500> cotton<00:01:49.950> candy<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.579> overpriced<00:01:51.210> as

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
like cotton candy is overpriced as

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
like cotton candy is overpriced as
and<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.320> should<00:01:52.439> only<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.680> 200<00:01:53.130> yen<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.549> for

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and it should only be 200 yen but for

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.639 
and it should only be 200 yen but for
some<00:01:53.909> reason<00:01:54.329> you're<00:01:54.720> paying<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> for

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
some reason you're paying for it for

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
some reason you're paying for it for
even<00:01:55.920> more<00:01:56.100> money<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> funny

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
even more money but it's kind of funny

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.969 
even more money but it's kind of funny
if<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.469> because

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
if you think about it like that because

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
if you think about it like that because
it<00:01:59.579> shouldn't<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.840> money

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it shouldn't really be that much money

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
it shouldn't really be that much money
if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.530> about<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> pricing<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
if you think about the pricing if you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
if you think about the pricing if you
were<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> yourself<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.719> let's<00:02:03.899> get

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
were to make it yourself but let's get

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.389 
were to make it yourself but let's get
back<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> real<00:02:04.500> discussion<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.250> me

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
back to the real discussion of what me
you<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.640> trying<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.240> why<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.540> can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you was trying to go with that why i can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
you was trying to go with that why i can
actually<00:02:07.170> talk<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.890> mean<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
actually talk about that mean you got to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.720 
actually talk about that mean you got to
realize<00:02:09.170> even<00:02:10.170> though<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.709> overpriced<00:02:11.370> and

realize even though it is overpriced and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.320 
realize even though it is overpriced and
that's<00:02:11.879> kind<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.209> how<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> world<00:02:12.750> works

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

minutes just go by go by myself for a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.880 
minutes just go by go by myself for a
little<00:02:26.060> bit<00:02:26.300> extra<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.660> mean<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.290> gotta<00:02:27.500> also

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
little bit extra I mean you gotta also

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.979 
little bit extra I mean you gotta also
factor<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> man<00:02:28.730> power<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.810> people

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.509 
factor in the man power of the people
making<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.280> themselves

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
making it if they make it themselves

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.089 
making it if they make it themselves
with<00:02:32.030> their<00:02:32.120> equipment<00:02:32.540> stuff<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.989> might<00:02:33.769> also

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
with their equipment stuff it might also

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.680 
with their equipment stuff it might also
factored<00:02:34.700> into<00:02:34.880> why<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> little<00:02:35.510> bit<00:02:35.599> more

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
factored into why it's a little bit more

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.080 
factored into why it's a little bit more
price<00:02:35.870> because<00:02:36.140> you're<00:02:36.349> doing<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.160> lazy<00:02:37.819> way

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
price because you're doing the lazy way

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.270 
price because you're doing the lazy way
you're<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.360> really<00:02:38.569> making<00:02:38.810> yourself<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.860> in

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
you're not really making yourself so in

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.640 
you're not really making yourself so in
terms<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.910> being<00:02:41.180> overpriced<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.230> would<00:02:42.440> say

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
terms of being overpriced I would say

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.250 
terms of being overpriced I would say
it's<00:02:42.920> fine<00:02:43.250> i<00:02:43.519> do<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:44.300> still<00:02:44.810> funny<00:02:45.080> how

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's fine i do but it's still funny how

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.539 
it's fine i do but it's still funny how

entertaining<00:02:48.920> part<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.850> episode<00:02:50.360> but

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
entertaining part about this episode but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.460 
entertaining part about this episode but
besides<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.590> episode<00:02:51.980> was<00:02:52.130> kind<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:53.470> its

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
besides that the episode was kind of its

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
season I think we are like this is this

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.229 
season I think we are like this is this
episode<00:03:02.660> five<00:03:02.890> or<00:03:03.890> six<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:04.970> those<00:03:05.030> it

episode five or six it's one of those it

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.640 
episode five or six it's one of those it
might<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.510> four<00:03:05.720> five<00:03:05.900> or<00:03:05.959> six<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:06.590> of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
might be four five or six it's one of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.289 
might be four five or six it's one of
those<00:03:06.769> episodes<00:03:07.069> but<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:08.030> still<00:03:08.239> pretty

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
those episodes but it's still pretty

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.089 
those episodes but it's still pretty
damn<00:03:08.750> for<00:03:09.019> me<00:03:09.200> we're<00:03:09.319> already<00:03:09.470> halfway<00:03:09.769> done
