00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.650

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 with these video tutorials I simply want to 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.839
 to show gods 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.099

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.270
 I don't want to teach you what the manipulation is the path 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.140
 hard 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.560

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.880
 rambo said this world to launch success to how many people we make one 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.810
 list on me. in a businessman 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.010
 then then naturally resume a deck of cards 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.790
 and where the kings are removed from the pack of cards 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.820
 the aces 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.650
 humbly they are 4 each 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.530
