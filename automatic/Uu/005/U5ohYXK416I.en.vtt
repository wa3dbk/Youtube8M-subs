and so now we can take that off of it
drop<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.240> needle<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:02.620> now<00:01:03.540> we<00:01:04.540> purl<00:01:04.870> into

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
drop the needle then now we purl into

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.750 
drop the needle then now we purl into
three<00:01:05.890> stitches<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.560> we've<00:01:08.770> got<00:01:09.010> three<00:01:09.580> on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
three stitches so we've got three on

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.790 
three stitches so we've got three on
there<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.420> let's<00:01:16.750> hear<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:17.080> looks<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.560> yet

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800

there so let's hear that looks like yet
so<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:21.000> knit<00:01:40.140> purl<00:01:41.140> three<00:01:41.770> together<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:44.520> now

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
so we knit purl three together and now

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.380 
so we knit purl three together and now
that's<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.880> end<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.149> my<00:01:46.390> row<00:01:47.910> do<00:01:48.910> my<00:01:49.149> edge

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
that's the end of my row do my edge

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.710 
that's the end of my row do my edge
stitches

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.620 

then<00:01:54.320> return<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.410> quite<00:01:58.630> simple

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
then return this is quite simple

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.310 
then return this is quite simple
instructions<00:02:01.510> do<00:02:02.510> edge<00:02:02.780> stitches<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.770> then

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
instructions do edge stitches and then

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.430 
instructions do edge stitches and then
you<00:02:06.320> simply<00:02:06.590> purl<00:02:07.100> across

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.230 

be<00:02:15.040> careful<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.760> easy<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
be careful it can be easy to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.930 
be careful it can be easy to
accidentally<00:02:17.110> grab<00:02:18.000> two<00:02:20.460> stitches<00:02:21.460> at<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> time

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
accidentally grab two stitches at a time

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.730 
accidentally grab two stitches at a time

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:34.010 

much

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.790 

and<00:03:34.350> if<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.070> look<00:03:35.280> once<00:03:35.550> you've<00:03:35.760> done<00:03:36.800> even

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
and if you look once you've done even

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.870 
and if you look once you've done even
just<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:39.650> row<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:43.110> first<00:03:43.140> row<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.980> will

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
just a row the first row and you will

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.310 
just a row the first row and you will
for<00:03:45.120> some<00:03:45.150> second<00:03:45.450> row<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.330> look<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:49.140> the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
for some second row you can look at the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.840 
for some second row you can look at the
stitches<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:49.950> kind<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.430> how<00:03:50.640> they're

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
stitches and kind of see how they're

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.310 
stitches and kind of see how they're
grouped<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.530> when<00:03:52.710> you<00:03:52.860> see<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:54.690> grouping

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
grouped so when you see this grouping

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.790 
grouped so when you see this grouping
that's<00:03:55.590> three<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.700> one<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:59.280> know<00:03:59.460> that<00:04:00.800> you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
that's three and one you know that you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:12.400 
that's three and one you know that you
want<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.070> make<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.640> three<00:04:05.510> three<00:04:07.280> into<00:04:08.280> one

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.580 

and<00:04:13.410> then

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:29.370 

the<00:04:18.130> one<00:04:20.700> into<00:04:24.180> three<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.620> now<00:04:26.830> we<00:04:26.889> have<00:04:28.380> edge

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
the one into three and now we have edge

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.050 
the one into three and now we have edge
stitches

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.590 

now<00:04:37.000> Row<00:04:38.000> 4<00:04:38.420> is<00:04:38.780> again<00:04:39.050> our<00:04:39.380> nice<00:04:39.560> simple<00:04:40.600> purl

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
now Row 4 is again our nice simple purl

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.650 
now Row 4 is again our nice simple purl
across<00:04:42.730> except<00:04:43.730> for<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> extra<00:04:44.120> stitches<00:04:44.480> -
