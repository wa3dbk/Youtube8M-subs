household and not so household items
that's<00:00:15.509> right

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
that's right

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
that's right
this<00:00:16.109> one's<00:00:16.320> pretty<00:00:16.710> easy<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.400> household<00:00:17.850> e

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this one's pretty easy to do household e

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
this one's pretty easy to do household e
so<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.510> show<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.690> how<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> make<00:00:19.109> some

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
so we're gonna show you how to make some

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
so we're gonna show you how to make some
snowflake<00:00:20.279> ornaments<00:00:21.029> they're<00:00:21.210> really

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
snowflake ornaments they're really

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.630 
snowflake ornaments they're really
awesome<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.070> similar<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.519> you've

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
awesome this is really similar if you've

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
awesome this is really similar if you've
ever<00:00:23.789> made<00:00:23.939> rock<00:00:24.210> candy<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:25.560> very<00:00:26.039> similar

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
ever made rock candy very very similar

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
ever made rock candy very very similar
it's<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.930> yes<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> same

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it's just like that yes not the same

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's just like that yes not the same
thing<00:00:28.949> no<00:00:29.250> we're<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:29.609> making

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
thing no we're actually making

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.580 
thing no we're actually making
crystallized<00:00:31.460> snowflakes<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> things<00:00:34.500> are

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
crystallized snowflakes so things are

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.510 
crystallized snowflakes so things are
gonna<00:00:34.710> need<00:00:34.950> pipe<00:00:35.820> cleaners<00:00:37.219> optional<00:00:38.219> food

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
gonna need pipe cleaners optional food

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.470 
gonna need pipe cleaners optional food
coloring<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.840> borax<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.739> big<00:00:41.219> jar<00:00:41.579> some

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
coloring some borax a big jar some
boiling<00:00:42.690> water<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:44.190> twine<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.910> we're

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
boiling water and some twine so we're

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
boiling water and some twine so we're
gonna<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> red<00:00:45.750> snowflake<00:00:46.649> start<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
gonna make a red snowflake start with a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
gonna make a red snowflake start with a
couple<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> pipe<00:00:48.120> cleaners<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> flip

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
couple of pipe cleaners you want to flip

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
couple of pipe cleaners you want to flip
it<00:00:50.190> into<00:00:50.399> three<00:00:50.579> pieces<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.149> yeah<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> then

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it into three pieces right yeah and then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.400 
it into three pieces right yeah and then
basically<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.079> doing<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
basically what we're gonna be doing is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
basically what we're gonna be doing is
twisting<00:00:55.949> each<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.430> pieces<00:00:57.109> around

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
twisting each of these pieces around

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.810 
twisting each of these pieces around
each<00:00:59.039> other<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:02.030> yeah<00:01:04.159> man<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.369> doing<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
each other so yeah man you're doing it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.929 
each other so yeah man you're doing it
so<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.810> make<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> snowflake<00:01:08.010> oh<00:01:08.460> yeah<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so I make it a snowflake oh yeah it's a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.920 
so I make it a snowflake oh yeah it's a
new<00:01:15.150> ABC<00:01:15.720> special<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.130> no<00:01:17.340> play

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
new ABC special is that it's no play

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.730 
new ABC special is that it's no play
sound<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.170> after<00:01:19.439> Rudolph's<00:01:19.920> enough<00:01:21.740> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
sound right after Rudolph's enough so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.550 
sound right after Rudolph's enough so
basically<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.450> create<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
basically what we want to do is create a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
basically what we want to do is create a
mixture<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.520> borax<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.240> some<00:01:27.540> boiling

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
mixture of the borax and some boiling

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
mixture of the borax and some boiling
water<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.259> hang<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> thingy

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
water to hang this thingy

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
water to hang this thingy
so<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.970> grab<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so I will grab that and if you want to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
so I will grab that and if you want to
tie<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.680> yep<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.880> while<00:01:33.000> Lacey's<00:01:33.329> doing

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
tie this up yep so while Lacey's doing

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
tie this up yep so while Lacey's doing
that<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> create<00:01:34.500> something<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that I'm going to create something to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
that I'm going to create something to
hang<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> over<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.000> gonna<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
hang this over what we're gonna do is we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
hang this over what we're gonna do is we
want<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> hang<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.130> touch<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.790> jar

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
want this to hang and not touch the jar

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.929 
want this to hang and not touch the jar
so<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> chemicals<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so it can be in the chemicals and the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.569 
so it can be in the chemicals and the
chemicals<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.659> sort<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> attach<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.159> grow

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
chemicals can sort of attach to and grow

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.560 
chemicals can sort of attach to and grow
on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.299> snowflake<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> mega<00:01:47.970> mega

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on the snowflake so we have a mega mega

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
on the snowflake so we have a mega mega
sized<00:01:48.990> mason<00:01:49.590> jar<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.430> I've<00:01:50.520> ever

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
sized mason jar I don't think I've ever

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
sized mason jar I don't think I've ever
seen<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> mason<00:01:51.270> jar<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.570> big<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:51.990> life<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
seen a mason jar this big in my life so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.899 
seen a mason jar this big in my life so
what<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> want<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> make

what you want to do is you want to make
sure<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> snowflake<00:01:54.720> goes<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.460> doesn't

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
sure that the snowflake goes in doesn't

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330 
sure that the snowflake goes in doesn't
touch<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> sides<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> bottom<00:01:58.340> looking

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
touch the sides or the bottom looking

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.230 
touch the sides or the bottom looking
good<00:01:59.490> yeah<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> looks<00:01:59.969> great

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
so we want to put the borax in there

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
so we want to put the borax in there
first<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.369> measurement<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.090> three

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
first the measurement is three

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
first the measurement is three
tablespoons<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:04.350> borax<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.159> every<00:02:05.520> cup<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
tablespoons of borax to every cup of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.250 
tablespoons of borax to every cup of
water<00:02:06.049> so

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.760 

we're<00:02:10.260> just<00:02:10.500> gonna<00:02:10.680> put<00:02:11.010> some<00:02:12.320> giant<00:02:13.320> mason

we're just gonna put some giant mason

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
we're just gonna put some giant mason
jars<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> world's<00:02:15.930> largest

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
jars and then get the world's largest

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.750 
jars and then get the world's largest
spoon<00:02:16.770> there<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.280> go

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
spoon there we go

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.890 
spoon there we go
so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.090> want<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.300> stir<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.510> around<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
so you want to stir this around in the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
so you want to stir this around in the
boiling<00:02:19.050> water<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.530> want<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.740> borax<00:02:20.100> to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
boiling water and you want the borax to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.550 
boiling water and you want the borax to
dissolve<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.690> use<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> do<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.260> laundry

in<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.300> yeah<00:02:27.780> let's<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.620> once<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.070> do

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
in this yeah let's do it so once we do

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650 
in this yeah let's do it so once we do
red<00:02:29.880> red

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
red red

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.140 
red red
all<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.490> would<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.670> cool<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.060> we'll

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
all right so this would be cool so we'll

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390 
all right so this would be cool so we'll
be<00:02:36.560> theoretically<00:02:37.560> growing<00:02:37.950> some<00:02:38.160> red

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
be theoretically growing some red

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.450 
be theoretically growing some red
crystals<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.530> red<00:02:40.680> pipe<00:02:40.950> right<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
crystals on the red pipe right on the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.390 
crystals on the red pipe right on the
red<00:02:41.610> pipe<00:02:41.880> line<00:02:42.260> yeah<00:02:43.580> especially<00:02:45.830> Merce<00:02:46.860> oh

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
red pipe line yeah especially Merce oh

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.890 
red pipe line yeah especially Merce oh
we<00:02:47.580> need<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> tie<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.360> thing<00:02:48.600> that's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
we need to tie it to this thing that's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.420 
we need to tie it to this thing that's
yeah<00:02:49.170> let's<00:02:49.410> dunk<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:51.080> come<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.200> man

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
we're using another pipe cleaner you can

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
green food coloring you can barely

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.380 
green food coloring you can barely
barely<00:03:37.440> tell<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> difference<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:39.180> one
