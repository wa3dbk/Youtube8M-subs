00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.360
 the girl of hans matches 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.360
 christian andersen 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.099
 how cold it was snowing and starting to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.980
 darkening was the last night of the year the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.199
 wild night under that cold and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 in that darkness I passed by the street 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.540
 a poor girl, barefoot and with her head 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.149
 discovered truth is that when you leave your 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.640
 house was wearing shoes but that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.070
 they served were slippers that his 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 mother had recently worn the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 small came to him so big that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 he lost while running across the street to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 get rid of two cars that came to all 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.380
 speed one of the shoes there was no 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
 one means of finding it and the other one is 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.160
 had put a lad who said that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 I would make her serve as a cradle on the day 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 I had children and so the poor chair 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 she was barefoot with the nudes 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.090
 little fish completely bruised by 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 the cold in an old apron was wearing a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 handful of matches and a packet in a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 hand all day no one 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.969
 he had bought nothing or given him a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 miserable shilling he was returning to his house 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.340
 hungry in half frost and it looked so 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 dejected the poor thing the snowflakes 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.090
 they fell on his long blond hair 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.570
 the beautiful curls covered their necks 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.940
 but she was not to show off in a 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.890
 angle that formed two houses one more 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.890
 outgoing that the other sat on the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.810
 floor and curled into a ball in 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.600
 what to the little feet as much as possible 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.000
 but the cold was invading her and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.220
 another part did not dare to go home 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.830
 he had not sold a match and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.229
 they picked up a sad penny his father 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.560
 I would add that it was cold at home 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.570
 they were also only covered by the roof and the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.130
 wind came everywhere despite 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.340
 the straw and the rags with which 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.940
 tried to cover the slits had the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 handymen almost frozen with cold there is a 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.520
 phosphorus would surely relieve her if she 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 You dare to take only one bunch 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.610
 rub it against the wall and warm up 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.940
 fingers and pulled out a rich like sparkle 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.280
 as they burned he gave a warm clear flame 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.950
 like a little light when I remember it with 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.319
 the hand a wonderful light 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.940
 it seemed to the little ela who was 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.670
 sitting next to a big scam of 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.319
 iron with feet and brass bell the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.560
 fire burned magnificently in his 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.450
 inside and also warmed the girl 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.209
 He extended his feet to warm them to his 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.790
 time but the flame went out added 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.360
 the stove and she was sitting with the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.099
 rest of the consumed match in hand 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.170
 ignited another that will burn and project 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.900
 his light on the wall came back to this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.430
 transparent as if it were gauze and the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 girl could see the inside of a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.720
 room where the table was set 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.510
 covered with a very white tablecloth and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 fine porcelain a roasted duck a bean 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.579
 deliciously stuffed with plums and 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.709
 apples and the best part of the case was that the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.660
 Duck jumped out of the fountain and 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.640
 adding on the ground with a fork and 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.040
 a knife behind his back went 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.200
 towards the poor little girl but in that one 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 moment the phosphorus was extinguished leaving 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.760
 visible only the thick and cold wall 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.200
 the girl lit a third match and 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.959
 she found herself sitting under a 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.640
 beautiful Christmas tree was one more 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.800
 tall and prettier than the one who saw the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.540
 last poinsettia through the door 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.480
 of crystals in the house of the rich 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.880
 merchant thousands of candles burned 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.310
 in the green branches and from these they hung 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 painted pictures similar to those 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.440
 the shop windows adorned 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.140
 he raised both arms and then he 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.420
 put out the match all the little lights 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.590
 they went up high and she gave 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.170
 account that they were the glittering ones 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.540
 stars of the sky one of them will 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.420
 detached and drew in the sky a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.690
 long trail of fire someone is 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.459
 dying thought the girl because her grandmother the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.400
 only person who had loved her but 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.440
 that she was dead she had already told him 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.890
 When a star falls a soul rises 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.050
 towards god 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.870
 soon a new match against the wall 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.360
 the immediate space was illuminated and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.540
 the old radiant granny appeared 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.480
 sweet and loving granny this year the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.700
 small take me with you I know you will go 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.290
 also when the phosphorus of the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.380
 same way that the stove went on 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.090
 roasted and the Christmas tree hurried 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.850
 to light the floors that were left 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.800
 eager not to lose her grandmother and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.470
 Two golds shined with clearer light than 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.169
 the one of the day never the grandmother had 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.180
 been so tall and so beautiful took the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.340
 girl in the arm and wrapped both in 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.410
 a great glow enchiladas of joy 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.870
 they started the flight to the heights 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.320
 without the child feeling cold 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.180
 hungry nor scared were in the mansion of 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.759
 God our lord 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.160
 but in the corner of the house the cold 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.979
 early morning discovered the little girl red 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.440
 cheeks and mouth smiling dead 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.199
 dying of cold on the last night of 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.110
 year old the first morning of the year 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.539
 new lit the little corpse sitting 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.110
 with their matches a little packet of 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.870
 which appeared consumed almost entirely 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.370
 He wanted to warm up, said the people but 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.560
 nobody knew the wonders that had 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.960
 seen nor the glow with that in 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.580
 company with his elderly grandmother had 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.150
 climbed to the glory of the new year 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.150
 finish
