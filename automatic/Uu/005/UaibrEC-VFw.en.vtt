surprising<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:14.040> let's<00:00:14.219> say<00:00:14.400> open<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
surprising so let's say open this up and

pounds three for the place or two which
is<00:00:30.840> good<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.850> like

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
is good as well but this is just like

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.569 
is good as well but this is just like
ridiculous<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.250> do

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
ridiculous that they can actually do

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.380 
ridiculous that they can actually do
this<00:00:35.870> okay<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.430> using<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> typical

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this okay so it's using the typical

this okay so it's using the typical

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
little chalk that steps the voltage up

little chalk that steps the voltage up
the<00:01:11.220> LED<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> 1.2<00:01:12.659> volts<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> cell

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the LED from the 1.2 volts of the cell

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.880 
the LED from the 1.2 volts of the cell
and<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.070> on/off<00:01:14.430> switch<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.290> as<00:01:16.290> always<00:01:16.619> it's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and the on/off switch and as always it's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910 
and the on/off switch and as always it's
a<00:01:16.979> cold<00:01:17.250> white<00:01:17.460> LED<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.439> prefer<00:01:19.439> warm<00:01:19.740> white

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a cold white LED I prefer warm white

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
a cold white LED I prefer warm white
LEDs<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.299> shall<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.630> change<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
LEDs so I think I shall just change that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
LEDs so I think I shall just change that
right<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> warm<00:01:23.369> white<00:01:23.580> LED<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
right now for a warm white LED so the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.630 
right now for a warm white LED so the
board<00:01:27.509> has<00:01:27.600> marked<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> polarity<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> LED<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
board has marked the polarity of LED so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
board has marked the polarity of LED so
I'll<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> solder<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.009> heat

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
I'll just get the solder on and heat

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.039 
I'll just get the solder on and heat
both<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.460> pads<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.939> simultaneously<00:01:33.470> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
both those pads up simultaneously and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.530 
both those pads up simultaneously and
take<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> LED<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.670> shall<00:01:38.909> flow<00:01:39.299> some

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
take the LED out then I shall flow some

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
take the LED out then I shall flow some
fresh<00:01:39.930> solder<00:01:40.229> onto<00:01:40.439> those<00:01:40.650> pads<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
fresh solder onto those pads and then

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.289 
fresh solder onto those pads and then
use<00:01:41.640> disordering<00:01:42.150> wick<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> clean<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.780> off

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
use disordering wick to clean them off

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.740 
use disordering wick to clean them off
so<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.540> drop<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> fresh<00:01:46.320> solder<00:01:47.270> let<00:01:48.270> me<00:01:48.479> sort

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so I we drop a fresh solder let me sort

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
so I we drop a fresh solder let me sort
of<00:01:48.930> course<00:01:51.110> traditional<00:01:52.130> full<00:01:53.130> glory

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
wicks any so drop when you heat it up

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
wicks any so drop when you heat it up

you place onto solder joint heat up so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.220 
you place onto solder joint heat up so
that's<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.200> cleared

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
that's that it cleared

jolly nice so back into the housing that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.780 
jolly nice so back into the housing that
goes<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:28.230> its<00:03:28.410> dinky<00:03:28.950> little<00:03:29.070> screw<00:03:29.550> oh

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
goes with its dinky little screw oh

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.610 
goes with its dinky little screw oh
which<00:03:30.330> screws<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.810> other<00:03:31.050> all<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.380> same

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.920 

at<00:03:46.069> this<00:03:46.159> point<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.580> could<00:03:47.030> theoretically<00:03:47.629> have

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
at this point I could theoretically have

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
at this point I could theoretically have
stuck<00:03:48.260> on<00:03:48.349> my<00:03:48.530> bench<00:03:48.799> supply<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.400> given<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
stuck on my bench supply and given the

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.149 
stuck on my bench supply and given the
little<00:03:50.000> cell<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.390> booster<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.049> charge<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:51.709> but

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
little cell a booster to charge up but

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.360 
little cell a booster to charge up but
now<00:03:52.489> I'll<00:03:53.299> let<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.870> naturally<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
now I'll let it do it naturally the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.130 
now I'll let it do it naturally the
inside<00:03:55.879> is<00:03:56.060> quite<00:03:56.299> well<00:03:56.480> sealed<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.019> I'm

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
inside is quite well sealed but I'm

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.460 
inside is quite well sealed but I'm
always<00:03:57.379> there<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.780> solar<00:03:59.780> panels<00:04:00.260> themselves

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
always there the solar panels themselves

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.610 
always there the solar panels themselves
the<00:04:01.040> little<00:04:01.310> amorphous<00:04:01.910> silicon<00:04:02.330> ones<00:04:02.620> where

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
the little amorphous silicon ones where

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.990 
the little amorphous silicon ones where
there's<00:04:03.950> de<00:04:04.099> post<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.549> glass<00:04:04.760> they

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
there's de post in the glass they

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.930 
there's de post in the glass they
usually<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.660> little<00:04:06.459> motor<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:07.819> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
usually have the little motor on the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.259 
usually have the little motor on the
outside<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.420> think<00:04:08.599> these<00:04:08.780> rooms<00:04:08.989> have<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:10.269> yes

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
outside I think these rooms have it yes

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.460 
outside I think these rooms have it yes
they<00:04:11.480> do<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:13.099> stop<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.750> basically<00:04:15.290> it

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
they do to stop the it basically it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.890 
they do to stop the it basically it
seals<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.220> back<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.239> solar<00:04:17.479> panel<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
seals the back of the solar panel it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.509 
seals the back of the solar panel it
stops<00:04:18.199> eating<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.739> electrolytically<00:04:19.310> from

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
stops eating and electrolytically from

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.490 
stops eating and electrolytically from
the<00:04:19.579> edge<00:04:19.699> but<00:04:20.299> water<00:04:20.539> can<00:04:20.660> still<00:04:21.079> go<00:04:21.169> down<00:04:21.199> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the edge but water can still go down the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.110 
the edge but water can still go down the
edge<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.799> that's<00:04:21.919> usually<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.550> Sicilian

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
edge and that's usually the Sicilian

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.810 
edge and that's usually the Sicilian
wood<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.389> these<00:04:23.539> things<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.860> kind<00:04:25.699> of

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
wood of these things so I kind of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.520 
wood of these things so I kind of
recently<00:04:26.449> have<00:04:26.600> been<00:04:26.750> playing<00:04:27.050> about<00:04:27.199> with<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
recently have been playing about with a

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.250 
recently have been playing about with a
tape<00:04:27.889> that<00:04:30.789> is<00:04:31.789> designed<00:04:32.330> for<00:04:32.479> garden<00:04:33.050> use

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
tape that is designed for garden use

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.550 
tape that is designed for garden use
sort<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.070> like<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> very<00:04:34.880> dense<00:04:35.360> 3m<00:04:35.930> tape<00:04:36.260> I

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
sort of like a very dense 3m tape I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.409 
sort of like a very dense 3m tape I
don't<00:04:37.400> know<00:04:37.490> does<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.669> see<00:04:37.880> much<00:04:38.030> weightless

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
don't know does it see much weightless

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.050 
don't know does it see much weightless
it<00:04:38.570> looks<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:39.740> standard<00:04:40.070> clear<00:04:40.610> tape<00:04:40.880> but

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it looks like standard clear tape but

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.670 
it looks like standard clear tape but
it's<00:04:41.180> actually<00:04:41.449> clear<00:04:41.660> set<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:41.960> thick<00:04:42.350> plastic

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
it's actually clear set of thick plastic

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.400 
it's actually clear set of thick plastic
a<00:04:42.949> tube<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:44.150> wasn't<00:04:44.330> doing<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.900> I've

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
a tube and it wasn't doing is I've

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.430 
a tube and it wasn't doing is I've
actually<00:04:45.590> been<00:04:46.150> putting<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.270> over<00:04:47.330> some<00:04:48.320> of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
actually been putting that over some of

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.120 
actually been putting that over some of
the<00:04:48.530> blades<00:04:49.010> like<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.620> see<00:04:51.800> if<00:04:51.950> air

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
the blades like this just to see if air

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.310 
the blades like this just to see if air
that's<00:04:52.490> actually<00:04:52.970> going<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.180> help<00:04:53.270> seal<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.020> I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
that's actually going to help seal and I

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.810 
that's actually going to help seal and I
don't<00:04:54.770> know<00:04:54.830> how<00:04:54.889> long<00:04:55.099> it<00:04:55.220> will<00:04:55.280> last

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
don't know how long it will last

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.089 
don't know how long it will last
I<00:04:55.849> don't<00:04:56.210> know<00:04:56.300> if<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.630> tape<00:04:57.530> will<00:04:57.800> degrade

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
I don't know if the tape will degrade

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.920 
I don't know if the tape will degrade
under<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.610> sunlight<00:04:58.849> but<00:04:59.570> what<00:04:59.750> I've<00:04:59.810> been

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
under the sunlight but what I've been

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
under the sunlight but what I've been
doing<00:05:00.139> is<00:05:00.229> putting<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.770> and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
doing is putting it on like that and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.500 
doing is putting it on like that and
then<00:05:01.310> take<00:05:01.639> your<00:05:01.789> knife<00:05:01.940> around<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.300> edge<00:05:02.479> and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
then take your knife around the edge and

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.839 
then take your knife around the edge and
trimming<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.139> all<00:05:03.260> off<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.830> creates<00:05:04.760> a

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
trimming it all off so it creates a

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.050 
trimming it all off so it creates a
flush<00:05:05.120> surface<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.810> should<00:05:05.990> hopefully

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
flush surface and that should hopefully

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.550 
flush surface and that should hopefully
let<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.210> light<00:05:08.360> through<00:05:08.660> but<00:05:08.930> actually<00:05:09.289> block

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
let the light through but actually block

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.219 
let the light through but actually block
the<00:05:09.970> rain<00:05:10.970> from<00:05:11.270> going<00:05:11.539> into<00:05:11.810> there<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.110> don't

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
the rain from going into there I don't

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.690 
the rain from going into there I don't
know<00:05:12.410> if<00:05:12.470> I'll<00:05:12.680> make<00:05:12.710> any<00:05:13.039> difference<00:05:13.370> time

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
know if I'll make any difference time

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.050 
know if I'll make any difference time
will<00:05:13.849> tell<00:05:14.289> so<00:05:15.289> this<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:16.630> arrangement<00:05:17.630> here

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
will tell so this a arrangement here

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.270 
will tell so this a arrangement here
there's<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.120> clear<00:05:20.479> point<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.440> there<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
there's a clear point that there the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.560 
there's a clear point that there the
position<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.760> between<00:05:23.030> these<00:05:23.150> two<00:05:23.450> is

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
position in between these two is

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.810 
position in between these two is
probably<00:05:23.930> about<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.200> clearest<00:05:24.830> free<00:05:25.729> of

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
probably about the clearest free of

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.670 
probably about the clearest free of
freest<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.450> wire<00:05:26.630> for<00:05:26.990> this<00:05:27.080> battery<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.560> go

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
freest a wire for this battery to go

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.129 
freest a wire for this battery to go
south<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.130> regular<00:05:28.820> probably<00:05:29.599> go<00:05:29.690> in<00:05:29.780> like<00:05:29.960> this

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
south a regular probably go in like this

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.620 
south a regular probably go in like this
or<00:05:30.380> there<00:05:30.950> is<00:05:31.039> this<00:05:31.220> also<00:05:31.550> we<00:05:31.669> are<00:05:31.849> not<00:05:32.210> on<00:05:32.570> the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
or there is this also we are not on the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.659 
or there is this also we are not on the

casing that helps Alain it and the

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.930 
casing that helps Alain it and the
screws<00:05:38.000> go<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.510> that<00:05:38.690> should<00:05:38.960> be<00:05:39.080> ed<00:05:39.820> am<00:05:40.820> I

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
screws go in and that should be ed am I

screws go in and that should be ed am I
going<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.300> stick<00:05:41.479> this<00:05:41.599> in<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.810> garden<00:05:42.139> now

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
going to stick this in the garden now

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.140 
going to stick this in the garden now
though<00:05:42.500> is<00:05:42.650> kind<00:05:42.919> of<00:05:42.979> rather<00:05:43.220> late<00:05:43.580> it's<00:05:43.820> dark

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
though is kind of rather late it's dark

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.520 
though is kind of rather late it's dark
already<00:05:44.740> maybe<00:05:45.740> wait<00:05:45.979> for<00:05:46.280> some<00:05:47.169> delay<00:05:48.169> before

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
already maybe wait for some delay before

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.930 
already maybe wait for some delay before
I<00:05:48.560> go<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.830> start<00:05:48.979> adding<00:05:49.340> any<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.849> these

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
I go and start adding any of these

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.730 
I go and start adding any of these
lights

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
lights

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.030 
lights
oh<00:05:52.540> actually<00:05:53.540> I'm<00:05:53.840> just<00:05:53.900> thinking<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:54.680> a

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
oh actually I'm just thinking is that a

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.860 
oh actually I'm just thinking is that a
different<00:05:55.640> screen<00:05:55.910> or<00:05:56.120> it's<00:05:56.240> not<00:05:56.450> it's<00:05:56.720> not

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
different screen or it's not it's not

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:15.019 
different screen or it's not it's not
different<00:05:57.080> screw<00:05:57.380> they<00:05:57.470> are<00:05:57.590> all<00:05:57.740> identical

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.489 

and<00:06:16.029> just<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.300> finish<00:06:16.419> off<00:06:16.719> I<00:06:16.869> will<00:06:17.050> wear<00:06:17.259> go

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:17.499 
and just to finish off I will wear go

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:18.749 
and just to finish off I will wear go
around<00:06:17.710> with<00:06:17.889> a<00:06:17.919> sharp<00:06:18.460> knife

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
around with a sharp knife

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.209 
around with a sharp knife
try<00:06:19.479> not<00:06:19.629> stab<00:06:20.110> myself<00:06:20.319> in<00:06:20.559> the<00:06:20.619> process<00:06:21.069> and

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
try not stab myself in the process and

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:30.629 
try not stab myself in the process and
just<00:06:22.409> cut<00:06:23.409> that<00:06:23.559> round<00:06:23.889> like<00:06:24.069> that<00:06:29.639> not

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
just cut that round like that not

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:37.769 
just cut that round like that not
necessarily<00:06:31.209> in<00:06:31.389> a<00:06:31.449> pretty<00:06:31.689> manner<00:06:36.539> so<00:06:37.539> going

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779
