00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I have one carrying the seven points of 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.560
 the series to get in the lead of the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.559
 group 1 in the mx cup in the first 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.049
 part in this headbutt that's how it started 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.519
 I advising table set alberto 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.389
 It looked like it went to the front does not throw the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 corner 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.320
 connected with the head but his auction 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 it was going deviated necaxa reacted with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.010
 this carlos service stolen for 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.180
 ezequiel orozco that he could not define the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 hand in hand for good intervention 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.510
 of goalkeeper Miguel Angel Fraga and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 followed and the 0 by 0 match in the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.870
 first part a meeting where no 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 there were too many chances to score 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 just warnings like this shot 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.450
 also of medium long distance of 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.149
 lucas rimoldi in the first part that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.059
 diverted very attentive in the background putting together 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 navarrete if there were some warnings but 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.320
 table that managed to have more the ball in the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.239
 second part especially did not find that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
 depth here near the end of the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 first time a penalty that stops 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 point the arbitral body a hand 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 very clear within the area generated 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 morals you vote more the ball look 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.920
 badly ends up putting your hand not the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.759
 they point all 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.950
 the value but can not define the play 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.110
 and so we went to rest with the 0 x 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.490
 0 started from the second half 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.960
 InÃ©s already began to have much more 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.080
 ball began to dominate territorially 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.479
 the match especially with this vilchis 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.909
 on the left side very active and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.140
 generating good chances 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.060
 unbalancing but the few 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.770
 opportunities where n could be 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.530
 generate chance of danger 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.479
 they found with the person of arming 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 navarrete that on several occasions I 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.610
 closed with great fortune to the force 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.190
 several outside the place indicated by the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.319
 arbitral body in badly marked as in 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.840
 this occasion the service to second post 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.759
 there was not work of thrown them point 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.039
 erroneously anyway the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.140
 goalkeeper had deflected the header 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.549
 dedicate this attempt half 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.580
 distance that controlled again 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.899
 Arming navarrete in the background and good in 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.090
 the last minutes 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.310
 Endesa went further to the front began to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.649
 generate some spaces and took advantage of them 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.299
 necaxa very well especially with the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.250
 annotation that we will see in about 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.280
 more moments here precisely at the minute 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.470
 81 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.990
 and face that receives inside the area is given 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.569
 the half turn very good the move of 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.890
 this forward of the necaxa rays and 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.020
 then the definition yes with certain 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.360
 fortune there very well the at the time of 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.970
 turn around and then when doing the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.160
 contact with the ball hits him 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 with the sole of the foot with the sole 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.440
 Shoe comes out very quietly shot him but 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 enough to beat the goalkeeper 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.060
 Miguel Angel Leo Fraga and thus give him the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.520
 victory then to the rays that I eat 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.070
 I told them they take this game three 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.670
 points also take the series like this is 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.670
 that with the three
