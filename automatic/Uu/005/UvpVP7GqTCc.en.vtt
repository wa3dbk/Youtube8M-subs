00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
f-sharp minor melodic lick it's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
f-sharp minor melodic lick it's
basically<00:00:32.279> an<00:00:32.550> f-sharp<00:00:32.759> minor<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.510> then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
basically an f-sharp minor and then

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.180 
basically an f-sharp minor and then
switching<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.300> emai<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.739> tonality

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
switching into a emai and of tonality

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
switching into a emai and of tonality
though<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.840> tonality<00:00:40.170> sound<00:00:40.559> like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
though those two tonality sound like

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
though those two tonality sound like
this<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> 976<00:00:47.660> fingering

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this so it's all in the 976 fingering

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
this so it's all in the 976 fingering
pattern<00:00:49.280> except<00:00:50.280> you're<00:00:50.489> changing<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.420> your

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
pattern except you're changing up your

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
pattern except you're changing up your
you're<00:00:52.320> building<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.829> triads<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> your

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you're building of your triads and your

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.380 
you're building of your triads and your
and<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.789> seven<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.910> hear<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> mine

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and your seven so you can hear that mine

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.750 
and your seven so you can hear that mine
earnest<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> hear<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> major

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.910 

so<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> lick<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.300> basically<00:01:13.230> following<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so the lick is basically following that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
so the lick is basically following that
those<00:01:14.400> same<00:01:14.640> chords<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:16.730> doing<00:01:17.730> in<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
those same chords and doing in a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.600 
those same chords and doing in a
critical<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.440> got<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> nine<00:01:19.950> seven<00:01:20.370> six

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
critical so you got this nine seven six

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
critical so you got this nine seven six
seven<00:01:23.610> six<00:01:24.060> nine<00:01:25.730> and<00:01:26.730> then<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.510> seven<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
seven six nine and then up to seven and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.569 
seven six nine and then up to seven and
you<00:01:28.830> play<00:01:29.010> 79

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.859 

bring<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> back<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.969> to<00:01:39.090> us<00:01:39.270> 696<00:01:41.869> that's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
bring it back up to us 696 that's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
bring it back up to us 696 that's
basically<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> seven<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.880> kind<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
basically you so that seven is kind of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:56.820 
basically you so that seven is kind of
your<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.899> route<00:01:46.200> tone<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.280> lick

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.850 

and<00:01:58.900> when<00:01:59.900> that<00:02:00.050> loops<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.350> couple<00:02:00.620> times

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
and when that loops a couple times

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.940 
and when that loops a couple times
you've<00:02:01.130> got<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:07.869> another<00:02:08.869> melody<00:02:09.649> guitar

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
you've got a another melody guitar

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.010 
you've got a another melody guitar
doubling<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.369> up<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:11.360> higher<00:02:11.510> register

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
doubling that up in a higher register

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.310 
doubling that up in a higher register
and<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:13.040> basically<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.900> switching<00:02:14.900> off<00:02:15.050> of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
and it's basically a switching off of

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.930 
and it's basically a switching off of
thirds<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.010> fourths<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.060> same<00:02:17.240> keys<00:02:18.940> you

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
thirds and fourths in the same keys you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:30.220 
thirds and fourths in the same keys you
got<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.240> 67<00:02:21.080> 69<00:02:22.209> 610<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> nine<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.050> play

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
got the 67 69 610 the nine you can play

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.420 
got the 67 69 610 the nine you can play
it<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.530> two<00:02:30.560> ways<00:02:30.709> with<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> 69<00:02:31.640> 10<00:02:32.480> 9<00:02:33.430> in

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
it one of two ways with a 69 10 9 in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.080 
it one of two ways with a 69 10 9 in
that<00:02:34.640> fourth<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:37.730> play<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that fourth and we can play it on the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:03:01.090 
that fourth and we can play it on the
eleventh<00:02:38.450> fret<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.880> do<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:48.739> E<00:02:48.769> major

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.150 

that's<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.220> 777<00:03:04.160> 79

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:22.550 

and<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.340> got<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.989> 697

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.010 

that<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.640> thing<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.270> your<00:03:27.660> your

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
that kind of thing then you your your

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.260 
that kind of thing then you your your
next<00:03:28.050> part<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.370> basically<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.849> riff

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
next part of that is basically that riff

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:42.190 
next part of that is basically that riff
with<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> lot<00:03:30.720> less<00:03:30.750> notes<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:38.900> 76<00:03:40.489> 9669

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
with a lot less notes so it's a 76 9669

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.540 
with a lot less notes so it's a 76 9669
779<00:03:44.450> 677<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:46.110> you're<00:03:46.290> all<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.530> 697<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.400> didn't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
say any notes other than those so that's

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.789
