 the school do the guest professor do that 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.039

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.530
 to be honest i have no 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.120
 experience as a teacher but 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:57.230
 doug's father came to school the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:01:00.429

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 polite attention you will enter the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.730
 part of the track that is flooded 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.730
 I'm ready 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.100
 father during super work 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.860
 thanks to you julie these new tires 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 are really excellent now the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.620
 rainy days I will have a lot less 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.060
 worry to make me very well do not have to 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.690
 why do not you stop watching 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 wing mirror 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.890
 No mirrors it's a bit like 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 a third eye 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.330
 thanks to them I always know that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.910
 do the cars around us oh that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.830
 going to red accelerates dad 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.480
 it's not a good idea if it's 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.350
 goes red we're going to have a hard time 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:00.090
 stop in time she failed you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.160
 to roll over these witnesses 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.190
 the faster we go, the harder it is 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.540
 to stop when you're crossing 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.729
 never thought that all cars 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.380
 will be able to avoid you always check 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:26.640
 that they are all well stopped 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:29.720
 okay I grabbed them right tapas 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.720
 from May to August the hands tutor 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:45.940
 here is the little bird going out to listen 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 it's going to be bad weather this after 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.800
 noon according to the weather it will rain 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.730
 remember the last storm he had 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.530
 does a lot of damage 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.180
 we should go to town to make sure that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:03.250
 everything is going well you're right 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:06.190
 let's have a look we're lucky 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.780
 we just avoided the rain it's done 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.140
 good to be safe in our 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.640
 nice car says no daddy I do not know 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.590
 how do you do to see the road me 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.330
 you're right it's nightfall 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.010
 it's a time when you can see bigger 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.959
 thing and in addition this more does not help 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.860
 nothing in these conditions is difficult 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.900
 To drive 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.900
 they both fell asleep 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.500
 hop 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.500
 no 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.860
 aware 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.560
 No one is hurt 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.830
 we all go very much cars are 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.940
 our friends they render us services 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.440
 incomparable but if we do not learn 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 not good to know them 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.600
 they can become real 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.730
 monsters so what do we need to know 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.810
 on our cars 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.720
 firstly that they can not 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.330
 stop instantly and neither 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.890
 turned at full speed 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.200
 so if you see a car arrive 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.680
 you expect it to be past where 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.520
 to be stopped to cross 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.169
 secondly, when it is raining or 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.600
 snow the roads become slippery 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.880
 cars lose their grip and 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.210
 begins to slip in the rain or the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.590
 snow 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.630
 drivers have bad 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.980
 visibility then if you walk on the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.230
 sidewalk keep a safe distance 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.150
 between you and the third floor 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.250
 if you have an accident you can 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.290
 you bump or be screened in 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330
 before and really hurt you 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.130
 so the first thing to do when 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.360
 you get in the car is to put his 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:58.490
 seatbelt 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:05:00.340
 yes I could not have said it better 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.810
 car is back at home 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.700
 it looks like it is brand new is 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.990
 true but we found our car 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.770
 gsa would say a small restaurant 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.770
 Yes
