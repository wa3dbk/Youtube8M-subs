00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:09.834
 I didn't think it could happen to me. 

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:13.169
 It happened so quickly. 

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.240
 My friends can do it ... 

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.560
 ... and I met the girl. 

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.263
 We were both so drunk ... 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.650
 I should have called a taxi, but ... 

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.004
 But I didn't. 

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:26.650
 I decided to drive. 

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:29.128
 I didn't even think about it. 

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:36.157
 We just rode the highway, it was dark enough. 

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:42.981
 And then suddenly ... It was like a blink of an eye ... 

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:48.092
 We got home right. I'm driving well when I'm drunk. 

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:51.187
 However... 

00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:55.870
 When we got to me, she asked me if I was talking. 

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.866
 I didn't know what he meant. 

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:01.445
 She asked me if I ever tried heroin. 

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:06.980
 He didn't try, but I was curious. 

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.786
 Why not? Once. Only once. 

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.106
 What could be the worst? 

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:19.055
 What could be the worst? 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 So she prepared a needle ... 

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.848
 She taped my belt with my hand ... 

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:28.022
 .. and ... 

00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.308
 ... I backed out. 

00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:35.638
 Needles scare me, so I didn't want to do it. 

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:38.392
 She did, but I didn't. 

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:48.641
 And after she went down, we started to kiss. 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.304
 Things Happened and ... 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.952
 I didn't have a condom. 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.234
 I didn't think about it at all and didn't hear the moment when ... 

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:02.293
 ... so stupid, so stupid ... 

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:09.559
 And six months later I got a call. 

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.522
 It was her. 

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:16.505
 She was tested for HIV and had results. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.812
 My heart stopped. I didn't hear much of what she said. 

00:02:27.778 --> 00:02:29.400
 All I remember was .. 

00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:34.609
 Don't worry, the results came negative, you're fine. 

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:38.580
 Which I was relieved. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.872
 I was so impressed that I decided to take a vacation. 

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:52.035
 So that night I packed up and flew to Japan. 

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:59.306
 I just had to be there for a few hours 

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:01.743
 when out of nowhere ... 

00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:03.269
 ... from nowhere ... 

00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.386
 ... raped me. 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.852
 Hard. 

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:22.124
 When you become a victim of sexual violence, 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.493
 The last thing you should think about is lung cancer
