is<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.719> device<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.320> compatible<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.830> out

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
is a device that's compatible with out

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
is a device that's compatible with out
to<00:00:14.190> 99<00:00:14.639> percent<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.269> current<00:00:15.560> motorcycle

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560

actual dryer scan there we go and I'm

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120 
actual dryer scan there we go and I'm
not<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:28.049> how<00:01:28.170> well<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
not sure how well you can see but you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.210 
not sure how well you can see but you
can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.060> pretty<00:01:30.240> much<00:01:30.390> covers<00:01:31.220> my

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
can see that it pretty much covers my

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
can see that it pretty much covers my
whole<00:01:32.430> room<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> such<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
whole room like this it's got a such a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.999 
whole room like this it's got a such a
good<00:01:34.950> angle<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.720> fantastic<00:01:36.829> so<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
good angle on it fantastic so the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
good angle on it fantastic so the
instruction<00:01:38.640> manual<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> actual

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
instruction manual is on the actual

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
instruction manual is on the actual
packaging<00:01:40.890> yet<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.970> basically

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
packaging yet so you just basically

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
packaging yet so you just basically
follow<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> fitting<00:01:43.320> instructions<00:01:43.649> which

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
follow the fitting instructions which

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.510 
follow the fitting instructions which
does<00:01:44.729> seem<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.270> easy<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.770> let's<00:01:47.369> get

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
does seem pretty easy so right let's get

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.170 
does seem pretty easy so right let's get
this<00:01:47.610> fixed<00:01:47.820> onto<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> bike

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
this fixed onto the bike

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.780 
this fixed onto the bike
step1<00:01:51.260> gets<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.830> good<00:01:51.920> idea<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.430> where<00:01:52.640> you'll

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
step1 gets a good idea of where you'll

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
step1 gets a good idea of where you'll
be<00:01:52.910> placing<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> riders<00:01:53.660> can<00:01:53.870> try<00:01:54.470> moving<00:01:54.710> it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
be placing the riders can try moving it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.740 
be placing the riders can try moving it
in<00:01:55.040> different<00:01:55.250> areas<00:01:55.790> though<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.390> want<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
in different areas though you want to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.790 
in different areas though you want to
make<00:01:56.870> sure<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.110> can<00:01:57.260> still<00:01:57.470> see<00:01:57.650> the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
make sure you can still see the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.290 
make sure you can still see the
speedometer<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> position<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.180> gonna

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
speedometer in the position it's gonna

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.300 
speedometer in the position it's gonna
be<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.630> afterwards<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.770> want<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.980> clean<00:02:01.160> down

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
be in afterwards you want to clean down

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.100 
be in afterwards you want to clean down
the<00:02:01.490> windscreen<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.240> use<00:02:02.540> something<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:02.870> an

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
the windscreen so use something like an

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.050 
the windscreen so use something like an
alcohol<00:02:03.500> wipe<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:04.130> does<00:02:04.370> a<00:02:04.400> great<00:02:04.640> job<00:02:04.700> at

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
alcohol wipe which does a great job at

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.030 
alcohol wipe which does a great job at
removing<00:02:05.360> most<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.930> dirt<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.410> then<00:02:06.920> you

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
removing most of the dirt and then you

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.590 
removing most of the dirt and then you

wing mirror and he was also behind my
arm<00:03:48.079> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
arm and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.480 
arm and
he<00:03:50.570> basically<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.650> couldn't<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:52.130> him<00:03:52.220> at<00:03:52.310> all

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
he basically I couldn't see him at all

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.640 
he basically I couldn't see him at all
so<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.880> only<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.750> only<00:03:53.960> way<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:54.110> could<00:03:54.350> see<00:03:54.530> him

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
so the only the only way I could see him

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.000 
so the only the only way I could see him
was<00:03:54.860> doing<00:03:55.160> my<00:03:55.310> lifesaver<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.710> definitely

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
was doing my lifesaver so it definitely

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.490 
was doing my lifesaver so it definitely
doesn't<00:03:58.480> replace<00:03:59.480> your<00:03:59.750> lifesavers

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
doesn't replace your lifesavers

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.150 
doesn't replace your lifesavers
the<00:04:00.980> way<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.250> does<00:04:01.430> do<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.530> allows<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.830> to

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the way it does do is it allows you to

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.110 
the way it does do is it allows you to
see<00:04:04.550> things<00:04:04.790> for<00:04:05.750> instance<00:04:05.870> cyclists

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
see things for instance cyclists

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.580
