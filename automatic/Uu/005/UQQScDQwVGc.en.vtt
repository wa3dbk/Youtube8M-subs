00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.970
 knows that practical way of taking 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.430
 makeup that you have not discovered that I 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.099
 I come to tell you now the 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.900
 baby wipes to remove 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.119
 makeup people actually this here is 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.160
 but have a specific 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.710
 market but I had never tested and will 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.190
 test with you on video and if the fall 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.050
 online quota mark that I loved because 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.730
 it does not contain alcohol so it will not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.149
 damage our skin 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.370
 still on the packaging says it's the way 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.559
 general people skin cleansing energy 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.719
 daily and also in the hydration of the skin and 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.789
 nor is it logical that this one is more 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.370
 Specific if I'm not mistaken there's ninja 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.920
 People really want makeup and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.190
 Look how he removes us just in the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.019
 dodo first handkerchief he already 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.969
 had almost all makeup 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.729
 I was surprised if you are the same and 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.500
 those who have a certain laziness in the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.229
 take off the makeup 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.670
 he is soft that after you pass 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.150
 he will wash your face with 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.210
 soap and everything else but so I found 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.220
 very good this idea of taking the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.640
 wet wipe makeup because it is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.370
 very practical for you, it goes very quickly 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.610
 Do you know those who come from the party tired? 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.930
 So he's great for that, folks. 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.050
 I loved the mega ocean for you or I am 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.010
 I'm too old last I saw the way 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.020
 I did not know this trick and so 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.330
 of course you are against indication 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 please do not use because it may hurt 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.510
 your skin 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.850
 Of course we have to take a test. 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.860
 before someone was with you and I loved it 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.730
 That's what you use to get the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.800
 make up 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.010
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.150
 video review and this is it 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.150
 Kisses until the next I got lost 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 bye
