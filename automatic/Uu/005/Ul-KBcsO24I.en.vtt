think the hardest part about being an

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.239 
think the hardest part about being an
artist<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.059> judgement<00:00:55.699> self-inflicted<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
artist is judgement self-inflicted and

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.680 
artist is judgement self-inflicted and

saying hey you're not making money or

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
saying hey you're not making money or
support<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.270> extremely<00:01:07.049> important<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
support is extremely important for the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.179 
support is extremely important for the
artist

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
artist

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
artist
that's<00:01:08.850> why<00:01:09.060> artists<00:01:09.509> hang<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:09.960> other

that's why artists hang out with other

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
that's why artists hang out with other
artists<00:01:10.649> we<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.060> energy<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
artists we need to have that energy a

understand if they aren't an artist it's
hard<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> understand<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.979> internal<00:01:17.430> process

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049

20 years and hopes that maybe someday
some<00:02:29.850> will<00:02:30.000> discover<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.960> just<00:02:31.140> like

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
some will discover and it's just like

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
some will discover and it's just like
literally<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.860> gone<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.520> dust<00:02:32.730> heap<00:02:32.910> of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
literally it's gone on the dust heap of

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.430 
literally it's gone on the dust heap of
history<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.200> there<00:02:34.410> are

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
history and you know there are

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.320 
history and you know there are
successful<00:02:35.010> artists<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.940> know<00:02:36.030> didn't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
successful artists that you know didn't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
successful artists that you know didn't
even<00:02:36.420> graduate<00:02:36.810> from<00:02:36.840> college<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.040> other

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
even graduate from college so the other

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.420 
even graduate from college so the other
fallacy<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.530> know<00:02:40.650> somehow<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
fallacy is that you know somehow if you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.730 
fallacy is that you know somehow if you
haven't<00:02:41.910> had<00:02:42.480> some<00:02:42.840> sort<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.140> artistic

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
haven't had some sort of artistic

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.200 
haven't had some sort of artistic
achievement<00:02:44.310> by<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.520> time<00:02:44.820> you've<00:02:45.000> reached

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
achievement by the time you've reached

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.030 
achievement by the time you've reached
your<00:02:45.390> late<00:02:45.570> 20s<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.230> somehow<00:02:46.470> you're<00:02:46.770> done

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
your late 20s that somehow you're done

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
your late 20s that somehow you're done
you<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.820> live<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> kind<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you know we live in a kind of a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.480 
you know we live in a kind of a
wunderkind<00:02:49.050> culture<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.400> be

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
wunderkind culture I think it can be

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.790 
wunderkind culture I think it can be
easy<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> feel<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.120> way<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.050> there

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
easy to feel that way but you know there

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430 
easy to feel that way but you know there
are<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> lot<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.160> very<00:02:54.150> interesting<00:02:54.570> artists

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
are a lot of very interesting artists

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.700 
are a lot of very interesting artists
who<00:02:55.620> make<00:02:56.010> work<00:02:56.430> late<00:02:57.390> into<00:02:57.630> their<00:02:58.050> lives<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
who make work late into their lives I

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.350 
who make work late into their lives I
was<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.700> dinner<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.360> small<00:03:00.900> dinner<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.210> was

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
was at a dinner a small dinner and I was

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.240 
was at a dinner a small dinner and I was
seated<00:03:03.570> across<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.290> table<00:03:04.470> from<00:03:04.620> Dave<00:03:04.950> Hickey

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
seated across the table from Dave Hickey

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.330 
seated across the table from Dave Hickey
he<00:03:06.120> said<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.200> art<00:03:07.440> world<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.070> no

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
he said in the art world there is no

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.940 
he said in the art world there is no
such<00:03:08.640> thing<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.000> climbing<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> ladder<00:03:10.050> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
such thing as climbing the ladder you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.150 
such thing as climbing the ladder you
have<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.370> start<00:03:11.670> at<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> top<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.980> when<00:03:13.980> he

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
have to start at the top and when he

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
have to start at the top and when he
said<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.730> even<00:03:15.030> though<00:03:15.330> I'd<00:03:15.510> been<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
said that even though I'd been a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.260 
said that even though I'd been a
practicing<00:03:16.530> artist<00:03:16.950> all<00:03:17.130> those<00:03:17.310> years<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.970> hit

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
practicing artist all those years it hit

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.440 
practicing artist all those years it hit
me<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.480> had<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> brick<00:03:19.670> there<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.209> much

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
me and had like a brick there is so much

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.729 
me and had like a brick there is so much
truth<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:21.989> that

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
truth to that

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.370 
truth to that
and<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.239> that's<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> lot<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.989> young

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and I think that's what a lot of young

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.140 
and I think that's what a lot of young
artists<00:03:25.800> think<00:03:25.980> about<00:03:26.190> themselves<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.940> they

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
artists think about themselves and they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.120 
artists think about themselves and they
kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.480> have<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.959> if<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
kind of have to if you think about it I

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.210 
kind of have to if you think about it I
will<00:03:29.550> be<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.000> exception<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:31.080> as<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.040> get

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
will be the exception and as you get

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.520 
will be the exception and as you get
older<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> you're<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.360> game<00:03:33.540> longer<00:03:34.140> you

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
older and you're in the game longer you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.710 
older and you're in the game longer you
begin<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.980> realize<00:03:35.160> if<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.209> were<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
begin to realize if you were the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.110 
begin to realize if you were the
exception<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:37.770> know<00:03:37.920> by<00:03:38.130> now<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.850> then

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
exception you would know by now so then

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.120 
exception you would know by now so then
a<00:03:39.150> different<00:03:39.660> kind<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.080> hopefulness<00:03:40.680> takes

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
a different kind of hopefulness takes

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.000 
a different kind of hopefulness takes
over<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.850> would<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.739> just

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
over and that would be if I can just

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.190 
over and that would be if I can just
stay<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.310> line<00:03:44.730> if<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.810> stay<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
stay in line if I can just stay the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.320 
stay in line if I can just stay the
course<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.150> general

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
course but I think that the general

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.590 
course but I think that the general
misconception<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.500> young<00:03:49.709> artist<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.489> that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
misconception of a young artist is that

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.960 
misconception of a young artist is that
they<00:03:51.920> will<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.310> exception

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
they will be the exception

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.020 
they will be the exception
I<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:55.140> talent<00:03:55.620> plays<00:03:55.860> very<00:03:56.100> little<00:03:56.400> role<00:03:56.640> in

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I think talent plays very little role in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.500 
I think talent plays very little role in
the<00:03:57.780> success<00:03:58.260> or<00:03:58.440> failure<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.190> work<00:03:59.400> of<00:04:00.360> an

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the success or failure of a work of an

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.630 
the success or failure of a work of an
artist<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.140> think<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:02.220> really<00:04:02.610> a

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
artist I think it's it's really a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.270 
artist I think it's it's really a
question<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:04.070> persistence<00:04:06.560> hard<00:04:07.560> work<00:04:07.950> and

question of persistence hard work and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.170
