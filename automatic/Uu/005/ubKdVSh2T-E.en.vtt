looks<00:00:58.020> ok<00:00:59.510> double-checked<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.370> all<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
looks ok double-checked all the all the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
looks ok double-checked all the all the
fasteners<00:01:03.210> almost<00:01:03.840> nuts<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> screws<00:01:04.650> and

fasteners almost nuts and screws and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
fasteners almost nuts and screws and
bolts<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:08.600> don't<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> what's<00:01:09.900> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
bolts on it so I don't know what's going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
bolts on it so I don't know what's going
to<00:01:10.200> happen<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.340> guess<00:01:11.580> we're<00:01:11.760> going

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to happen here but I guess we're going

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.410 
to happen here but I guess we're going
to<00:01:11.970> find<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:13.340> also<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:15.380> have<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:19.790> had<00:01:20.790> turned<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to find out also I have I had turned the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
to find out also I have I had turned the
oil<00:01:21.720> pressure<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:24.860> turn<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
oil pressure of way up turn it up to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.840 
oil pressure of way up turn it up to
about<00:01:26.700> 13<00:01:28.189> about<00:01:29.189> 13<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> half<00:01:30.060> pounds

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.210 

and<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.480> is<00:01:34.630> crankshaft<00:01:35.260> number<00:01:35.680> six<00:01:35.979> this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and this is crankshaft number six this

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.110 
and this is crankshaft number six this
is<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.540> modified<00:01:38.430> another<00:01:39.430> modified

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
is a modified another modified

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.429 
is a modified another modified
crankshaft

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.359 

I've<00:01:44.740> been<00:01:44.950> working<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.460> for<00:01:45.520> some<00:01:45.969> time

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.959 

the<00:01:48.880> improvements<00:01:50.429> from<00:01:51.429> all<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.820> other

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
the improvements from all the other

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.950 
the improvements from all the other
crank<00:01:52.359> cast<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.939> hopefully<00:01:55.570> an

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
crank cast this is hopefully an

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.850 
crank cast this is hopefully an
improvement

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.719 

so

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
so

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.130 
so
with<00:02:02.299> this<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.890> test<00:02:04.219> 100

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
with this this is going to be test 100

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.369 
with this this is going to be test 100
this<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.289> going<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.530> be<00:02:06.619> 4,000<00:02:07.430> rpm<00:02:08.080> for<00:02:09.080> five

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
this is going to be 4,000 rpm for five

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.040 
this is going to be 4,000 rpm for five
minutes<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.239> don't<00:02:11.480> know<00:02:11.599> what's<00:02:11.840> gonna

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
minutes and I don't know what's gonna

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.020 
minutes and I don't know what's gonna
happen<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.489> miss<00:02:14.000> we'll<00:02:14.180> find<00:02:14.480> out

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:32.030 

okay<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.200> blast<00:02:21.890> shield<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.730> place

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920 

we'll<00:02:32.550> see<00:02:32.790> what<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.030> does<00:02:33.270> we're<00:02:33.569> gonna<00:02:33.660> run

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
we'll see what it does we're gonna run

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.199 
we'll see what it does we're gonna run
it<00:02:34.050> up<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.220> 4,000<00:02:35.220> or<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> end<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:36.030> gonna

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
it up to 4,000 or at the end I'm gonna

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.339 
it up to 4,000 or at the end I'm gonna
time<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.569> for<00:02:36.900> five<00:02:37.110> minutes<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:39.140> hope<00:02:40.140> it

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
time it for five minutes and I hope it

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.369 
time it for five minutes and I hope it
still<00:02:40.620> runs<00:02:40.920> after<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.870> they'll<00:02:42.870> find<00:02:43.140> out

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
still runs after this they'll find out

00:02:43.379 --> 00:04:01.140 
still runs after this they'll find out
so<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:43.950> go

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.360 

no<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:02.660> not<00:04:02.810> gonna<00:04:03.050> make<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:06.560> not<00:04:06.920> get<00:04:07.220> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
no it's not gonna make it's not get the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.780 
no it's not gonna make it's not get the
plate<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.850> know<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:09.260> know<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.520> slows<00:04:10.760> down

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
plate you know I know but it slows down

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.730 
plate you know I know but it slows down
like<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.600> know<00:04:11.780> what's<00:04:12.140> happened<00:04:12.590> it's

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
like that I know what's happened it's

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.900 
like that I know what's happened it's
it's<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:14.120> damaged<00:04:14.630> its<00:04:14.900> crankshaft<00:04:15.910> anyway

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
it's just damaged its crankshaft anyway

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.140 
it's just damaged its crankshaft anyway
well<00:04:17.360> it<00:04:17.510> made<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.930> about<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.880> half

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
well it made it about back to the a half

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.870 
well it made it about back to the a half
minutes<00:04:20.630> ended<00:04:21.250> into<00:04:22.250> its<00:04:22.550> five<00:04:22.820> minute<00:04:23.320> test

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
minutes ended into its five minute test

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.500 
minutes ended into its five minute test
so<00:04:27.130> when<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.220> slows<00:04:28.490> down<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.330> know

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
so when it slows down like that I know

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.930 
so when it slows down like that I know
what<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:29.930> means<00:04:30.260> it's<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.130> prank<00:04:34.610> ship

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
what that means it's it's a prank ship

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
what that means it's it's a prank ship
damaged<00:04:35.480> easily

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.960 

anyway<00:04:38.520> well<00:04:39.410> this<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.590> part<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.979> testing<00:04:41.220> I

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
anyway well this is part of testing I

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.790 
anyway well this is part of testing I
knew<00:04:42.389> what<00:04:42.570> was<00:04:42.690> going<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:42.990> happen<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.530> wouldn't

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
knew what was going to happen I wouldn't

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.770 
knew what was going to happen I wouldn't
have<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.160> test<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.699> so<00:04:45.919> anyway<00:04:47.630> we'll<00:04:48.630> have

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
have to test it so anyway we'll have

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.219 
have to test it so anyway we'll have
another<00:04:49.020> test<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:51.300> kind<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.690> goes<00:04:51.900> with<00:04:54.229> goes

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
another test this kind of goes with goes

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.470 
another test this kind of goes with goes
with<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.590> territory

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.189 

that's<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.260> end<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.440> test<00:05:00.710> number<00:05:01.010> one

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.570 

well<00:05:06.210> yeah<00:05:07.210> an<00:05:07.749> update<00:05:08.199> I<00:05:08.529> caught<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.520> time

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
well yeah an update I caught it in time

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.820 
well yeah an update I caught it in time
before<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:10.779> could<00:05:10.930> damage<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.469> crankshaft

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
before it could damage the crankshaft

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.649 
before it could damage the crankshaft
the<00:05:13.499> miserable<00:05:14.499> v8<00:05:14.889> on<00:05:15.490> test<00:05:15.819> number<00:05:15.909> 100

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
the miserable v8 on test number 100

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.469 
the miserable v8 on test number 100
still<00:05:16.930> works<00:05:17.169> okay<00:05:17.710> however<00:05:20.219> it<00:05:21.219> just<00:05:22.150> can't

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
still works okay however it just can't

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.519 
still works okay however it just can't
take<00:05:22.689> those<00:05:22.900> long<00:05:23.229> runs<00:05:23.529> like<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:25.529> engine

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
take those long runs like that engine

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:43.130 
take those long runs like that engine
still<00:05:26.770> runs<00:05:27.039> fine

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.730 

the<00:05:44.140> whiling<00:05:44.530> system<00:05:45.010> just<00:05:45.250> hasn't<00:05:46.680> come<00:05:47.680> up

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
the whiling system just hasn't come up

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.830 
the whiling system just hasn't come up
to<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.160> point<00:05:48.370> yet<00:05:48.670> where<00:05:48.730> I<00:05:48.940> can<00:05:49.240> run<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.570> any

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
to the point yet where I can run it any

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.940 
to the point yet where I can run it any
longer<00:05:50.440> than<00:05:50.790> two<00:05:51.790> or<00:05:51.910> three<00:05:51.940> minutes<00:05:52.950> at

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
longer than two or three minutes at

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.760 
longer than two or three minutes at
those<00:05:54.250> high<00:05:54.460> speeds<00:05:55.260> at<00:05:56.430> 1200<00:05:57.430> rpm<00:05:58.290> 2,000<00:05:59.290> rpm

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
those high speeds at 1200 rpm 2,000 rpm

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.030 
those high speeds at 1200 rpm 2,000 rpm
he'll<00:06:00.010> run<00:06:00.220> all<00:06:00.430> day<00:06:00.640> long<00:06:00.940> but<00:06:01.800> those<00:06:02.800> higher

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
he'll run all day long but those higher

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.560 
he'll run all day long but those higher
speeds<00:06:03.310> that<00:06:03.760> can<00:06:03.940> only<00:06:04.120> run<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.510> for<00:06:04.720> just<00:06:04.900> a

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
speeds that can only run it for just a

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.980 
speeds that can only run it for just a
just<00:06:07.570> a<00:06:07.750> minute<00:06:08.080> or<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:08.470> that's<00:06:09.010> about<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.340> I

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
just a minute or so that's about it I

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.990 
just a minute or so that's about it I
know<00:06:10.990> from<00:06:11.560> experience<00:06:11.740> when<00:06:12.520> it<00:06:12.670> starts

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
know from experience when it starts

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.650 
know from experience when it starts
slowing<00:06:13.270> down<00:06:13.600> that<00:06:13.660> that<00:06:14.380> means<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.890> it's

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
slowing down that that means that it's

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.610 
slowing down that that means that it's
it's<00:06:16.660> overheated<00:06:17.290> his<00:06:17.380> crank<00:06:17.770> shift<00:06:18.100> so

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
it's overheated his crank shift so

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.470 
it's overheated his crank shift so
luckily<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.650> grabbed<00:06:21.100> it<00:06:21.280> and<00:06:21.340> shut<00:06:21.940> it<00:06:22.090> off<00:06:22.240> in

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
luckily I grabbed it and shut it off in

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.680 
luckily I grabbed it and shut it off in
time

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
time

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.390 
time
other<00:06:25.690> crank<00:06:26.110> shafts<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.650> had<00:06:26.800> me<00:06:26.920> shut<00:06:27.130> it<00:06:27.250> off

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
other crank shafts I had me shut it off

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.810 
other crank shafts I had me shut it off
in<00:06:27.640> time<00:06:27.880> and<00:06:28.150> I've<00:06:28.270> had<00:06:28.540> some<00:06:29.520> both<00:06:30.520> had

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
in time and I've had some both had

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.810 
in time and I've had some both had
meltdown<00:06:31.360> so<00:06:31.950> this<00:06:32.950> is<00:06:33.100> part<00:06:33.310> of<00:06:33.400> learning

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
meltdown so this is part of learning

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.940 
meltdown so this is part of learning
I've<00:06:33.970> learned<00:06:34.210> when<00:06:34.930> it<00:06:35.050> starts<00:06:35.380> slowing<00:06:35.650> down

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
I've learned when it starts slowing down

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.350 
I've learned when it starts slowing down
to<00:06:36.220> shut<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.550> off<00:06:36.700> because<00:06:36.970> it's<00:06:37.330> gonna<00:06:38.080> blow

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
to shut it off because it's gonna blow

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.300 
to shut it off because it's gonna blow
but<00:06:40.360> looks<00:06:41.170> like<00:06:41.350> it<00:06:41.530> made<00:06:41.800> it<00:06:41.950> through<00:06:42.130> this

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
but looks like it made it through this

00:06:42.310 --> 00:07:02.089 
but looks like it made it through this
desk

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:07.050 

yeah<00:07:03.870> also<00:07:04.979> please<00:07:05.979> remember<00:07:06.009> it's<00:07:06.879> only

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
yeah also please remember it's only

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:14.460 
yeah also please remember it's only
plastic<00:07:10.199> that's<00:07:11.199> the<00:07:11.500> end<00:07:11.590> of<00:07:11.680> test<00:07:11.919> 100
