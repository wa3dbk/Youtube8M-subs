my<00:00:13.910> whole<00:00:14.120> idea<00:00:14.480> was<00:00:14.960> about<00:00:15.290> this<00:00:16.100> was<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.520> real

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
my whole idea was about this was to real

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.940 
my whole idea was about this was to real
aspects<00:00:17.270> of<00:00:17.390> Japan<00:00:17.780> so<00:00:18.440> not<00:00:18.620> the<00:00:18.770> obvious

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
aspects of Japan so not the obvious

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
abstract observations are made there

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.250 
abstract observations are made there
this<00:00:29.060> was<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.300> beginning<00:00:29.570> of<00:00:29.900> this<00:00:30.050> project

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
this was the beginning of this project

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.709 
this was the beginning of this project
last<00:00:30.650> season<00:00:31.130> called<00:00:31.580> takaku<00:00:32.090> which<00:00:32.300> is<00:00:32.480> which

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
last season called takaku which is which

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.830 
last season called takaku which is which
means<00:00:32.989> clothes<00:00:33.920> country<00:00:34.670> because<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.450> think<00:00:35.600> a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
means clothes country because I think a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.510 
means clothes country because I think a
lot<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:35.990> the<00:00:36.170> reasons<00:00:36.440> why<00:00:36.590> Japan<00:00:37.040> is<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.310> way

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
lot of the reasons why Japan is the way

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.490 
lot of the reasons why Japan is the way
is<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:37.910> because<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.270> was<00:00:38.300> closed<00:00:38.990> for<00:00:39.170> hundreds

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
is it because it was closed for hundreds

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.580 
is it because it was closed for hundreds
of<00:00:39.560> years<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.850> external<00:00:41.570> world<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.930> this

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
of years to the external world and this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.770 
of years to the external world and this
season<00:00:42.890> it's<00:00:43.490> called<00:00:43.820> kaizoku<00:00:44.450> which<00:00:44.570> means

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
season it's called kaizoku which means

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.020 
season it's called kaizoku which means
open<00:00:45.170> country<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.070> it's<00:00:46.190> about<00:00:46.250> how<00:00:46.610> Japan

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
crystals that hang off the dress which

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.050 
crystals that hang off the dress which
are<00:01:16.789> pollen<00:01:17.979> which<00:01:18.979> gets<00:01:19.219> released<00:01:19.579> so<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.909> was

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
are pollen which gets released so it was

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.989 
are pollen which gets released so it was
the<00:01:20.149> idea<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.649> symbolizing<00:01:21.649> an<00:01:22.249> opening<00:01:22.759> or<00:01:22.909> a

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
the idea of symbolizing an opening or a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.109 
the idea of symbolizing an opening or a
new<00:01:23.359> beginning<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.920> dress<00:01:25.189> moves<00:01:25.459> around<00:01:25.819> and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
new beginning the dress moves around and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.679 
new beginning the dress moves around and
what<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:26.420> releases<00:01:27.079> can<00:01:27.380> also<00:01:28.329> suggest<00:01:29.329> the

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
what it releases can also suggest the

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.389 
what it releases can also suggest the
idea<00:01:29.749> of<00:01:30.020> moving<00:01:30.170> around<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.219> releases

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
idea of moving around so it releases

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.919 
idea of moving around so it releases
this<00:01:31.819> thing<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.240> kind<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.509> goes<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.869> a

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
this thing that kind of goes on a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:40.080 
this thing that kind of goes on a
further<00:01:33.109> journey

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.980 

you<00:01:40.899> can<00:01:41.079> see<00:01:41.409> gold<00:01:42.280> next<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.179> crystals<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you can see gold next to crystals and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.260 
you can see gold next to crystals and
next<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.009> white<00:01:45.219> of<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.609> column<00:01:46.000> which<00:01:46.149> is

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
next to the white of the column which is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.349 
next to the white of the column which is
paper<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.100> thought<00:01:48.369> their

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
paper because I thought their

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.520 
paper because I thought their
ingredients<00:01:49.840> who<00:01:49.929> know<00:01:50.109> really<00:01:50.259> feet

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
ingredients who know really feet

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.469 
ingredients who know really feet
together<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.759> thought<00:01:51.939> it<00:01:52.179> was<00:01:52.270> like<00:01:52.450> a

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
together and I thought it was like a

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.330 
together and I thought it was like a
jewelry<00:01:52.929> box<00:01:52.960> almost<00:01:53.679> but<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.009> dress

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
jewelry box almost but as a dress

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.429 
jewelry box almost but as a dress
because<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.420> know<00:01:55.539> it's<00:01:55.689> almost<00:01:55.929> like<00:01:56.229> this

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
because you know it's almost like this

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.699 
because you know it's almost like this
sort<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:57.149> timelessness<00:01:58.149> as<00:01:58.539> well<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.140> gold

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
sort of timelessness as well of the gold

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.520 
sort of timelessness as well of the gold
and<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.360> crystal<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.630> way<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> shape<00:02:02.380> of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and the crystal and the way the shape of

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.230 
and the crystal and the way the shape of
the<00:02:02.590> pollen<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.280> almost<00:02:03.609> could<00:02:03.909> have<00:02:04.030> been

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
the pollen is it almost could have been

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.100 
the pollen is it almost could have been
like<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.549> know<00:02:06.579> Japanese<00:02:07.149> jewelry<00:02:07.539> box<00:02:07.780> but

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
like you know Japanese jewelry box but

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.309 
like you know Japanese jewelry box but
sort<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.640> expanded<00:02:09.640> into<00:02:09.879> a<00:02:09.910> dress<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.959> also

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
sort of expanded into a dress is also

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.460 
sort of expanded into a dress is also
about<00:02:18.269> technology<00:02:19.269> because<00:02:20.079> it's<00:02:20.230> remote

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
about technology because it's remote

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.069 
about technology because it's remote
controlled<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.790> figures<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.660> wear<00:02:22.870> it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
controlled and the figures can wear it

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.390 
controlled and the figures can wear it
but<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.349> can<00:02:23.440> also<00:02:23.590> remote<00:02:23.920> control<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
but you can also remote control the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.250 
but you can also remote control the
dress<00:02:24.579> herself<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.329> see<00:02:25.540> her<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.019> film

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
dress herself so you see her in the film

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.039 
dress herself so you see her in the film
where<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.370> she<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.599> dress<00:02:28.840> but

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
where you know she is in the dress but

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.630 
where you know she is in the dress but
then<00:02:29.170> she<00:02:29.349> leaves<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.739> dress<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.220> she<00:02:30.310> starts

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
then she leaves the dress and she starts

anything that I've done especially all

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.009 
anything that I've done especially all
the<00:02:39.790> pieces<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.090> done<00:02:40.239> with<00:02:40.360> swarovski<00:02:40.870> have

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
the pieces of done with swarovski have

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.080 
the pieces of done with swarovski have
always<00:02:41.290> had<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.860> ascent<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
always had this ascent you know the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.520 
always had this ascent you know the
government<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.540> sense<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.959> life<00:02:44.200> let's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
government to the sense of life let's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.370 
government to the sense of life let's
say<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:44.799> they<00:02:45.069> always<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.880> shown<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:47.170> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
say so they always have to be shown in a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.610 
say so they always have to be shown in a
way<00:02:48.030> where<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.810> what<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.230> story<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
way where you can see what the story is

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.250 
way where you can see what the story is
so<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> think<00:02:51.549> it's<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> do<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.150> doing<00:02:52.780> justice

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
so I think it's to do with doing justice

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.160 
so I think it's to do with doing justice
to<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.530> idea<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.389> doing<00:02:55.389> justice<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.810> what<00:02:56.049> it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
to the idea and doing justice to what it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.739 
to the idea and doing justice to what it
was<00:02:56.290> inspired<00:02:56.650> by
