00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.650
 case let's try the 1.7 voucher is the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.530
 snapshot of 1.7 and all its variants and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.730
 well then also the minecraft for 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.879
 all the versions that are going 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.040
 updating for each version that comes out 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.750
 well you have to go on the website 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.989
 that I'll leave you in the description of 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.330
 video and downloads you this file worth 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.750
 is winrar I will also leave the link 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.050
 discharge 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.350
 winrar and good once downloaded only 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.030
 put on the desk 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 they know 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.500
 and they give him here that he will be with java or if 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 do not open it with java open with java 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.650
 if you do not have java then scarlett that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.650
 download what 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.720
 well then you register well 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 register you see it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:37.460
 and then now is the important step not to 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:41.570
 das in edit profile here a bit profile a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.030
 you will leave without this marked you and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.240
 you have to check where it says Able 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.360
 volume experiments version without up 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.590
 shorts are you worth the marks you give in 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.240
 hyeres and now you'll have all the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.140
 subjects are good in this case are 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.539
 of 1.7 because as we can see the 1.7 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.899
 it is already here updated but as yet 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.610
 did not officially come out you can not enter 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.549
 but as we can see here we have all 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.069
 the versions and even the 1.0 up 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.010
 because the last one in this case is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.840
 the 1.7 point 2 but we can not enter 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.690
 ok because it's not up to date 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.110
 ok but for example if we want to enter 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.060
 in a snapshot ok let's go 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.459
 well in this one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.300
 It is also worth almost everything in the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.819
 naftas or everything but it is not yet the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.609
 official voucher 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.420
 because the official let's say it's already for 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:45.489
 create a server of the 1.7 and all this 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.249
 well, this is the snap shot balona 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.739
 of the various snapshots that there are in 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:54.010
 this snapshot because we see that it is already 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.909
 almost anything does not vary much one of 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.790
 other 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.459
 we see is that even the flowers 1 also 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.609
 we had double grass because we have the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.129
 crystals of colors and so on and so on and 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.340
 well we also have for example 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.360
 clear defects 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.360
 but look 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.920
 this of the feet is worth and good several 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.580
 several things but basically for 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.020
 show you how to play in any 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.380
 snapshot of getting out of any 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.040
 version immediately when the good 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.270
 bring it to the public and well, as 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.430
 have all the versions without 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.800
 download every time you take a 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.800
 version a new michaels is worth here the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 you will have all of the 1.0 to the last 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.570
 of all you just need to 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.960
 download and this and nothing else does 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.120
 missing or extract xerez or rare things 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.940
