00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello yellen i am carlos mine and i am going to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 tell 5 things I want to do before 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 die 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.099
 first of all I want to travel where I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 guide the soul where the destination wants 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.340
 because I know that everything that comes my 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.760
 life will be to benefit your means of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 topic seriously, the only time it has 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.080
 gone on a trip out of Spain has been the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.080
 French border and Ireland 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.280
 with the summer course of the becoming or 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.380
 block with the grasshopper academy of 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.770
 I think that in this is a visit to 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.510
 the two in second place I would like to be 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 university student at public university 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 from Barcelona to study culture 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.710
 audiovisual and from there take 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.620
 branches of graphic design in third place 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.500
 I would like to finish the race 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.410
 ballet and contemporary because I 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.930
 I stayed at the beginning of the fifth grade and what 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.449
 I had to leave for several reasons but 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.030
 the most important reason was the economy 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.360
 and as a result the number four is 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.770
 solve all the problems 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.600
 of my family because when 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 lack of money the relations between 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.030
 families are affected believe me and in 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 fifth place to our leaders and in 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.729
 fifth place knows a series of 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.040

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.130
