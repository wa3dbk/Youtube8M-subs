00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
its volume because it is a deep

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.100

it was kind of weighing down my hair and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.850 
it was kind of weighing down my hair and
also<00:03:35.269> even<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.019> dye<00:03:36.200> your<00:03:36.230> hair<00:03:36.560> this

out your hair or trying to get it shine
again<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.150> would<00:03:47.930> actually<00:03:48.230> not<00:03:48.980> style<00:03:49.730> your

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
away because when you do that it causes

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.420

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
that will actually help with the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.140 
that will actually help with the
