00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 with an apron right 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.660
 Look how nice this apron was. 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.330
 made with a pair of jeans 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 jeans benson that's it we even 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 I brought you here to show you the pants. 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.900
 jeans and even the leg of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.760
 pants turned the bar to make the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.949
 That's what you're going to say. 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.660
 need only dance and a pulse that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 against argentina will and will do here 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.870
 to tie back and the handle we'll go 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 use fabric and if a range of 4 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 centimeters per e mail and we go 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.930
 divide her so you take a meter and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.449
 the middle of the fabric and then cut better 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 drop two of 75 to tie so all 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.899
 that's right 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 and another track on top of a meter that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.600
 can also be cut in the middle to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.890
 to look to tie and to make this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 the sides 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 we go or not and then we have 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.280
 This template to cut is right here. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 This is what we cut here, right? 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.369
 the pants tore the pants off the bar 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 now we'll cut the pocket and now 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.110
 that we are going to do a patch that applies 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 We are going to use the term stick 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.900
 and then and now we 'll stick here 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.869
 pocket is that we can make a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.409
 Folhinha then there to stay the same 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.030
 You pick up a little button and you do not 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.670
 Middle and here we made a little warmth 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.430
 for the straight sewing machine a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.549
 straight stitching that now we're going to hit 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.600

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.020
