 the levels expected for many 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.880

 to the origins and an expansion in the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.530

 formerly microsoft and capcom 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.900

 commented nothing in any local way 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.020
 some still lack a lot of fabric that 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.790
 cut in this sense but it has already 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.830

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 departure of one at any time and 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.570
 change to another one without problems the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 system is simple playing with a friend 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.320
 can help move forward and also to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 develop our own departure 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640
 getting experience points for 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.290
 our useful game to develop the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.850
 character beyond what we can 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.400
 do in our universe 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.770
 something else if we finish a mission in the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
 our friend's campaign this will be marked 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.640
 as finished in our console so 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.160
 that we can move in a lonely way 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.470
 and cooperative at the same time playing even 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 sections of the game that may remain 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.520
 away at first and it will not be 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.710
 necessary to repeat the missions already done 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.260
 unless we want to do it for some 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.900
 reason naturally when a user 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.150
 enter into cooperative mode will assume the role
