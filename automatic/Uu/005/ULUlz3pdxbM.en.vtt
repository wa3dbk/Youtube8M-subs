problem<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.450> me<00:01:36.870> when<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> play<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
problem at all for me when I play in

problem at all for me when I play in
different<00:01:38.430> positions<00:01:38.940> it<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.300> really

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
different positions it don't really

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.230 
different positions it don't really
change<00:01:39.690> my<00:01:40.050> attitude<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:41.070> probably<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
change my attitude or probably the way I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.310 
change my attitude or probably the way I
approach<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> game

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
approach the game

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.520 
approach the game
I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.950> people<00:01:44.070> read<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.910> more<00:01:45.090> than

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
I think people read into a lot more than

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.810 
I think people read into a lot more than
then<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.680> should<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> try<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.729> keep

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
then they should I like to try and keep
