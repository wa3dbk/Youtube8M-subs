can<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> pretty<00:00:26.609> tedious<00:00:26.880> technique<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
can be a pretty tedious technique to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.320 
can be a pretty tedious technique to
rank<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:28.039> but<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.550> evidence

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
rank up but if you want some evidence

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.609 
rank up but if you want some evidence
that<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.599> starts<00:00:30.779> way<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> rank<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> was

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that it starts way to rank up I was

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.670 
that it starts way to rank up I was
first<00:00:31.859> prestige<00:00:32.279> 46<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.930> 8<00:00:34.140> p.m.<00:00:34.440> yesterday

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
was actually 50 hours i think i was like

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
was actually 50 hours i think i was like
49<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> SEC<00:00:42.660> receipt<00:00:42.899> i<00:00:42.989> learn<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> whole

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
49 on the SEC receipt i learn a whole

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
49 on the SEC receipt i learn a whole
lap<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.829> prestige<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.510> overnight<00:00:45.899> obviously

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
lap of prestige just overnight obviously

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
lap of prestige just overnight obviously
the<00:00:46.410> public's<00:00:46.710> p<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> moment<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.460> that's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the public's p at the moment so that's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
the public's p at the moment so that's
obviously<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:48.719> why<00:00:48.960> i've<00:00:49.050> gone<00:00:49.170> up

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
obviously a reason why i've gone up

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
obviously a reason why i've gone up
faster<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.250> still<00:00:50.430> regardless<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
faster but still regardless it is the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
faster but still regardless it is the
fastest<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> rank<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.320> obviously<00:00:52.860> some<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
fastest way to rank up obviously some of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
fastest way to rank up obviously some of
you<00:00:53.610> may<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.320> new<00:00:55.410> town

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you may not actually have the new town

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.939 
you may not actually have the new town

there<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.520> another<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> another<00:01:00.750> way

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
there are another but it is another way

greater<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.910> link<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.960> other<00:01:04.530> people

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
greater to link up but other people

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.130 
greater to link up but other people
haven't<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.100> looked<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.400> again<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140

possible<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.509> great<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> rank<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
possible what the great way to rank up

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.440 
possible what the great way to rank up
is<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> prestige<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.850> gun<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> may

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is is to prestige your gun and it may

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
is is to prestige your gun and it may
seem<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> an<00:01:22.380> annoying<00:01:22.770> process

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
seem like a bit of an annoying process

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.410 
seem like a bit of an annoying process
because<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> lose<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.119> your

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
because you lose all your your

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990 
because you lose all your your
attachment<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.740> proceed<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.820> gun

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
attachment but when you proceed your gun

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
attachment but when you proceed your gun
you<00:01:27.450> basically<00:01:27.630> play<00:01:27.869> let<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.049> try<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.259> find

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you basically play let me try and find

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
you basically play let me try and find
the<00:01:28.530> attachment<00:01:28.829> split<00:01:28.979> their<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.670> reset
