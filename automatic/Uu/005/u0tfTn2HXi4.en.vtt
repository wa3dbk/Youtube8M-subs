here now let's look at something else

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.460 
here now let's look at something else
take<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.320> one<00:02:20.500> off<00:02:20.709> now<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:26.260> one

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
take this one off now this one this one

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.020 
take this one off now this one this one
is<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.620> little<00:02:26.739> hard<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> take<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.640> off

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.900 

which<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.180> good<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.510> bad<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.660> guess<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.820> know

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
which is good and bad I guess you know

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.830 
which is good and bad I guess you know
you<00:02:33.970> don't<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.269> worry<00:02:34.390> about<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.630> falling

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
you don't have to worry about it falling

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.979 
you don't have to worry about it falling
off<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.970> I'm<00:02:40.090> glad<00:02:40.209> I'm<00:02:40.360> doing<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:40.840> real

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
off but I'm glad I'm doing this in real

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.020 
off but I'm glad I'm doing this in real
time<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.650> hear<00:02:41.799> how<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> little

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
time so you can hear how it is a little

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.520 
time so you can hear how it is a little
on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> difficult<00:02:43.930> side<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.260> take<00:02:44.380> off<00:02:46.530> now

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
on the difficult side to take off now

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.199 
on the difficult side to take off now
part<00:02:47.829> of<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.190> because<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.880> have<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
part of that is because I have the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.759 
part of that is because I have the
tempered<00:02:49.510> glass<00:02:49.630> screen<00:02:49.870> protector<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.590> there

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
tempered glass screen protector on there

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.680 
tempered glass screen protector on there
so<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.820> adds<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.269> bit<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> extra

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
so that adds a little bit of extra

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.340 
so that adds a little bit of extra
thickness<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:55.060> let's<00:02:55.239> um<00:02:55.360> let's<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.200> one

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
thickness so let's um let's get this one

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.150 
thickness so let's um let's get this one
off

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.460 

this<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.460> don't<00:03:03.700> want<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.880> come<00:03:04.000> off

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
this really don't want to come off

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.520 
this really don't want to come off
