00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
do for meals but then you're almost

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.240

what's the difference between four or
five<00:01:13.870> meals<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.229> might<00:01:14.350> as<00:01:14.440> well<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:14.710> spread

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
five meals you might as well just spread

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.560 
five meals you might as well just spread
them<00:01:15.430> out<00:01:15.460> over<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.760> whole<00:01:15.909> day<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.390> not<00:01:16.540> have

do you Vince have to spend on groceries
and<00:01:23.409> supplements<00:01:24.220> for<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.460> week<00:01:24.840> hmmm<00:01:25.840> that's<00:01:26.110> a

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
and supplements for a week hmmm that's a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
and supplements for a week hmmm that's a
good<00:01:26.380> question<00:01:26.590> um<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.400> think<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.719> do<00:01:28.840> about

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
good question um I think we do about

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.210 
good question um I think we do about
$175<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:31.390> two<00:01:31.570> hundred<00:01:31.689> dollars<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.109> week<00:01:32.229> and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.240 

we're<00:01:36.820> gonna<00:01:36.940> be<00:01:37.120> looking<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.570> training

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we're gonna be looking at training

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.070 
we're gonna be looking at training
volume<00:01:39.250> today<00:01:39.520> we're<00:01:40.240> gonna<00:01:40.330> be<00:01:40.570> asking<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
volume today we're gonna be asking the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800 
volume today we're gonna be asking the
question<00:01:41.500> how<00:01:41.710> many<00:01:41.980> sets<00:01:42.460> should<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.510> do

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
question how many sets should you do

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
question how many sets should you do
what<00:01:44.530> makes<00:01:44.770> sense<00:01:45.130> based<00:01:45.370> on<00:01:45.670> your<00:01:46.000> goal

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
what makes sense based on your goal

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.430 
what makes sense based on your goal
intensity<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:50.550> inversely<00:01:51.550> related<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.900> volume

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
intensity is inversely related to volume

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.420 
intensity is inversely related to volume
so<00:01:54.430> basically<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.660> more<00:01:55.930> volume<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.980> the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
so basically the more volume you do the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.700 
so basically the more volume you do the
less<00:01:57.670> intense<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.480> workout<00:01:58.870> will<00:01:59.050> be<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
less intense the workout will be the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.310 
less intense the workout will be the
more<00:01:59.950> intensity<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.660> less<00:02:01.870> volume

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
more intensity you do the less volume

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.560 
more intensity you do the less volume
you'll<00:02:02.650> be<00:02:02.770> able<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.040> handle<00:02:03.340> there's<00:02:04.300> just<00:02:04.420> no

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
you'll be able to handle there's just no

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.290 
you'll be able to handle there's just no
way<00:02:04.840> around<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.440> this<00:02:05.650> is<00:02:05.830> just<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.280> reality<00:02:06.790> you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
way around it this is just a reality you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.260 
way around it this is just a reality you
must<00:02:07.570> accept<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.380> anybody<00:02:08.920> who<00:02:09.369> tries<00:02:09.760> to<00:02:09.790> do

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
must accept and anybody who tries to do

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.120 
must accept and anybody who tries to do
both<00:02:10.540> well<00:02:11.440> they're<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.740> kidding

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
both well they're just kidding

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.260 
both well they're just kidding
themselves<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:12.730> we're<00:02:12.880> going<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.090> take<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
themselves now we're going to take a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.000 
themselves now we're going to take a
look<00:02:13.540> at<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> bunch<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.230> different<00:02:14.530> factors

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
look at a bunch of the different factors

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.220 
look at a bunch of the different factors
different<00:02:15.520> things<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.790> need<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.000> consider

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
different things we need to consider

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
different things we need to consider
when<00:02:17.230> we're<00:02:17.380> figuring<00:02:17.620> out<00:02:17.980> how<00:02:18.220> much<00:02:18.430> volume

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
when we're figuring out how much volume

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.660 
when we're figuring out how much volume
we<00:02:19.360> should<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> first<00:02:21.190> thing<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
we should do so the first thing is that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.820 
we should do so the first thing is that
we<00:02:21.850> also<00:02:22.030> know<00:02:22.300> sets<00:02:22.720> are<00:02:22.959> inversely<00:02:23.709> related

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
we also know sets are inversely related

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.660 
we also know sets are inversely related
to<00:02:24.490> reps<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.900> more<00:02:26.170> sets<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:27.130> or<00:02:27.459> less

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to reps so the more sets you do or less

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.960 
to reps so the more sets you do or less
reps<00:02:28.120> you'll<00:02:29.080> be<00:02:29.230> able<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.440> do<00:02:29.680> doing<00:02:30.250> 10<00:02:30.550> sets

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
reps you'll be able to do doing 10 sets

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.380 
reps you'll be able to do doing 10 sets
on<00:02:31.300> bicep<00:02:32.230> curls<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.740> not<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.760> same<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.209> doing

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
on bicep curls is not the same as doing

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.850 
on bicep curls is not the same as doing
10<00:02:34.810> sets<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.410> squats<00:02:36.390> your<00:02:37.390> hormonal<00:02:38.320> system

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
different when doing those workouts most

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.259

people<00:02:47.890> take<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.280> limits<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.760> their<00:02:48.880> vision
