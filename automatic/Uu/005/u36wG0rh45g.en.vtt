00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.570 

when<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.380> start<00:00:10.620> looking<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> floors<00:00:11.280> I

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
when we start looking at the floors I

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.910 
when we start looking at the floors I
quickly<00:00:12.330> decided<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.019> wanted<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.769> can

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
quickly decided I wanted one that I can

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.829 
quickly decided I wanted one that I can
install<00:00:14.160> myself<00:00:14.670> I'd<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.420> had<00:00:15.540> no

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
install myself I'd really had no

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870

knowledge<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.410> flooring<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:16.890> all<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.279> laid

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
knowledge of flooring at all we laid

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.550 
knowledge of flooring at all we laid
down<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.270> floor<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.869> less<00:00:19.170> than<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.439> day

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
down the floor in less than a day

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.689 
down the floor in less than a day
probably<00:00:20.039> eight<00:00:20.160> hours

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
probably eight hours

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429 
probably eight hours
I<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> process<00:00:21.869> definitely<00:00:22.199> was

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I think the process definitely was

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.019 
I think the process definitely was
easier<00:00:22.859> than<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.130> thought<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.609> originally

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
easier than I thought it was originally

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
easier than I thought it was originally
