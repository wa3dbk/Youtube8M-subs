00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi guys it's great pancakes and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.850
 today I find you for a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.710
 new little video so you have 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.050
 no doubt could see the trailer of the new 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 extinguishing mode that will be present on 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 this call of duty vust so so if I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.690
 you put this trailer is not for 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 nothing is true that I said to many 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 of people I even said that on video that I 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 did not buy 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 precisely this call of duty ghost then in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.220
 done if I do not do video it's for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.990
 a very specific reason I wanted you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.239
 take out two survivor guides so one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 on city ​​and one diaries in two 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.160
 days I typed 3 run I typed three 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 sets here I tried three parts gc 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.309
 3 deco I do not know I do not know why 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.399
 I frankly I'm tired I'm getting 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 fart what and that's where 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 I came to ask myself the question 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.010
 must I take a break in zombie I 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.769
 wanted to already bought gta 5 and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.899
 I could not buy it and frankly it 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.820
 are there at the moment the zombie with the decorations 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.949
 it's true that frankly it's me 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.930
 breaks the balls of your homework can 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.920
 not do a normal part when I 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.090
 look at the rankings I tell you 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.390
 yeah well what are we doing records 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.619
 that's just a cost 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 play with good players I know very 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.320
 well I 'll be able to type scores but at 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.509
 every time there is a fucking decor that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.130
 just stop the party and I think 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.780
 I'm not alone in this case so 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 I think you some of you 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 also feel a little bit what I 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.340
 feel and so here I am asked the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 question do not I have to do 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.240
 a little break in zambia I do not know 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.060
 maybe not a little break but in 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.940
 any case play anything else let 's say 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.050
 some time and going on youtube 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.729
 I came across this trailer 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.929
 it is true that it made me very much 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.030
 think about zombie mode so I think 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.039
 that in fact just a movie says 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.539
 ward 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.119
 finally want to get plenty of 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.549
 pockets simply because it draws 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.340
 the best of the old opus 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.890
 so there as 2 the best of the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.330
 better parks let's say that part 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 who saved anyway the simple coop to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.770
 because of these zombies a step to hide 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200
 it was really about them it's a saint 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.129
 it's a game mode that is beautiful 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.270
 and loved the community so 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.780
 ghost they wanted to do the same for 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.220
 make money 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.830
 Anyway, I do not care that they have 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 wanted to do that to make money 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.300
 let's say if it's a little bit of a 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.690
 kind of zombie fashion that we can do 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.010
 dodging and all and that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.440
 I mean it's not like fashion 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 survival of mw3 and ben why not I 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.860
 may be celebrating the game survival mode 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.360
 mw3 is not my thing but 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.410
 it's true that I'm going to maybe 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.180
 put in other games you come back in 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.670
 does because we say it's true 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 that I do not worry I'm going when 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090
 even do some cowards near you prepares 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 videos of the challenges in zombies there is 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.170
 no problem I will stay 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.270
 mostly in zombies but I'm going 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.650
 try to end I will not try I 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.110
 will do I think others play from 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.760
 survival and why not exactly this mode 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.190
 extinction so I hope he 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.020
 will not look like mw3's survival mode too 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.130
 it's true that I did not really like it 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.630
 there are quite a few players who loved her 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.080
 but me it's true that it's not too much 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.870
 my thing 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.370
 so I'm not going to make you either a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.440
 trailer analysis but what I could 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.330
 see it looks a little bit like 10 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.780
 hours fair or stop games like 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
 what what 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.140
 games a little alien all that stuff 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.820
 makes me think of alien mr alien vs 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.970
 predator i have on ps3 besides 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.040
 I had to play two hours on play so 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.959
 it's true that I frankly I see 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.700
 not me I think it will not be at all 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.470
 like the zombie but what will be when 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.880
 even the survival aspect is what 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.840
 I like the atmosphere in fact when we 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.900
 look at the trailer we are in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 the atmosphere already but it's true that the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.050
 top it would be that there could be 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.880
 package everything and that it's not just about the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.730
 Wushu campus 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.620
 things like that what do I have 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.239
 could see there is a napalm strike a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.820
 moment in predator which I think it 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.360
 there will be strict scores strict key 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.890
 Here bonuses to unlock and everything so 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.269
 here I am not going to buy the game 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.680
 directly I want to see what it gives 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.150
 and then I 'll finally do you 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.560
 I will buy the game if I like it 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.760
 you will make videos on where 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.860
 I will try to survive the most 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.300
 long time his 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.340
 precisely in the sleeves because I 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.310
 think it's going to be the sleeves of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.690
 brief waves here is you understood so 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.190
 hoping that the servers are 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.490
 better done on this call of duty ghost 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.650
 so with regard to a little bit the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.329
 next gen 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.579
 I do not intend to buy it before a lot of 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.890
 time i think so i will buy call of 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.440
 duty on ps3 and I'll leave on 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.490
 next gen not before not before end 2014 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.760
 finally not before call of duty black 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.169
 ops 3 what's up before he does us 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.150
 let's do it and hope they come out 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.580
 a zombie I heard that he 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.950
 was going to go out a special call of duty 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.230
 are bi so obviously we can not 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.780
 know 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.310
 the ghost and not even out that people 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.790
 are throwing rumors about on the next 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.010
 call of 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.480
 short are in any case that it would be 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.280
 not bad that there is still zombie in 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.360
 my next call of after ghost because 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.720
 that it is true that otherwise I would have 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.790
 the only 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.070
 because despite everything they slipped to 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.570
 these zombies What is there is the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.600
 best survival game in my eyes 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.800
 So here it made three brief 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.810
 weeks that you have not done any 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.910
 little videos so I told you I 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.070
 wanted to get you out of the challenges I had not 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.010
 the motivation I wanted to feel in 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.350
 guinea survivors doing runs and deco 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.180
 I registered for the tournament versus ps3 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.520
 organized by logos the zombie 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.840
 factory I have not been selected this 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.000
 a shame because I would be fine 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.270
 broke out finally short here I wanted you 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.910
 out of three videos but I could not 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.190
 the first week of vacation 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.169
 I'm not at home so here I am 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.640

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.960

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.060
