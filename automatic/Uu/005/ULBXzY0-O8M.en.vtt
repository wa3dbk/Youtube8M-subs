00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 These days I was thinking how it would be 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.600
 if I were the creator of any game 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.980
 if I helped in the production finally to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 first thing that came into my head 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.960
 was to put some tolla gem some 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.260
 easter egg macabre there to let the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.300
 players with fears is crazy uncles yellow 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 waterfall and thinking about that I ended up 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.550
 seeing what it would take to make some videos 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 cool about macabre easter eggs or 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.119
 terrible at last 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 so if you like easter eggs you can 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 make sure this video sucks then 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.470
 It already leaves I liked it that underneath we go 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 over there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 the sonic one of the most famous characters 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 of games and I would never imagine that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.129
 one of your games would have an easter egg 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 so hideous so the sonic cbt an easter 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.469
 egg is literally at the beginning of the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.570
 play if you make a sequence of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.700
 buttons down low down left 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 right you will be taken to a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.030
 secret screen where you can listen to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.649
 songs and sounds of the game there begins 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 bizarre you select certain 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:09.990
 music and sound effects it an order 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:12.390
 For sure you go to another secret screen and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 There are very bizarre things in her. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 on this screen plus a sinister song 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 in the background you can see in the image of the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.580
 sonic 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.580
 only he's kind of bizarre with his face 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.180
 I formed through whatever it is awful 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.369
 so 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.670
 in the middle of the screen also has a message 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.590
 in Japanese the translation means 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.460
 Infinite fun follows inter countries 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.750
 who owns the game and imagines 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.780
 Then you think the fuck is magic 15 and 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.079
 then the word maggi means demon 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 It's macabre so you soon think you have 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.310
 some demon on this screen this should be 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 one of the most macabre steroids without 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 notion of sonic but let's relax that it has 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 an explanation that uproar and one of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.299
 the creators of these phases of sonic 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.520
 His nickname is , I do not know. 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.979
 it may be kind of a reference to it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 an easter egg for him, of course. 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.869
 sega also knew that this was the name of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.869
 a demon and did a lagen exchange there 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.780
 this fox is another sensational game that 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.660
 that you turn your mind to the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.209
 sides blew and one of the phases of the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.519
 game you can kill a gray bird 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.709
 if you see that step and kill it yourself 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.599
 Go to another world, a game in this world. 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.720
 the planets have eyes 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:44.209
 yes the planets have bizarre eye bitch 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.209
 It seems like we 're watching, I do not know. 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.490
 in viana is also the portal game 2 that 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.270
 In fact a very crazy game is good game in 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.400
 Good game has one thing and is strange in 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.130
 one of the game rooms you can hear 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.130
 weird noises normal thing until 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.170
 For this game, some noise in the village alone. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.480
 that if you take these sounds and put 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.730
 them into a program that transforms audio 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.280
 and image you see a mean image 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.190
 basically strange noises without 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:38.720
 sense also saw an image without 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:44.140
 sense but look what pizarro she is 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.140
 It seems that something is written there is tense. 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.049
 what madness in the game rhythm with trox 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.629
 I do not know how to speak on an easter 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.939
 egg you see a ghost and sister is 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.069
 macabre can be found in a 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.260
 mission of the game that takes place within a 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.120
 hotel during this mission you can 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.129
 find a locked door 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.409
 only if you use a lock it 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.480
 Kind of a thing she own the door to you. 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.579
 Can you open that door and go to a 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.889
 secret area of â€‹â€‹the game there when you 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:23.160
 enters the bathroom of your hotel you see 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.160
 This bizarre ghost is 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.060
 your local content on me 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.919
 Gta goes city is also a full game 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.350
 of macabre stars in the game you can 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.169
 find a butcher shop and so far so good 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.680
 The best you'll find there is what the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.539
 chicken bacon sausages not with this not 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.250
 need to think bullshit and even a goal 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.250
 even though it has not happened and you too 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.880
 can find human chunks type 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.979

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.729
 skeleton is missing just one 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.780
 piece of his arm that you can see 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.090
 at the butchery 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.729

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.979

 they cooked his arm twitter is 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:32.849
