just<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.490> quick<00:00:20.610> look<00:00:20.849> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> traction

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
just a quick look at the traction

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.440 
just a quick look at the traction
full-length<00:00:22.080> herringbone<00:00:23.090> from<00:00:24.090> heel<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.300> toe

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
full-length herringbone from heel to toe

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.400 
full-length herringbone from heel to toe
and<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:26.460> absolutely<00:00:27.000> phenomenal<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:28.230> does

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and it's absolutely phenomenal it does

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.749 
and it's absolutely phenomenal it does
take<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> little<00:00:28.770> bit<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.009> break-in<00:00:29.340> time

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
take a little bit of break-in time

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.729 
take a little bit of break-in time
well<00:00:30.270> once<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.750> happens<00:00:31.169> you're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
well once that happens you're going to

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.120 
well once that happens you're going to
be<00:00:31.860> good<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.329> break-in<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.840> mostly

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
be good to go the break-in time mostly

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
be good to go the break-in time mostly
is<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.700> lateral<00:00:36.149> movements<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
is for the lateral movements so on a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
is for the lateral movements so on a
dusty<00:00:38.250> floor<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> things<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.149> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
dusty floor and things like that this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
dusty floor and things like that this
the<00:00:39.570> rubber<00:00:39.780> starts<00:00:40.079> off<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> bit

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the rubber starts off a bit

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
the rubber starts off a bit
I'd<00:00:41.880> say<00:00:42.120> slick<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.020> quite<00:00:43.230> sticky<00:00:43.590> but

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I'd say slick it's not quite sticky but

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'd say slick it's not quite sticky but
it<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> slick<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.720> after<00:00:45.720> it<00:00:45.810> breaks<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it is slick and after it breaks in it's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.940 
it is slick and after it breaks in it's
perfectly<00:00:46.950> fine<00:00:47.220> rubbers<00:00:48.150> real<00:00:48.420> pliable<00:00:48.950> know

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
perfectly fine rubbers real pliable know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.140 
perfectly fine rubbers real pliable know
how<00:00:50.280> well<00:00:50.430> you're<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.790> able<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.970> see

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
how well you're going to be able to see

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.410 
how well you're going to be able to see
that<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:52.800> moves<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.150> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that but it moves very very well and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.520 
that but it moves very very well and
this<00:00:54.990> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.520> near-perfect<00:00:56.520> traction<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.720> after

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
this is a near-perfect traction so after

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
this is a near-perfect traction so after
break-in<00:00:58.740> time<00:00:59.040> it's<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.940> good

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
break-in time it's a very very good

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
break-in time it's a very very good
solid<00:01:00.990> surface<00:01:01.640> cushion<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.060> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
solid surface cushion is pretty much the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
solid surface cushion is pretty much the
same<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.720> all<00:01:03.990> adidas<00:01:04.379> models<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
same in all adidas models you have a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
same in all adidas models you have a
full<00:01:05.579> length<00:01:06.320> compression<00:01:07.320> molded<00:01:07.590> EBA<00:01:07.829> foam

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
full length compression molded EBA foam

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
full length compression molded EBA foam
not<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.880> models<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.479> most<00:01:09.720> models<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
not all models but most models this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.410 
not all models but most models this
one's<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.310> nice<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.240> more

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
one's really nice it's a little bit more

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.499 
one's really nice it's a little bit more
firm<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.290> crazy-like<00:01:13.770> -<00:01:14.009> however<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
firm than the crazy-like - however it is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.779 
firm than the crazy-like - however it is
more<00:01:15.749> responsive<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> same<00:01:16.979> time<00:01:17.219> so<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
more responsive at the same time so and

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.279 
more responsive at the same time so and
it<00:01:17.939> offers<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.329> bit<00:01:18.539> more<00:01:18.659> stability

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
it offers a little bit more stability

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.039 
it offers a little bit more stability
upon<00:01:20.189> heel<00:01:20.429> strikes<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.210> plenty<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
upon heel strikes you have plenty of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
upon heel strikes you have plenty of
cushion<00:01:22.259> impact<00:01:22.799> protection<00:01:23.249> which<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
cushion impact protection which then

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.419 
cushion impact protection which then
flows<00:01:24.329> through<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> forefoot<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:25.530> still

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
flows through the forefoot and still

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:27.980 
flows through the forefoot and still
allows<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.999> have<00:01:27.119> plenty<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> cork<00:01:27.719> field

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
allows you to have plenty of cork field

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.219 
allows you to have plenty of cork field
at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> forefoot<00:01:29.280> area<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> guard<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
at the forefoot area so for a guard this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.069 
at the forefoot area so for a guard this
is<00:01:31.289> pretty<00:01:31.590> much<00:01:31.679> a<00:01:32.009> ideal<00:01:32.609> setup<00:01:32.990> with<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
is pretty much a ideal setup with the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
is pretty much a ideal setup with the
exception<00:01:34.499> it<00:01:34.590> may<00:01:34.679> be<00:01:34.740> something<00:01:35.069> from<00:01:35.369> Nikes

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

exception it may be something from Nikes
camp<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.119> would<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.359> zoom<00:01:36.630> layer

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.129 
chosen I personally prefer this one for
basketball<00:01:41.819> it's<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.569> closest<00:01:42.929> thing<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
basketball it's the closest thing to

basketball it's the closest thing to
leather<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> we've<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.159> quite<00:01:44.280> some

leather that we've had in quite some

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.209 
leather that we've had in quite some
time<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> performance<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> still<00:01:47.069> as

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
our toolbox area and then you also have

our toolbox area and then you also have
a<00:02:30.010> mesh<00:02:30.790> tongue<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.320> quite<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:32.980> good<00:02:33.190> as

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
a mesh tongue it's not quite as good as

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.260 
a mesh tongue it's not quite as good as
the<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:34.150> d0<00:02:34.720> rose<00:02:35.370> 2.5<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.850> definitely

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
the a d0 rose 2.5 but it is definitely

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.000 
the a d0 rose 2.5 but it is definitely
better<00:02:37.450> than<00:02:38.050> most<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.500> other<00:02:38.650> shoes<00:02:38.860> on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
better than most of the other shoes on

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.520 
better than most of the other shoes on
the<00:02:39.070> market<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.450> ventilation<00:02:41.050> one

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the market so I do like ventilation one

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.930 
the market so I do like ventilation one
thing<00:02:41.710> that's<00:02:41.860> good<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> fit<00:02:42.910> is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
thing that's good is that the fit is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.970 
thing that's good is that the fit is
definitely<00:02:43.450> secure<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.260> even<00:02:44.740> if<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
definitely secure so even if the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.920 
definitely secure so even if the
ventilation<00:02:45.430> wasn't<00:02:45.730> great<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.420> wouldn't<00:02:46.780> be

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
ventilation wasn't great it wouldn't be

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.990 
ventilation wasn't great it wouldn't be
too<00:02:47.860> bad<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.250> far<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.460> performance<00:02:48.940> goes

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
too bad as far as performance goes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.520 
too bad as far as performance goes
because<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.720> would<00:02:49.870> not<00:02:49.990> be<00:02:50.140> sliding<00:02:50.470> around

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
because you would not be sliding around

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.650 
because you would not be sliding around
inside<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> shoe<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.940> far<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.300> support<00:02:52.600> is

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
frame which is back here it's a little

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720

something<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> guard<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.530> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.800> want

something that a guard is going to want

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.040 
something that a guard is going to want
so<00:03:06.220> when<00:03:06.370> you're<00:03:06.460> pushing<00:03:06.670> off<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.720> things

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
so when you're pushing off and things

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.050 
so when you're pushing off and things
like<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.260> are<00:03:08.530> doing<00:03:08.740> crosses<00:03:09.250> left<00:03:09.910> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
like that are doing crosses left to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.870 
like that are doing crosses left to
right<00:03:10.240> medial<00:03:10.960> lateral<00:03:11.140> movements<00:03:11.880> that's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
right medial lateral movements that's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.100 
right medial lateral movements that's
pretty<00:03:13.090> much<00:03:13.210> what<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.540> sprint<00:03:13.780> frame<00:03:13.960> is

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
pretty much what that sprint frame is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.380 
pretty much what that sprint frame is
good<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> can't<00:03:15.700> keep<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:16.090> heel

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
good for and it can't keep your heel

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.390 
good for and it can't keep your heel
contained<00:03:16.900> with<00:03:17.500> these<00:03:17.710> two<00:03:17.920> eyelets

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
contained with these two eyelets

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.330 
contained with these two eyelets
as<00:03:18.490> they<00:03:18.910> wrap<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.180> back<00:03:19.860> into<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.950> heel<00:03:21.160> so

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
as they wrap you back into the heel so

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220 
as they wrap you back into the heel so
like<00:03:21.490> I<00:03:21.580> was<00:03:21.670> saying<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.210> previous<00:03:22.570> video<00:03:22.660> if

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
like I was saying in a previous video if

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.900 
like I was saying in a previous video if
you<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.770> look<00:03:23.950> at<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> eyelets<00:03:24.460> just<00:03:24.730> cool

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
you just look at the eyelets just cool

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.110 
you just look at the eyelets just cool
at<00:03:25.120> like<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> 90<00:03:25.690> degree<00:03:25.960> angle<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.910> those<00:03:27.910> are

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
at like a 90 degree angle and those are

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.550 
at like a 90 degree angle and those are
really<00:03:28.270> what's<00:03:28.510> going<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.690> contain<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.230> into

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
really what's going to contain you into
