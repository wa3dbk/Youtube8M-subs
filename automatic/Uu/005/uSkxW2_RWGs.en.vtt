instead<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> putting<00:00:42.450> milk<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.030> add

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
instead of putting milk in here I add

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
instead of putting milk in here I add
some<00:00:45.300> protein<00:00:45.690> powder<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.260> I've<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.829> vanilla

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
some protein powder so I've got vanilla

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860 
some protein powder so I've got vanilla
protein<00:00:47.489> powder<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.180> can't<00:00:48.450> seem<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
protein powder can be can't seem it to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
protein powder can be can't seem it to
be<00:00:48.960> isolates<00:00:49.469> whatever<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.610> but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
be isolates whatever you want but

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.840 
be isolates whatever you want but
obviously<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> vanilla<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.559> replace<00:00:52.920> milk

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
obviously the vanilla will replace milk

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
obviously the vanilla will replace milk
and<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.360> obviously<00:00:54.719> adding<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.320> bit

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and it's obviously adding a little bit

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.049 
and it's obviously adding a little bit
of<00:00:55.500> protein<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.579> I'll<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of protein in there and I'll just put a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.959 
of protein in there and I'll just put a
teaspoon<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> next<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:58.440> protein

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
teaspoon in next I get my protein

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.189 
teaspoon in next I get my protein
requirements<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.059> anyway<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> want

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
requirements in anyway but if you want

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
to put in like a Stroup to make this a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.580 
to put in like a Stroup to make this a
higher<00:01:03.600> protein<00:01:04.670> shop<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
higher protein shop then you can do so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.460 
higher protein shop then you can do so
so<00:01:07.590> real<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:08.640> tights
