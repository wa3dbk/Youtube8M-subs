quest and yeah of course I did it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
the engineering myself you're so yeah if

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.800 
the engineering myself you're so yeah if
you<00:02:42.530> if<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.069> are<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.250> good<00:02:43.610> engineer<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.480> like

you if you are a good engineer or like

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.410 
you if you are a good engineer or like
what<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.250> like<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.180> are

she pretty good I didn't really do much

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.819 
she pretty good I didn't really do much
engineering<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:20.480> yeah<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.349> still<00:03:21.590> managed<00:03:21.799> to

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
engineering but yeah I still managed to

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.409 
engineering but yeah I still managed to
get<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> few<00:03:22.099> levels<00:03:22.430> because<00:03:22.760> that's<00:03:22.970> what<00:03:23.329> I'm
