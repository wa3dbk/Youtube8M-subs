00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
point on this website the service

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.550 
point on this website the service
selection<00:02:05.430> heuristic<00:02:06.060> has<00:02:06.270> been<00:02:06.479> modified<00:02:06.659> so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
selection heuristic has been modified so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.529 
selection heuristic has been modified so
that<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.429> many<00:02:08.580> words<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.239> find

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that in so many words you can find

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.029 
that in so many words you can find
somewhere<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> play<00:02:10.229> that's<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> big

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
somewhere to play that's the big

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
somewhere to play that's the big
people<00:02:11.519> can't<00:02:11.760> find<00:02:12.000> any<00:02:12.180> servers<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.780> think

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
people can't find any servers I think

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.390 
people can't find any servers I think
going<00:02:13.379> through<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.650> every<00:02:13.920> night<00:02:13.950> I've<00:02:14.250> been

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
going through this every night I've been

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
going through this every night I've been
trying<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.909> I<00:02:15.209> can't<00:02:16.140> find<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.439> server

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
trying to play I can't find the server

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.270 
trying to play I can't find the server
the<00:02:16.739> play<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.219> supposedly<00:02:17.939> that's<00:02:18.209> fixed

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the play on so supposedly that's fixed

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.170 
the play on so supposedly that's fixed
now<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:21.090> will<00:02:21.329> be<00:02:21.569> able<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.790> play<00:02:23.790> with

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
now you will be able to play with

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.360 
now you will be able to play with
matches<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.900> closely<00:02:25.200> resemble<00:02:25.859> your<00:02:26.069> ping

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
matches which closely resemble your ping

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.149 
matches which closely resemble your ping
and<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:27.480> network<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.290> latency<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> won't

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
and your network of latency so you won't

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.280 
and your network of latency so you won't
begin<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.609> laggy<00:02:29.790> matches<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.750> that's<00:02:31.079> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
begin and laggy matches now that's the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.130 
begin and laggy matches now that's the
biggest<00:02:31.980> thing<00:02:32.129> um<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.579> on<00:02:33.390> top<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.689> that<00:02:33.930> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
biggest thing um so on top of that that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.479 
biggest thing um so on top of that that
was<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.349> big<00:02:34.530> fix<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:35.069> was<00:02:35.189> what<00:02:35.370> everybody

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
was the big fix that was what everybody

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.039 
was the big fix that was what everybody
wanted<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.359> that's<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.659> four<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.019> five

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
wanted so that's like four or five

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.410 
wanted so that's like four or five
bullet<00:02:37.470> points<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:38.400> fix<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.879> address<00:02:39.150> that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
bullet points to fix and address that

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.229 
bullet points to fix and address that

points<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.109> points<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.859> now<00:03:26.040> things<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.489> a

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
points to two points so now things are a

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.860 
points to two points so now things are a
little<00:03:26.639> bit<00:03:26.819> more<00:03:26.970> balanced<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:27.449> kind<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.720> like

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
little bit more balanced I kind of like

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.899 
little bit more balanced I kind of like
that<00:03:27.900> even<00:03:28.470> though<00:03:28.560> i<00:03:28.620> was<00:03:28.829> i<00:03:29.010> was<00:03:29.430> doing<00:03:29.729> some
