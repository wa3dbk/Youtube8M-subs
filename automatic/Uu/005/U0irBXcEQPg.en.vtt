00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so rather than buying one because I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.009 
so rather than buying one because I
think<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:23.820> about<00:00:23.970> 500<00:00:24.570> bucks<00:00:24.779> or

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
think they're about 500 bucks or

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
think they're about 500 bucks or
something<00:00:25.289> stupid<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:26.630> something<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
something stupid for something that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
something stupid for something that
looks<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.199> pretty<00:00:28.429> poorly<00:00:29.429> made<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
looks like it's pretty poorly made to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.030

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
steal it off my old go-kart because it's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.990 
steal it off my old go-kart because it's
a<00:01:01.579> sadly<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.500> rusting<00:01:04.500> away

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

or<00:01:07.830> something<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.790> idea<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.470> use<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.710> I've

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
or something so my idea is use what I've

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.399 
or something so my idea is use what I've
got<00:01:14.070> rather<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.210> spending<00:01:15.840> money<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
got rather than spending money that I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.340 
got rather than spending money that I
don't<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.869> pair<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
don't need to I was going to pair it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.880 
don't need to I was going to pair it
with<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.729> sr20<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.680> too

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with this sr20 but it's a little bit too

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
with this sr20 but it's a little bit too
big<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> figured<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:25.110> something

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
big so then I figured well go something

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.990 
big so then I figured well go something
smaller<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.189> thinking<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> pairing<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
smaller so I was thinking of pairing it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
smaller so I was thinking of pairing it
with<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.229> reveal<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.350> sniffing<00:01:28.650> later<00:01:28.829> um

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
with this reveal if sniffing later um

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.510 
with this reveal if sniffing later um
which<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:31.110> welded<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> sprocket<00:01:32.009> onto<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
which are welded a sprocket onto it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
which are welded a sprocket onto it
which<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.150> 11<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.509> 12<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.200> some

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
which is I think it's 11 to 12 to some

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.359 
which is I think it's 11 to 12 to some
of<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.970> clutch<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:37.770> really

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of that but the clutch is is really

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.870 
of that but the clutch is is really
and<00:01:39.350> rabies<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:41.189> all<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> they're

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and rabies we all know that they're

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
and rabies we all know that they're
pretty<00:01:42.030> horrible<00:01:42.570> engines<00:01:43.110> they're

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
pretty horrible engines they're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
pretty horrible engines they're
temperamental<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> them

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
temperamental they go when you want them

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
temperamental they go when you want them
to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.159> want<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to go they go and you don't want them to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
to go they go and you don't want them to
go<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.439> them

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
go and they don't go when you want them

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
go and they don't go when you want them
to<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.100> figured<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> something<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> wanted

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to go so figured on something I wanted

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
to go so figured on something I wanted
to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> reliable<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.759> motorized

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to be reliable and then these motorized

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.990 
to be reliable and then these motorized
bike<00:01:54.450> motors<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.020> sick<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:56.130> used<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> ride<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
bike motors are sick I used to ride this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.670 
bike motors are sick I used to ride this

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
yeah yeah so ya thought well rather than

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520 
yeah yeah so ya thought well rather than
resting<00:02:17.400> away<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.670> shed<00:02:17.960> I'll<00:02:18.960> use<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> motor

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
resting away and shed I'll use the motor

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.320 
resting away and shed I'll use the motor
flat<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.100> that's<00:02:20.520> got<00:02:20.700> plenty<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.120> power

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
flat because that's got plenty of power

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.960 
flat because that's got plenty of power
it's<00:02:21.960> got<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> manual<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> red<00:02:22.860> clutch<00:02:23.250> well

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it's got a manual of red clutch well

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.570 
it's got a manual of red clutch well
then<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.720> buy<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> starter<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.340> pull

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then I do is buy a starter a pull

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.540 
then I do is buy a starter a pull
starter<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.870> usually<00:02:28.680> start<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.370> by

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
starter because usually start this by

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.420 
starter because usually start this by
pedaling<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.180> dropping<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> clutch

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
pedaling and then dropping the clutch

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.630 
pedaling and then dropping the clutch
but<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:33.170> drift<00:02:34.170> cart<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.710> not<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.400> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
but on my drift cart it's not going to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.900 
but on my drift cart it's not going to
be<00:02:36.180> able<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.450> pedal<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
be able to pedal so what you can do is

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.820 
be able to pedal so what you can do is
you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.150> unbolt<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.810> apparently<00:02:40.020> by

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
you can unbolt this and apparently by

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.500 
you can unbolt this and apparently by
starter<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.550> go<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.730> air<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> look

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
starter to go on air so I have a look

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.080 
starter to go on air so I have a look
into<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.840> hopefully<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.590> eyes

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
into that hopefully I'm going to eyes

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.630 
into that hopefully I'm going to eyes
sort<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.150> ruined<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:46.050> um<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.710> not<00:02:46.920> find<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.520> way

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
sort of ruined but um if not find a way

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
sort of ruined but um if not find a way
and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:47.910> push<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.600> with<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> mate<00:02:49.080> or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and then push that it with a mate or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.060 
and then push that it with a mate or
something<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:49.970> yeah<00:02:50.970> use<00:02:51.300> that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
something like that but yeah use that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.750 
something like that but yeah use that
for<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> motor<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:55.250> what<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.580> do

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
for the motor and what I'm going to do

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.020 
for the motor and what I'm going to do
is<00:02:57.060> use<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> front<00:02:57.840> end<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.860> a<00:03:00.530> cart

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
is use the front end of this as a cart

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.030 
is use the front end of this as a cart
so<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.720> mount<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.960> sprocket<00:03:04.410> which

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
so I'm going to mount the sprocket which

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.610 
so I'm going to mount the sprocket which
is<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.460> rear<00:03:05.640> tire<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.450> currently<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
is on the rear tire of this currently on

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.530 
is on the rear tire of this currently on
to<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.860> front

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
to the front

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.690 
to the front
somehow<00:03:09.540> mount<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.290> motor<00:03:11.840> onto<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.080> bike

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
somehow mount the motor onto the bike

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.740 
somehow mount the motor onto the bike
probably<00:03:14.700> gonna<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> make<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.330> custom

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
probably gonna have to make up custom

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.590 
probably gonna have to make up custom
mount<00:03:16.020> some<00:03:16.650> sort<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:18.030> hopefully<00:03:18.240> keep

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
mount some sort and then hopefully keep

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.690 
mount some sort and then hopefully keep
brake<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.260> I've<00:03:19.350> got<00:03:19.530> some<00:03:19.740> stopping<00:03:20.190> ability

this melon bark and I've haven't ridden
ridden<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.720> probably<00:03:39.900> four<00:03:40.260> years

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
ridden it in probably four years

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.840 
these casters so the rears obviously
gonna<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.580> these<00:03:56.760> suckers<00:03:58.580> hundred<00:03:59.580> mil<00:03:59.700> any

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
gonna be these suckers hundred mil any

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.810 
gonna be these suckers hundred mil any
now<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> France<00:04:01.370> very<00:04:02.370> little

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
now and then the France very little

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.120 
now and then the France very little
because<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.330> Front's<00:04:03.690> actually<00:04:04.230> don't<00:04:04.500> get

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
because the Front's actually don't get

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.490 
because the Front's actually don't get
driven<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.880> there<00:04:06.270> are<00:04:06.420> any<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.810> stability<00:04:07.020> I

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
driven on there are any for stability I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.110 
driven on there are any for stability I
probably<00:04:07.980> didn't<00:04:08.340> even<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.760> need<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.940> buy

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
probably didn't even really need to buy

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.940 
probably didn't even really need to buy
these<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.570> figured<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.959> may<00:04:10.380> as<00:04:10.410> well<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
these but I figured I may as well so I

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.570 
these but I figured I may as well so I
got<00:04:11.190> smaller<00:04:11.520> ones<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:13.220> if<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.430> actually

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
got smaller ones because if you actually

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.620 
got smaller ones because if you actually
look<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:14.970> these<00:04:15.150> things

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
look on these things

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
look on these things
the<00:04:16.080> wheels<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.530> usually<00:04:17.070> sits<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.730> it<00:04:17.850> like

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
the wheels are usually sits in it like

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.750 
the wheels are usually sits in it like
this<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.190> got<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.340> handbrake

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
this and then it's got a handbrake

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.659 
this and then it's got a handbrake
mechanism<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.020> thing<00:04:22.500> when<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.460> pull<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
mechanism on the thing when you pull the

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.120 
mechanism on the thing when you pull the
handbrake<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.210> lists<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.570> wheel<00:04:24.720> up<00:04:24.930> straight

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
handbrake it lists the wheel up straight

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.330 
handbrake it lists the wheel up straight
and<00:04:27.530> makes<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> backend

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
and makes the backend

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.470 
and makes the backend
kick<00:04:29.910> out<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.680> yeah<00:04:32.160> normal<00:04:32.730> little<00:04:33.240> driving

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
kick out so yeah normal little driving

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.750 
kick out so yeah normal little driving
you're<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.140> be<00:04:34.200> like<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.070> if<00:04:35.610> this

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
you're going to be like this so if this

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.700 
you're going to be like this so if this
wheel<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.180> mounted<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.630> front<00:04:36.870> on<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.440> exact

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
wheel is mounted up front on the exact

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.230 
wheel is mounted up front on the exact
same<00:04:37.920> height<00:04:38.930> they<00:04:39.930> should<00:04:40.230> be<00:04:41.240> relatively

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
same height they should be relatively

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.620 
same height they should be relatively
level<00:04:43.100> that's<00:04:44.100> actually<00:04:44.460> slightly<00:04:44.790> it's

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
level that's actually slightly it's

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.060 
level that's actually slightly it's
permanent<00:04:45.960> oh<00:04:46.020> man<00:04:46.170> that<00:04:46.350> crazy<00:04:46.590> integral

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
permanent oh man that crazy integral

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.430 
permanent oh man that crazy integral
it's<00:04:47.850> actually<00:04:48.090> slightly<00:04:48.330> slightly<00:04:49.140> higher

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
it's actually slightly slightly higher

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.300 
it's actually slightly slightly higher
so<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.830> no<00:04:49.950> Macintoshes<00:04:50.760> wheel<00:04:50.970> unless<00:04:52.310> god

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
so it's no Macintoshes wheel unless god

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.010 
so it's no Macintoshes wheel unless god
the<00:04:53.700> rocks<00:04:53.940> over<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:54.720> it's<00:04:54.840> going<00:04:54.930> to

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the rocks over and then it's going to

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.340 
the rocks over and then it's going to
just<00:04:55.590> glide<00:04:55.890> on<00:04:55.920> those<00:04:56.220> ones<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.290> you

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
just glide on those ones just so you

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.970 
just glide on those ones just so you
don't<00:04:58.440> topple<00:04:58.890> over<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.730> yeah<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:01.710> I'm<00:05:01.800> really

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
don't topple over so yeah so I'm really

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.600 
don't topple over so yeah so I'm really
done<00:05:02.190> too<00:05:02.730> much<00:05:03.650> drawing<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.770> this<00:05:04.890> yet<00:05:05.130> I'm

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
done too much drawing of this yet I'm

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.740 
done too much drawing of this yet I'm
just<00:05:05.670> going<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:05.940> pretty<00:05:06.240> much<00:05:06.300> pull<00:05:06.630> that

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
just going to pretty much pull that

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.630 
just going to pretty much pull that
motor<00:05:06.990> off<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.440> try<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.920> rig<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.220> up<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.520> the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
motor off and try to rig it up to the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.270 
motor off and try to rig it up to the
front<00:05:08.910> end<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.630> then<00:05:10.560> chop<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.130> off

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
front end of this and then chop it off

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.870 
front end of this and then chop it off
and<00:05:12.680> make<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:13.950> little<00:05:14.010> rectangular<00:05:14.670> frame

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
and make like a little rectangular frame

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.140 
and make like a little rectangular frame
up<00:05:15.060> mount<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.050> wheels<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.590> yeah<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.820> think

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
up mount the wheels to it yeah I think

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.580 
up mount the wheels to it yeah I think
the<00:05:18.210> hardest<00:05:18.570> thing<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.960> going<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.440> be

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
the hardest thing is going to be

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.860 
the hardest thing is going to be
mounting<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.040> motor<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.580> then<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.510> second

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
mounting the motor and then the second

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.300 
mounting the motor and then the second
hardest<00:05:22.020> is<00:05:22.440> making<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.950> hand<00:05:23.160> brake

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
hardest is making the hand brake

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.980 
hardest is making the hand brake
mechanism<00:05:23.430> because<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.390> need<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.630> change<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
mechanism because I need to change the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.370 
mechanism because I need to change the
angle<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.320> those<00:05:25.620> casters<00:05:27.140> not<00:05:28.140> quite<00:05:28.350> sure

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
angle of those casters not quite sure

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.290 
angle of those casters not quite sure
how<00:05:29.040> I'm<00:05:29.250> going<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.430> do<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:29.790> think<00:05:30.150> I'm

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
how I'm going to do that I think I'm

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390 
how I'm going to do that I think I'm
getting<00:05:31.200> like<00:05:31.350> door<00:05:31.560> hinges<00:05:31.860> but<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.190> think

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
getting like door hinges but I think

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.550 
getting like door hinges but I think
that<00:05:32.490> it'll<00:05:33.150> be<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> little<00:05:33.480> bit<00:05:33.570> too<00:05:35.330> weak<00:05:36.530> so<00:05:37.530> I

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
that it'll be a little bit too weak so I

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
that it'll be a little bit too weak so I
need<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.800> think<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:38.040> something<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.490> bit

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
need to think of something a little bit

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.340 
need to think of something a little bit
more<00:05:38.610> heavy-duty<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.080> got<00:05:40.170> any<00:05:40.230> ideas

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
more heavy-duty so if you got any ideas

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.260 
more heavy-duty so if you got any ideas
guys<00:05:40.620> let<00:05:41.160> us<00:05:41.250> know<00:05:41.370> it<00:05:41.430> may<00:05:41.640> be<00:05:41.670> sweet<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.150> so
