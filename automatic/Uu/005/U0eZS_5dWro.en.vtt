sounds<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> great<00:00:28.500> strategy<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.939> our

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
sounds like a great strategy now in our

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
sounds like a great strategy now in our
game<00:00:30.269> coming<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.689> though<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> prepared

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
game coming up though have you prepared

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
game coming up though have you prepared
any<00:00:32.550> special<00:00:33.239> strategies<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.840> cloud<00:00:34.050> nine

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
any special strategies for cloud nine

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.600 
any special strategies for cloud nine
because<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.770> seems<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.130> guys<00:00:35.340> may<00:00:35.579> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
because it seems like you guys may be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.200 
because it seems like you guys may be
brewing<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.550> heated<00:00:38.550> rivalry<00:00:38.969> here

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
brewing a bit of a heated rivalry here

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.690 
brewing a bit of a heated rivalry here
so<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.500> haven't<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.160> had<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.520> record

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
so we haven't really had a good record

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.459 
so we haven't really had a good record
against<00:00:42.030> c9<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.480> far<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.320> really

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
against c9 so far but we're really

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
against c9 so far but we're really
focusing<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> results<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> season

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
focusing on the results of the season

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.430 
focusing on the results of the season
we're<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.480> taking<00:00:45.660> every<00:00:45.870> match<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
we're just taking every match one at a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
we're just taking every match one at a
time<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.370> focusing<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> our<00:00:48.420> overall

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
time and just focusing on our overall

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.310 
time and just focusing on our overall
