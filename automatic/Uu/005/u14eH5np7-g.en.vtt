you know there's usually a period in the
beginning<00:02:29.020> which<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.410> every<00:02:29.980> life<00:02:30.190> seems<00:02:30.490> okay

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
beginning which is every life seems okay

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.470 
beginning which is every life seems okay
and<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.230> progressively<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
and then it progressively the the the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.229 
and then it progressively the the the
tension<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.140> know<00:02:35.200> builds<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.180> very

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
tension you know builds and so it's very

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.199 
tension you know builds and so it's very
much<00:02:37.600> similar<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.370> structure<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.060> our

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
much similar to to the structure of our

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.500 
much similar to to the structure of our
