00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
quickly and see how it goes but

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.000 
quickly and see how it goes but
everything<00:04:17.730> from<00:04:17.760> getting<00:04:18.570> traction<00:04:19.080> first

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
everything from getting traction first

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.500 
everything from getting traction first
to<00:04:20.250> second<00:04:20.640> gear<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.880> little<00:04:21.180> bit<00:04:21.299> difficult

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
to second gear is a little bit difficult

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.120 
to second gear is a little bit difficult
right<00:04:21.900> off<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.170> hop<00:04:22.380> but<00:04:22.620> when<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.830> get<00:04:22.980> it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
right off the hop but when you get it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
right off the hop but when you get it
into<00:04:23.400> third<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.850> fourth<00:04:24.060> gear

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
into third and fourth gear

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.720 
into third and fourth gear
there<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.020> almost<00:04:25.290> virtually<00:04:25.860> no<00:04:26.100> real<00:04:26.370> spin

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
there is almost virtually no real spin

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.940 
there is almost virtually no real spin
and<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.510> thing<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.050> smooth<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.890> I

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
and this thing is just smooth and I

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.710 
and this thing is just smooth and I
cannot<00:04:29.190> wait<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.460> upgrade<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.000> tuning<00:04:30.510> I
