that<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> dynamic<00:00:42.629> duo<00:00:42.809> for

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that can be kind of a dynamic duo for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.619 
that can be kind of a dynamic duo for
those<00:00:43.260> guys<00:00:43.469> Brodus<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.160> physical<00:00:44.730> he's<00:00:45.329> on

those guys Brodus is physical he's on
the<00:00:45.780> outside<00:00:45.809> he's<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.680> long-range<00:00:47.280> e

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the outside he's kind of a long-range e

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so I think you know that's gonna that's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
so I think you know that's gonna that's
gonna<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> pretty<00:00:52.710> special<00:00:52.920> combination

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
the game itself but showed at 6-foot 386
pounds<00:01:08.280> why<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.939> many<00:01:09.119> people<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.600> intrigued

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pounds why so many people are intrigued

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
pounds why so many people are intrigued
with<00:01:10.229> him<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> why<00:01:11.070> he<00:01:11.100> would<00:01:11.460> fit<00:01:11.670> perfectly

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
with him and why he would fit perfectly

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
with him and why he would fit perfectly
I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> spread<00:01:13.260> offense<00:01:13.439> he's<00:01:13.950> good

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I think into a spread offense he's good

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
I think into a spread offense he's good
at<00:01:14.189> getting<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> line<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> scrimmage

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and you know escaping press coverage if

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.749 
and you know escaping press coverage if
they<00:01:18.570> try<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> play<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.350> close<00:01:19.680> he's<00:01:20.280> excellent

wide<00:01:32.579> receivers<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.049> able<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> get

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
some separation downfield which I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
some separation downfield which I
thought<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.049> impressive<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> taller<00:01:38.130> kid
