don't you wonder how these huge vehicles
are<00:00:13.090> actually<00:00:13.240> made

showing me around is one of the
company's<00:00:29.540> general<00:00:29.810> managers<00:00:30.470> Tony<00:00:30.830> someone

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
company's general managers Tony someone

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.610 
company's general managers Tony someone
who<00:00:31.910> knows<00:00:32.119> these<00:00:32.300> buses<00:00:32.750> inside<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.500> out

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
who knows these buses inside and out

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.040 
who knows these buses inside and out
Tony<00:00:34.400> I<00:00:34.490> take<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.120> chassis<00:00:35.510> which

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
Tony I take it this is the chassis which

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.810 
Tony I take it this is the chassis which
is<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:36.440> base<00:00:36.590> of<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.040> whole<00:00:37.190> bus<00:00:37.489> right

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
is the base of the whole bus right

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.670 
is the base of the whole bus right
that's<00:00:38.330> correct<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.020> where<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.260> process

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
that's correct this is where the process

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.350 
that's correct this is where the process
begins<00:00:39.710> with<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.370> start<00:00:40.700> chest<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:41.239> we

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
begins with the start chest so what we

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.119 
begins with the start chest so what we
do<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.630> we<00:00:41.780> get<00:00:41.900> it<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:42.140> in<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:42.379> buggy<00:00:42.559> format

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
do is we get it in in this buggy format

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.490 
do is we get it in in this buggy format
we<00:00:43.670> get<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.000> electrics<00:00:44.450> sorted<00:00:44.780> out<00:00:44.930> we<00:00:45.230> slice

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
we get the electrics sorted out we slice

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.500 
we get the electrics sorted out we slice
it<00:00:45.530> in<00:00:45.830> half<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.700> prepare<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.780> then<00:00:49.510> at

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
it in half we prepare it and then at

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.140 
it in half we prepare it and then at
this<00:00:50.660> point<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.320> bus<00:00:51.500> is<00:00:51.680> pretty<00:00:51.860> bare<00:00:52.190> just<00:00:53.000> a

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
this point the bus is pretty bare just a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.900 
this point the bus is pretty bare just a
steel<00:00:53.510> frame<00:00:53.780> supported<00:00:54.710> by<00:00:54.829> wheels<00:00:55.130> with<00:00:55.790> an

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
steel frame supported by wheels with an

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.360 
steel frame supported by wheels with an
engine<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.690> steering<00:00:57.200> mechanism<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.220> is

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
engine and steering mechanism this is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.979 
engine and steering mechanism this is
the<00:00:58.489> only<00:00:58.670> part<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.090> buses<00:00:59.450> it's<00:00:59.570> actually

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
the only part of the buses it's actually

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.380 
the only part of the buses it's actually
steel<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:01.100> gets<00:01:01.280> treated<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:01.970> becomes

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
steel and it gets treated so it becomes

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.689 
steel and it gets treated so it becomes
corrosion<00:01:02.960> resistant<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.220> from<00:01:04.460> here

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
corrosion resistant and then from here

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.730 
corrosion resistant and then from here
on<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.239> rest<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.690> bus<00:01:05.899> besides

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
on in the rest of the bus besides

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.560 
on in the rest of the bus besides
everything<00:01:07.460> else<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.880> panels<00:01:08.270> are<00:01:08.450> all

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
everything else the panels are all

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.320 
everything else the panels are all
totally<00:01:09.020> Elementium<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.310> speaking<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.940> panel

totally Elementium and speaking of panel

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.810 
totally Elementium and speaking of panel
it's<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.080> next<00:01:12.259> stage<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.830> process

the bus is coming together like a giant

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020 
the bus is coming together like a giant
3d<00:01:27.720> jigsaw<00:01:28.170> puzzle<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.520> starting<00:01:29.940> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
3d jigsaw puzzle and it's starting to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.980 
3d jigsaw puzzle and it's starting to
actually<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.750> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually look like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.430 
actually look like
well<00:01:31.410> reveal<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.900> helping<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.050> hold<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> all

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
well reveal but helping to hold it all

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.650 
well reveal but helping to hold it all
together<00:01:34.620> is<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.310> big<00:01:35.640> bounce<00:01:35.940> or<00:01:36.240> gadget

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
together is this big bounce or gadget

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.410 
together is this big bounce or gadget
this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> called<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.710> cobalt<00:01:38.160> join<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.180> comes

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this is called a cobalt join it comes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.970 
this is called a cobalt join it comes
all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.690> way<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:40.080> Switzerland<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
all the way from Switzerland and what it

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.370 
all the way from Switzerland and what it
basically<00:01:41.100> does<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> helps<00:01:42.750> connect<00:01:43.170> our

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
basically does is that helps connect our

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.280 
basically does is that helps connect our
aluminium<00:01:43.950> extrusions<00:01:44.640> nice<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.300> tightly<00:01:45.540> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
aluminium extrusions nice and tightly so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.590 
aluminium extrusions nice and tightly so
it<00:01:46.320> gets<00:01:46.650> riveted<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> held<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.360> place

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it gets riveted in held into place

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
it gets riveted in held into place
there's<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.110> glue<00:01:49.380> function<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.010> there<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's a glue function in there that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.610 
there's a glue function in there that
keeps<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> nice<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.060> secure<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> really

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
keeps it nice and secure so it really

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.770 
keeps it nice and secure so it really
makes<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> busts<00:01:53.370> very<00:01:53.610> strong<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.450> very

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
makes the busts very strong but very

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.750 
makes the busts very strong but very
safe<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.440> it's<00:01:55.560> also<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:56.040> light<00:01:56.370> because

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
safe and it's also very light because

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.360 
safe and it's also very light because
it's<00:01:56.880> aluminium<00:01:57.360> impressed<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.620> more

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
it's aluminium impressed there's more

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.390
