00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
muscle that push I top up and down side

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
muscle that push I top up and down side
to<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> torques

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to side and one that kind of torques

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
to side and one that kind of torques
your<00:01:24.570> eye<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.830> look<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.130> another

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
your eye so you can look up another

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
your eye so you can look up another
angle<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.330> any<00:01:27.990> direction

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

see<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.340> saying<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:30.600> lazy<00:01:31.229> eye<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.829> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
see I'm saying a lazy eye is one of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
see I'm saying a lazy eye is one of
those<00:01:32.070> muscles<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.549> too<00:01:32.700> long<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
those muscles are too long and so it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
those muscles are too long and so it
allows<00:01:34.470> other<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> pull<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> too<00:01:35.640> tight<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
allows other one to pull it too tight to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
allows other one to pull it too tight to
one<00:01:36.600> side<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.130> pull<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.140> are<00:01:40.250> that's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
one side and then pull it and are that's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.590 
one side and then pull it and are that's
not<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.329> called<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
not what I have I have what is called a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.620 
not what I have I have what is called a
suppression<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.500> suppression<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.909> basically

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
suppression a suppression is basically

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
suppression a suppression is basically
where<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.049> brain<00:01:46.909> tries<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> focus<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
where your brain tries to focus out of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
where your brain tries to focus out of
one<00:01:48.810> eye<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.799> focus<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.520> of

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
one eye it doesn't focus all time out of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
one eye it doesn't focus all time out of
the<00:01:50.670> other<00:01:50.820> eye<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.110> close<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.590> eye
