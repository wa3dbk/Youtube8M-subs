00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
yeah then I have my guitars have those

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.250 
yeah then I have my guitars have those
who<00:02:51.489> know<00:02:51.700> about<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:52.180> guitars<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:56.049> them

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
who know about my guitars they know them

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.679 
who know about my guitars they know them
usually<00:02:56.769> for<00:02:57.040> several<00:02:57.549> reasons<00:02:57.999> and<00:02:58.239> one<00:02:58.540> of

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
usually for several reasons and one of

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.009 
usually for several reasons and one of
them<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.890> distinct<00:03:00.689> features<00:03:01.689> of

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
them is one of the distinct features of

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.890 
them is one of the distinct features of
my<00:03:02.140> guitars<00:03:02.469> I<00:03:02.620> use<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:03.189> like<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.730> use<00:03:03.879> this<00:03:04.180> tone

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
my guitars I use I like to use this tone

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
my guitars I use I like to use this tone
wood<00:03:05.109> Spanish<00:03:05.620> cedar<00:03:06.420> very<00:03:07.420> much<00:03:08.459> another

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
wood Spanish cedar very much another

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.589 
wood Spanish cedar very much another
thing<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.129> recognized<00:03:12.760> from<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.389> usually<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
thing we recognized from is usually the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.360 
thing we recognized from is usually the
Arctic<00:03:16.599> birch<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.680> use<00:03:17.829> for<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.159> top

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
Arctic birch that we use for the top

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.229 
Arctic birch that we use for the top
material<00:03:18.939> whether<00:03:19.749> it's<00:03:20.019> playing<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:22.060> an

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
material whether it's playing like an

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.199 
material whether it's playing like an
this<00:03:22.420> guitar<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.079> or<00:03:23.639> that<00:03:24.639> could<00:03:24.879> be<00:03:25.060> one<00:03:25.180> of

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
this guitar here or that could be one of

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.640 
this guitar here or that could be one of
the<00:03:25.389> nicest<00:03:25.719> pieces

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.509 

and<00:03:30.640> there's<00:03:30.819> some<00:03:31.000> really<00:03:31.299> exciting<00:03:31.690> pieces

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
and there's some really exciting pieces

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.750 
and there's some really exciting pieces
but<00:03:33.569> something<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.720> isn't<00:03:35.760> commercially

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
but something that isn't commercially

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.089 
but something that isn't commercially
available<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:37.330> stone<00:03:37.629> would<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.470> it's<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.799> bit<00:03:38.980> of

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
available a stone would so it's a bit of

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.100 
available a stone would so it's a bit of
a<00:03:39.159> struggle<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.730> pay<00:03:39.879> them<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.360> for<00:03:40.810> us<00:03:40.900> it's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
a struggle to pay them and for us it's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:50.280 
a struggle to pay them and for us it's
been<00:03:41.319> like<00:03:48.030> quite<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.060> job<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.599> be<00:03:49.629> able<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:50.170> use

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
been like quite a job to be able to use

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.619 
been like quite a job to be able to use
it<00:03:50.470> was<00:03:50.799> so<00:03:51.010> much<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.430> later<00:03:51.730> when<00:03:52.060> we<00:03:52.180> get<00:03:52.450> to

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
it was so much more later when we get to

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:00.960 
it was so much more later when we get to
the<00:03:52.780> myths<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:58.560> another<00:03:59.610> special<00:04:00.610> technique

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
the myths of another special technique

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.240 
the myths of another special technique
we<00:04:01.180> use<00:04:01.329> for<00:04:01.660> drying<00:04:02.019> our<00:04:02.260> wood<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.950> called

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
we use for drying our wood it's called

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.849 
we use for drying our wood it's called
thermal<00:04:03.519> treatment<00:04:04.060> itself<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.650> wood

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859

dust in a few decades

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.550 
dust in a few decades
so<00:04:14.470> there's<00:04:15.280> several<00:04:16.320> things<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.919> one<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.940> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
so there's several things so one of the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.969 
so there's several things so one of the
would<00:04:20.639> harden<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:22.050> so<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.199> resin<00:04:23.560> things<00:04:23.800> I

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
would harden and so the resin things I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.730 
would harden and so the resin things I
thought<00:04:25.530> crystallized

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
thought crystallized

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:36.200 
thought crystallized
and<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.190> pores<00:04:27.460> clean<00:04:28.449> out<00:04:34.590> there's<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.770> huge

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
and the pores clean out there's a huge

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.140 
and the pores clean out there's a huge

one of the researched facts about the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
thermal treatment then it makes the wood

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.850 
thermal treatment then it makes the wood
more<00:04:54.940> stable<00:04:55.750> regarding<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.320> relative

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
more stable regarding the relative

humidity thermal treated wood reacts
slower<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.479> changes<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.560> humidity<00:05:05.770> and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
slower to the changes in humidity and

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.589 
slower to the changes in humidity and
less<00:05:06.610> that's<00:05:07.479> basically<00:05:07.930> what<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.349> does<00:05:08.560> so

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
less that's basically what it does so

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.100 
less that's basically what it does so
Nick<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:12.070> lot<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.370> thermal<00:05:12.550> treated<00:05:12.910> wood

Nick the lot of thermal treated wood

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.330 
Nick the lot of thermal treated wood
would<00:05:14.110> be<00:05:14.320> bit<00:05:15.280> more<00:05:15.550> relaxed<00:05:16.060> or<00:05:16.240> observes

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
so far we haven't found a way to do it

so far we haven't found a way to do it
one<00:05:28.860> of<00:05:28.949> our<00:05:29.069> main<00:05:29.280> main<00:05:29.819> was<00:05:30.090> because<00:05:30.479> the

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
one of our main main was because the

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.839 
one of our main main was because the
Spanish<00:05:31.169> cedar<00:05:31.349> is<00:05:31.530> one<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.860> these<00:05:32.009> was<00:05:32.189> only
