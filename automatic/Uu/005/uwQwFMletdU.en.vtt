on this my only concern is you've got a
quality<00:01:53.630> quarterback<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.650> got<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.799> team<00:01:55.070> still

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
quality quarterback you got a team still

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.950 
quality quarterback you got a team still
playing<00:01:55.729> for<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.570> conference<00:01:56.900> championship

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
playing for the conference championship

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830 
playing for the conference championship
and<00:01:57.700> take<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> look<00:01:58.939> at<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> line<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.299> mean<00:01:59.630> where

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and take a look at the line I mean where

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.569 
and take a look at the line I mean where
the<00:01:59.930> line<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.140> right<00:02:00.470> now<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.340> touchdown

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
the line is right now it's a touchdown

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.539 
the line is right now it's a touchdown
higher<00:02:02.119> if<00:02:02.450> they<00:02:02.720> don't<00:02:02.900> lose<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.049> game<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.130> I

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
higher if they don't lose that game so I

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.460 
higher if they don't lose that game so I
think<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.090> losing<00:02:05.420> if<00:02:05.869> you're<00:02:06.079> looking<00:02:06.229> to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
think we're losing if you're looking to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.740 
think we're losing if you're looking to
play<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.770> favor<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.130> or<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.790> underdog<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.360> think

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
play the favor I or the underdog I think

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.120 
play the favor I or the underdog I think
you're<00:02:08.840> losing<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.229> touchdown<00:02:09.619> worth<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.009> value

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
you're losing a touchdown worth of value

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.309 
you're losing a touchdown worth of value
not<00:02:10.700> saying<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.050> happen<00:02:12.140> that

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
that's not the right side

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.280 
that's not the right side
but<00:02:13.939> I'm<00:02:14.030> always<00:02:14.209> looking<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.719> value<00:02:15.079> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
what UNLV has done the last two weeks

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.040 
what UNLV has done the last two weeks
they<00:04:55.820> are<00:04:56.000> playing<00:04:56.240> really<00:04:56.509> good<00:04:56.690> football

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
they are playing really good football

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.469 
they are playing really good football
right<00:04:57.530> now<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:57.949> then<00:04:58.340> they<00:04:58.490> held<00:04:58.669> Hawaii<00:04:59.090> and

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
right now and then they held Hawaii and

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.170 
right now and then they held Hawaii and
New<00:04:59.840> Mexico<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.349> ten<00:05:00.620> points<00:05:01.039> each<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.520> think

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
New Mexico to ten points each I think

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.540 
New Mexico to ten points each I think
they're<00:05:02.360> able<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.720> keep<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.139> game<00:05:03.440> close<00:05:03.710> and

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
they're able to keep this game close and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.270 
they're able to keep this game close and
their<00:05:05.389> physical<00:05:06.199> team<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:06.830> think<00:05:07.099> they're

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
their physical team and I think they're

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.040 
their physical team and I think they're
going<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.520> wear<00:05:07.729> down<00:05:07.909> Fresno<00:05:08.449> State<00:05:08.750> I'll
