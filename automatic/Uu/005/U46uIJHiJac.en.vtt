00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello to all of you today's evil 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.269
 city ​​dweller on canadian who had stone 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.120
 desjardins pierre hi hi olivier 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.640
 so duel between them the renault twingo and 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
 the smart forfour two brands of models 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.390
 but yet and are very close 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.560
 exactly because they are the same 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.089
 platforms it's the same 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.380
 motorizations they are assembled even 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.699
 in the same factory 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.499
 but there is still 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.759
 some differences so which one 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.789
 choose that's what have to say everything from 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.789
 after 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.109
 so this third generation of 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.449
 renault trucks we know it long 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.649
 wide and 1 diagonal always in 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.559
 really a break from the 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.250
 previous with five motor doors to 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.960
 the rear 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.370
 you worse on the forfour it remains 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.079
 relatively more classical then will have 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.760
 the differences are not that the 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.660
 front side the back side as it's 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.109
 often there is sharing of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.370
 platforms 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.379
 she goes up in the cutting of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.000
 doors if you look at the doors 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.230
 back they have a cutout 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.460
 different and even the door handle 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.780
 the skins same place yes because 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.489
 at renault she is integrated into life 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.049
 very exactly 1 x the force or even the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.400
 conventional classics she gets 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.590
 stands out much less in the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.579
 circulation than the twingo so their 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.799
 first referees 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.560
 the style is down our preference is going 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.450
 rather towards the twingo more fun more than 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.590
 personality but also addresses a 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.899
 younger clientele 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.990
 whereas the forfour it is seen it is 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.000
 more mature it's more consensual limit 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.770
 each his tastes inside the twingo 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.280
 stone we are dealing with a dashboard 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.390
 we know now here is a little 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.380
 tristoune that's what is criticized there 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.909
 today especially in the definition 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.439
 that we have today plastics are 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.369
 not exceptional but remains in the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.659
 category average 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.520
 but it must be said though that 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.189
 globally whether it's the twingo or the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 forfour we have a nice atmosphere 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.329
 said in this car and in the back 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.100
 so then in the back no miracle 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.289
 at the level of habitability it is correct 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.630
 the same platform there no surprise of 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.430
 this side there by cons the twingo a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.369
 load volume is so a safe 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.270
 bigger than the forfour of some 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.859
 tens of liters 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.240
 it's always nice it's always 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.890
 pleasant and we had already noted in a 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 previous comparative than the twingo 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.369
 despite its relatively small size 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.039
 would feel good to load objects 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.170
 long 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.459
 marion to say the forfour ll more 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.599
 original inside that to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 outside it takes even the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.590
 advantage what is very interesting 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.090
 it is this covered dashboard 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.590
 issue I find we can choose in 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.700
 many colors and I find that very 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.329
 nice and that's something we did not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.709
 not in the twingo 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.390
 this is to hide a little one 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.590
 will say the misery of hard plastics 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.359
 found in the category 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.799
 exactly the aerators rise too 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.470
 nice high level the form saas a geek 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.939
 there are two is soft we will put on the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.739
 flying ergonomics a lot of pimples 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.450
 which is not the case on the twingo and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.430
 especially be careful marriages of 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.840
 colors on the dashboard and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.299
 especially at the console level also 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.859
 one of the white cars at 1300 km 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.120
 and it's already very dirty very marked 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.340
 it's a little bit negative 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.799
 then equipment side for thirteen thousand 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.689
 700 euros on the high finish on the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.060
 twingo called intense but but 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.919
 we have a passion intermediate finish 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.120
 on the smart and necessarily this has some 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.379
 consequences on the team missing 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.639
 you just have to make a choice on the 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.939
 smart forfour we do not air conditioning 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.680
 automatic two series that does not have the 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.329
 twingo by cons the twingo to the alert 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.290
 of crossing line ars had 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.849
 also repercussions at the level of 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.379
 it has options that a close 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.989
 imply features but it's 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.150
 navigation system airlink at 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.280
 renault will have to count 1000 euros then 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.019
 that on the forfour is only 600 euros 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.269
 so in the end equipment and 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.669
 benefits will say benefit so the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.769
 form we are now aboard 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.569
 the ford forfour then reversion 71 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.430
 hot all that is delivered by a three 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.660
 atmospheric cylinders of 1 liter 4 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.710
 doubtful lengthening m 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.930
 and the least we can say is 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.280
 that they're not going to be much bah he 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.200
 does not happen much and this after 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.050
 worse for her a 60 horsepower version 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.230
 deflated forrester version so that's 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.040
 clear you know that love 1 0 to 100 in 15 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.200
 seconds 9 and in addition the console is 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.210
 not so low as that in return 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.600
 since we have four mixed two years 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.870
 for a small city groulx who make 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.850
 better 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.900
 yeah bah that can be explained in particular by the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.130
 we are obliged a little bit 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.630
 always joe the gearbox 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 of mans acts to raise and so 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.930
 you must be exact at the level 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.830
 of behavior then at the level of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.960
 listening behavior is appreciable on 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.910
 not really see there is not a 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.430
 sports character because it's a 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.570
 rear engine and propulsion me there 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.280
 is a problem with the position of 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.010
 conduct do not understand I do not 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.500
 do not understand I have my feet up the 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.800
 very straight folder it's strange where 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.780
 really a time to get used to it 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.669
 without getting too used to 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.580
 final by great it's very much alive 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.139
 it's very good in town why because 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.860
 that you have a turning radius him 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.870
 put 60 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.099
 you turn around in a handkerchief 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.870
 pocket and that's really nice 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.009
 even if it's ugly or the direction to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.229
 hardly too light 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.669
 me you see then same platform but 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.139
 mechanical one could expect to see 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.849
 exactly the same car behind the wheel 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.710
 and well not just why 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.810
 try to scourge lose it and twingo 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.349
 and all light about 100 kilos so 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.150
 it's not it's not nothing the important thing is 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.430
 necessarily it is taken on a meaning to 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.659
 level heaps trend particularly 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.460
 that we join prison that will know a little 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.039
 more tonic given personally I 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.020
 prefers the direction of the twingo to a 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.539
 little more pleasant more direct we will say 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.770
 so in the end, of course, it's not going to be 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.389
 say revolutions these two cars to 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.139
 we advise you clearly points 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.479
 in higher powers 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.460
 especially the 90 horse on the grave ray 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.139
 wide kay no more recommendable than this 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.210
 110 horses and on the forfour alone 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.069
 motor to take here but globally 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.249
 we are dealing with cars one use 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.319
 very good to live 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.119
 me yesterday with 70 points on the 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.469
 suburban clearly a calf of 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.389
 times six times twice twice 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.769
 lanes be windy and I end up on a 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.959
 little flat about the position of 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:37.729
 driving has tightened that you and alexander 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.229
 had been very penalized me that me 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.029
 I like have been affected especially on the 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.259
 twingo is the case on the forfour but 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.879
 it must be recognized that it is not 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.649
 the best driving position of the 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.089
 world 

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:48.469
 whereas yesterday we recapitulate then the 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.019
 smart forfour win at the level of 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.549
 its interior and its equipment but the 

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:53.089
 twingo she wins at the level of 

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:55.669
 aesthetics 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.559
 yeah of his road qualities yeah and 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.479
 in addition she has prices that are 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.189
 below the level of list prices 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.779
 of course sometimes so to ease 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.779
 results win the twingo
