 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.959
 is a network that I believe and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.000
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.300
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.550
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.030

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.880

 continue your contract is only one 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.560
 year and finally the ox thing that I think
