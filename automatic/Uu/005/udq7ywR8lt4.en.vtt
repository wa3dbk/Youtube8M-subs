 allows us to create icons in which 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.590
 we can have direct access 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.570
 much easier for example I 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.490

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.820
 is already open the shortcut from the 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.710
 page of my mac mx on youtube other than

 The functions that you can also do is 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.820
 that you can create call icons is 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 say i press pc and he tells me that if 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.620
 I wish to call this company in command 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.570
 the application of 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.110
 allows to make shortcuts to pages 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.970

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.800

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
 calls that can be on your iphone or on 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.600
 your ipod touch the only thing we have to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.810
 to do is push and with project 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.130
 this application breaks down a menu in 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.340
 which on the left and side 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.590
 Right in the middle appears the icon itself 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.200
 and they realize that I have a series of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 icons with the image of steve jobs for 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.520
 call that company like I do good 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.950
 The first thing I have to do is enter 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.630
 to contacts and search the series of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.259
 contacts that I have in this case 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.380
 let's choose the company college 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.659
 villarrica 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.009
 that head of page has that action 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.899
 has a post page and I what 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.600
 pressed he tells me he can send me 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.880
 an email or send a ms or it can be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.039
 face time in this case for example is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.049
 eye the mail option and they realize and 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.720
 the school icon appears in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.509
 question if you pressed the button that is a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.159
 box I can remove or put one 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.560
 of the boxes that are in this case 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.720
 let's put a white one after you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.780
 You can put a little more brightness if 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.210
 or choose from different types now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.709
 after that from the left side it seems 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.959
 a paint bucket this is in case nothing 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.869
 more you want to create a button with color or 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.269
 in text so you can modify the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.790
 type of letter format for you 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.220
 you can add it in this case to a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790
 title if you realize if I 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.890
 I put here villa 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.739
 and I 'm going to change the color of letters 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.780
 let's put a red color so that 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.969
 you see and you realize it appears in the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.489
 part of inside then here we 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:35.409
 we can create the button with the text 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.390
 inside or what I recommend is 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.849
 put it on the outside now for 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.629
 get that icon that is in a 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.079
 call appears as an option 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.879
 sort of phone on the right side what 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.799
 you press and different options come 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.840
 for example I can call him I can 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.889
 I can put messages to him facetime 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.959
 I can email you in this case if 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.060
 here where it says college villarrica 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.769
 we can delete it and only put it in 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.769
 this case villarrica 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.629
 if we accept him and since there is 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.360
 finished he tells me he's going to send that 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.590
 mail I give you the option to create and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.290
 after I give you the option to create 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.690
 we give her create what she is going to do 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.060
 create this access in the middle part 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.090
 it tells you that you have to click it and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.349
 choose add on home screen now 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.819
 which tells you to add on home screen 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.159
 goals to put the name you give to 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.930
 add in this case you are going to create a 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.359
 icon 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.359
 loose we are going to move it here 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 and now when I press villarrica what 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.020
 what he's going to do is send me mail 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.450
 electronic so that I can send it 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.200
 then it really is a very good 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.030
 application which we can 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.640
 use to send to pages to 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.739
 call by phone to create emails 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.890
 electronic and for example I will give them 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.610
 an option let's create another icon I'll 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.940
 to give you contacts we are going to put you 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.480
 example 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.480
 here 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.289

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.270
 to pod and we will put for example 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.070
 I can reduce this drawing I can 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.440
 increase depending as I want 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.500

 since I did it I put it change I can 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.460
 change the name and give it create it creates 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.930
 I can save the icons for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.129

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.900

 I'm going to add and see they start to create 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.020
 icons the advantage is that you can 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.030
 save them in folders or subfolders 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.420

 it really is a good application has 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.050
 a cost of 12 pesos and it is very 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.260
