I<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:37.200> recommend<00:01:37.439> using<00:01:37.740> app<00:01:38.100> steps<00:01:38.900> even

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I don't recommend using app steps even

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590 
I don't recommend using app steps even
if<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.439> made<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> wood<00:01:40.950> art<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:42.390> better

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
if they are made of wood art it's better

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.910 
if they are made of wood art it's better
to<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.439> seating<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to actually do your seating with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
to actually do your seating with
something<00:01:44.250> else<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.840> guys<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
something else you see guys if you're

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
something else you see guys if you're
adding<00:01:46.770> torch<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.810> inside<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.990> home<00:01:49.229> or

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
adding torch at inside your home or

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.179 
adding torch at inside your home or
outside<00:01:49.890> your<00:01:50.280> home<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:51.200> I'm<00:01:52.200> always<00:01:52.649> trying

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
outside your home see I'm always trying

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
outside your home see I'm always trying
to<00:01:53.430> achieve<00:01:53.820> them<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.200> height<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to achieve them at the same height the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
to achieve them at the same height the
reason<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> end<00:01:58.439> up

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
reason for that is it's going to end up

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.880 
reason for that is it's going to end up
looking<00:01:59.009> better<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.329> talking<00:02:00.659> about

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
looking better I'm not talking about

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.679 
looking better I'm not talking about
exactly<00:02:01.890> i'll<00:02:02.159> always<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> second

exactly i'll always i can the second
block<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.549> if

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
block that's it but it's just if you if
