we're<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:14.610> today<00:00:15.859> to<00:00:16.859> tag<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.340> squid<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we're out here today to tag to squid and

we're out here today to tag to squid and
to<00:00:18.330> catch<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.750> lot<00:00:18.869> more<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.560> take<00:00:19.949> them<00:00:20.100> for

to catch a lot more and take them for
sampling<00:00:20.609> these<00:00:21.150> are<00:00:21.240> Humboldt<00:00:21.510> squid<00:00:21.630> which

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
sampling these are Humboldt squid which

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.200

are large large squid that historically

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
are large large squid that historically
have<00:00:27.359> lived<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.720> far<00:00:27.869> north<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.199> Mexico<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
have lived as far north as Mexico and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
have lived as far north as Mexico and
sort<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> periodically<00:00:30.179> moved<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.900> into

sort of periodically moved up into

sort of periodically moved up into
California<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.309> now<00:00:32.550> we've<00:00:33.420> seen<00:00:33.660> records<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
California but now we've seen records of

California but now we've seen records of
them<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.980> pretty<00:00:35.579> continuously<00:00:36.120> since<00:00:36.510> 1997

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
them here pretty continuously since 1997

them here pretty continuously since 1997
and<00:00:37.500> they're<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.829> further<00:00:38.160> north<00:00:38.399> than

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520

Oregon Washington British Columbia and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.410 
Oregon Washington British Columbia and
Alaska<00:00:43.129> when<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.219> pull<00:00:44.370> squad<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.910> put<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Alaska when we pull squad up we put it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
Alaska when we pull squad up we put it
into<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> cooler<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.920> full<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> sea<00:00:47.280> water

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
into a cooler that's full of sea water

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.010 
into a cooler that's full of sea water
so<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.270> wood<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> still<00:00:48.719> able<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so that this wood is still able to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
so that this wood is still able to
breathe<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.530> sort<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.340> calm<00:00:50.579> while<00:00:51.030> we're

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
breathe and sort of be calm while we're

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
breathe and sort of be calm while we're
tagging<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> tag<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> put

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
tagging it this is the tag that we put

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
tagging it this is the tag that we put
on<00:00:52.980> again<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.000> records<00:00:54.449> pressure<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
on again it records pressure and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.459 
on again it records pressure and
temperature<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
temperature we can then see as a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.110 
temperature we can then see as a
time-series<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.370> temperature<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> depth

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
time-series this temperature and depth

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
time-series this temperature and depth
and<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.690> where<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> squid<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.350> swimming<00:01:01.379> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and see where the squid is swimming in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.990 
and see where the squid is swimming in
the<00:01:01.829> water<00:01:01.980> column<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.370> how<00:01:02.460> deep<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the water column so how deep it is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
the water column so how deep it is
during<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.239> day<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.480> night<00:01:04.339> signals<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.489> the

during the day at night signals from the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
during the day at night signals from the
tags<00:01:05.880> will<00:01:06.330> hopefully<00:01:06.510> give<00:01:06.810> clues<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
tags will hopefully give clues about the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.210 
tags will hopefully give clues about the

squids migrations previous studies have

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
squids migrations previous studies have
