 itself and not Sloover 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.819
 so we are also from a period of 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.980
 a few seasons ago about cooler 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.459
 than ichinose such and and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.079

 and what are jeans trends for this 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.549
 autumn mine speaks very much of bite 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.350
 then came back a bit 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.100
 looser jeans I personally believe for that 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.519
 the ladies 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.370
 he got back in the boyfriend jeans 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.880
 skiing remains only if you really go through the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.590
 trends 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.269
 trend watchers look or touch themselves 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.980
 what will come but I want there 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.139
 personally not really into it 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.579
 maybe bye stays close numbers 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.959
 his family greenhouse to hang what has 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.630

 Anyway him stay and a whole 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 important trend and what I love super 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.140
 also likes the winter sometimes each and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 sim sim lines from 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 bleached there jeans 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.520
 in winter it is now slightly less 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 pale but on the see until there alone 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.170
 for example , red jeans only turned on 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.760
 the corridor is perhaps the la examples 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.490
 Yes and I am going to leave with pleasure 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.860
 super bowl where can we start 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.540
 maybe michiels for example one 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.120
 first model is this 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.890
 you look at a pretty pale and that is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.450
 a trend that we also see in the cream 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.980
 this winter 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.530
 usually with us as wendy scatters and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.790
 rubbing open the paris pears to there yes 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.840
 that is not always easy if you 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.050
 that does happen then is currently happening 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.360
 ict like purg'd water is that door and such 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.000
 he really realized that it is quite cold 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
 i look the week as i can feel 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.410
 so really jaap paauwe stretching and 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.000
 if customers are wearing a mango 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.170
 then they want nothing else in the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.420
 always be back 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.950
 the original form so how 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.989
 we get buy 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.280
 but apart from that , there is always growth 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.540
 its original form 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.130
 Charlie ran super cool where that 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.989
 actually a second skin like all 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.850
 say for the people who care less about that 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.010
 we have a variant 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.200
 See also pretty light for the winter 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.479
 personally find that super beautiful and become 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.880
 you can perfectly combine that with myths 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.530
 direction then also view photos 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.750
 on the internet and nowadays I have that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.520
 all so easy 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.380
 yes and then no stroking you can slightly higher 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.440
 start to wear blouse blush in it 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.540
 or that is certainly not a must but for the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.490
 fashionista's lower limit on yes even 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.680

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.890
 fashionistas there is the hinges week 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.910
 Jan 3 Monsieur Says yes and certainly 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.620
 year 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.210
 we are from a previous winter 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.200
 winter machine park awesome that this one 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.700

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.680
 at year celebrities will be one 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.720
 such a financially fun to 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.970
 combined with my I go a couple 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.370
 hack example that is a start with 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.260
 lacks macho form in combination with dan 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.300
 it obviously makes the short 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.220
 pervers child act 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.160
 yes another thing this whole winter 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.570
 rot something that is the pantsuit in jeans we 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.340
 actually thought of a summer for me too 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.410
 already sold very well 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.940
 we see beyoncÃ© performing in an egg 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.950
 you pack pants in jeans 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.290
 katy perry has worn the jeans dress 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.660
 so would have missed it too 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.620
 of course we are already trying at least 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.450
 mac 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.040
 it provided that it responds to the on the 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.750
 differences are nicer and there are 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.670
 is something else worn or racked 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.090
 can also be perfect and lasting about it 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.040
 and the pump and for ladies 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.110
 super nice dressed and then we go to 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.180
 yes the boyfriend 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.890
 I personally like to see the boyfriends 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.960
 that are feminine cut is therefore 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.060
 the most commercial to be there yes you see 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.760
 then those bags and the like it stays 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.190
 with a boyfriend jeans in terms of look but you 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.410
 do have feminine details and for the 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:54.320
 gentlemen then also have this for example 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.050
 nice washed that they are super steely 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.820
 also with stretchy mosfet yes yes yes all those 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.470
 Muscles for the gentlemen are his too 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.970
 my name is there is all brands make that 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.400
 now what the man's also been 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.990
 being closed stems from there nature and 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.970
 how narrow and pleasant it is to us 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.920
 instruction pants are but then it has 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.750
 way yes we both straits bike too 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.060
 get more my comics 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.710
 why forward straits were quite loose 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.200
 also known for all nowadays 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.120
 by magic men very much now too 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.820
 there often to take a corner that sometimes 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.230
 maybe more in line with the upper parts 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.520
 a good alternative for men who like 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.170
 strives for 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.230
 go smart or want to go narrower 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.670
 is that rule also with stretchy 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.680
 personally i'm just about steve 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.810
 if I put this model to that 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.390
 is for me the wide side 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.650
 just my bosses who don't sweat 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.780
 did not go there for me 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.760
 football small enough what should that be 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.560
 super nice for him to wear and 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.170
 So then he feels the growth 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.790
 listening to what the customer wins 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.830
 it will die on its own trends 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.570
 must try your own life 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.760
 Sometimes it is better to invest in one 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.520
 good jeans and good ones 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.320
 sentences absolute certainly yes to your jeans the 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.290

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.530

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.360
