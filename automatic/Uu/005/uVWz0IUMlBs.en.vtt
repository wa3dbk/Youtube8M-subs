four<00:06:01.370> two-out<00:06:01.669> hits<00:06:01.849> in<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:02.030> row<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.360> mean<00:06:02.570> that's

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
four two-out hits in a row I mean that's

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.600 
four two-out hits in a row I mean that's
pretty<00:06:02.870> impressive<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.830> feels<00:06:04.160> great<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:04.460> mean

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
pretty impressive it feels great I mean

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.700 
pretty impressive it feels great I mean
a<00:06:05.180> lot<00:06:05.570> of<00:06:05.660> confidence<00:06:05.960> going<00:06:06.139> to<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:06.470> game

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
a lot of confidence going to this game

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.409 
a lot of confidence going to this game
and<00:06:07.010> we<00:06:07.400> just<00:06:07.550> had<00:06:07.639> to<00:06:07.729> take<00:06:07.849> it<00:06:07.910> one<00:06:08.120> pitch<00:06:08.240> at

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
and we just had to take it one pitch at

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.520 
and we just had to take it one pitch at
a<00:06:08.479> time<00:06:09.700> we<00:06:10.700> took<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.940> kind<00:06:11.539> of<00:06:11.630> a<00:06:11.750> rough<00:06:12.289> start

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
a time we took a kind of a rough start

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.290 
a time we took a kind of a rough start
with<00:06:12.979> them<00:06:13.130> going<00:06:13.340> up<00:06:13.520> to<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:13.789> nothing<00:06:14.120> but

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
with them going up to the nothing but

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.870 
with them going up to the nothing but
you<00:06:15.110> know<00:06:15.229> what<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.010> hitters<00:06:16.220> we<00:06:16.340> have<00:06:16.520> in<00:06:16.760> the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
can go down at any point of the game and

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.589 
can go down at any point of the game and
come<00:06:21.680> back<00:06:21.830> and<00:06:22.039> win<00:06:22.190> approached<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.360> plates

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599
