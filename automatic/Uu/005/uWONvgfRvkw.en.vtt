kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.690> comparable<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> nature<00:00:37.860> box

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
kind of be comparable to nature box

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.119 
kind of be comparable to nature box

there are a lot of options that maybe

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
there are a lot of options that maybe
aren't<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.090> healthy<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.260> i'm<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.559> really

mean basically it's cashews and black
pepper<00:04:05.730> probably<00:04:06.730> won't<00:04:06.850> even<00:04:06.940> finish<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
pepper probably won't even finish the
