00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
internal branches that's what we're

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.430 
internal branches that's what we're
going<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.970> do<00:02:44.090> with<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.360> one<00:02:44.569> just<00:02:44.750> continue

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
going to do with this one just continue

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.250 
going to do with this one just continue
with<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.829> styling<00:02:49.750> are<00:02:50.750> going<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.049> be<00:02:51.140> looking

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
with the styling are going to be looking

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.280 
with the styling are going to be looking
at<00:02:51.650> placing<00:02:52.310> some<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.609> branches<00:02:53.170> when<00:02:54.170> we

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
at placing some of the branches when we

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.220 
at placing some of the branches when we
looking<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.590> bending<00:02:54.859> that<00:02:54.980> will<00:02:55.099> not<00:02:56.230> last

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
looking at bending that will not last

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.069 
looking at bending that will not last
long<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.650> what<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:57.920> said<00:02:58.129> I<00:02:58.840> think<00:02:59.840> so

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
long is that what you said I think so

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.069 
long is that what you said I think so
yeah<00:03:00.290> yeah<00:03:04.239> have<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.299> remind<00:03:05.659> you<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.840> what<00:03:05.930> I

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
yeah yeah have to remind you of what I

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.380 
yeah yeah have to remind you of what I
say<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.409> all<00:03:06.440> these<00:03:06.709> two<00:03:06.859> all<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.190> time<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.550 

that's<00:03:11.390> what<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> little<00:03:12.109> bit<00:03:12.200> more<00:03:12.319> growth

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
that's what a little bit more growth

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.319 
that's what a little bit more growth
looking<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> bit<00:03:13.010> healthier<00:03:13.310> go<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.180> we're

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
looking a bit healthier go so we're

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.809 
looking a bit healthier go so we're
going<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.540> custom<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.989> up<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.790> remember<00:03:17.209> I

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
going to custom it up and you remember I

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.839 
going to custom it up and you remember I
came<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.090> minaret<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:21.889> wired<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.310> other<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
came the minaret you wired the other the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.120 
came the minaret you wired the other the
other<00:03:22.910> part<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.419> trunk<00:03:23.630> ride<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:25.099> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
other part of the trunk ride on to the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.490 
other part of the trunk ride on to the
strip<00:03:26.060> trunk<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.750> did<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.169> brought<00:03:27.349> it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
strip trunk so you did so you brought it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.379 
strip trunk so you did so you brought it
right<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.130> wasn't<00:03:28.370> wired<00:03:28.519> up<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.150> bit

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
right but it wasn't wired up this bit

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.710 
right but it wasn't wired up this bit
yeah<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.230> was<00:03:30.410> wired<00:03:30.620> right<00:03:31.209> okay<00:03:32.209> I'll<00:03:32.480> just

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
yeah that was wired right okay I'll just

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680 
yeah that was wired right okay I'll just
start<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.530> one<00:03:33.739> bronze<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.209> was<00:03:35.359> I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
start the one bronze just that was I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.809 
start the one bronze just that was I
wired<00:03:36.079> or<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.410> other<00:03:36.560> stripped<00:03:37.129> Trump<00:03:37.579> there

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
wired or the other stripped Trump there

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.909 
wired or the other stripped Trump there
at<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> back<00:03:39.579> tighten<00:03:40.579> join<00:03:40.730> that<00:03:40.910> way<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:41.299> I

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
at the back tighten join that way but I

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.030 
at the back tighten join that way but I
think<00:03:42.919> I<00:03:43.010> was<00:03:43.099> as<00:03:43.280> far<00:03:43.519> as<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.730> wiring<00:03:44.090> went

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
think I was as far as the wiring went

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.230 
think I was as far as the wiring went
did<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.129> know<00:03:46.220> why<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.400> take<00:03:46.790> me<00:03:46.940> there

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:06.220 

you're<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.270> later<00:03:53.569> time<00:04:01.480> you're<00:04:02.480> all<00:04:05.230> everybody

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
you're a later time you're all everybody

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.600 
you're a later time you're all everybody
like<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.680> before<00:04:06.800> enough<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.280> shop<00:04:07.459> smart

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
like that before enough to shop smart

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.430 
like that before enough to shop smart
I'm<00:04:08.030> sure<00:04:08.300> she'll<00:04:08.569> organized<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.080> spit<00:04:09.319> blood

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
I'm sure she'll organized to spit blood

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.190 
I'm sure she'll organized to spit blood
yeah<00:04:09.800> yes<00:04:10.690> Mike<00:04:11.690> there<00:04:11.870> are<00:04:11.989> no<00:04:12.170> screams<00:04:13.000> yeah

yeah<00:04:18.200> where's<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.530> projection<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
yeah where's a projection you get the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.629 
yeah where's a projection you get the
mouth<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:20.350> on<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.410> computer<00:04:21.650> under<00:04:22.490> them

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
mouth on it on the computer under them

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.940 
mouth on it on the computer under them
ha<00:04:22.820> makes<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:25.120> number<00:04:26.120> already<00:04:26.180> done<00:04:26.450> last<00:04:26.950> all

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
ha makes a number already done last all

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.110 
ha makes a number already done last all
right<00:04:28.370> i'll<00:04:29.330> be<00:04:29.479> attending<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:30.169> look<00:04:30.500> at<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
right i'll be attending just look at the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.180 
right i'll be attending just look at the
first<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.570> all<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.020> wirings<00:04:33.590> pulling<00:04:34.130> this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
first of all the wirings pulling this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.290 
first of all the wirings pulling this
bright<00:04:34.430> back<00:04:34.669> because<00:04:34.880> this<00:04:34.970> is<00:04:35.150> clearly

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
bright back because this is clearly

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.180 
bright back because this is clearly
going<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.660> be<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> background<00:04:36.260> that's<00:04:37.040> what

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
going to be the background that's what

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.629 
going to be the background that's what
we<00:04:37.280> were<00:04:37.430> doing<00:04:38.419> last<00:04:38.570> time<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.889> she's<00:04:40.160> pulling

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
we were doing last time so she's pulling

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.420 
we were doing last time so she's pulling
this<00:04:40.700> from<00:04:40.910> back<00:04:41.240> again<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:45.110> start<00:04:45.950> by<00:04:46.190> won't

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
this from back again so start by won't

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.200 
this from back again so start by won't
scratch<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.690> here<00:04:47.930> get<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:48.470> poor<00:04:48.740> world<00:04:49.210> then

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
scratch on here get that poor world then

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.490 
scratch on here get that poor world then
once<00:04:50.360> we've<00:04:50.510> got<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.660> position<00:04:51.169> just<00:04:51.350> going

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
once we've got that position just going

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.870 
once we've got that position just going
to<00:04:51.560> give<00:04:51.680> us<00:04:51.800> an<00:04:51.860> idea<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.220> how<00:04:52.400> much<00:04:52.550> we<00:04:52.760> need

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
to give us an idea of how much we need

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.940 
to give us an idea of how much we need
to<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:54.710> get<00:04:54.860> this<00:04:55.300> section<00:04:56.320> up<00:04:58.000> across<00:04:59.950> let's

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
to to get this section up across let's

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.490 
to to get this section up across let's
start<00:05:01.789> by<00:05:02.000> doing<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:06.380> then<00:05:06.560> see<00:05:06.770> you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
start by doing that and then see you

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.100 
start by doing that and then see you
okay<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:09.910> we<00:05:10.910> all<00:05:11.090> really<00:05:11.479> really<00:05:11.630> all<00:05:11.990> you

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
okay so we all really really all you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.680 
okay so we all really really all you
really<00:05:12.289> need<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.650> do<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:13.100> why<00:05:13.250> these<00:05:13.310> two

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
really need to do is to why these two

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.180 
really need to do is to why these two
two<00:05:14.690> branches<00:05:15.080> together<00:05:15.260> me<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.800> know<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
two branches together me you know the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.120 
two branches together me you know the
main<00:05:16.400> branches<00:05:16.760> together<00:05:16.940> there<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:21.680> above<00:05:21.950> it

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
main branches together there to above it

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.310 
main branches together there to above it
and<00:05:22.220> then<00:05:22.370> we<00:05:22.460> can<00:05:22.610> pull<00:05:22.820> this<00:05:22.940> round<00:05:23.210> again<00:05:23.510> it

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.000 
place I still try to keep going on think
the<00:05:59.750> only<00:05:59.870> took<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.229> so<00:06:00.409> far<00:06:00.680> because<00:06:00.890> the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
the only took it so far because the

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.990 
the only took it so far because the
trunk<00:06:01.370> split<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:02.030> then

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
trunk split and then

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.410 
trunk split and then
we<00:06:03.540> seal<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.190> left<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.340> like<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.390> I

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
we seal it and left it like that so I

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.790 
we seal it and left it like that so I
don't<00:06:06.630> think<00:06:06.750> we<00:06:06.840> managed<00:06:07.200> to<00:06:07.230> move<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.620> back

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800
