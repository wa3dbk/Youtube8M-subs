00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
fast I think we move on a bit after two

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950 
fast I think we move on a bit after two

then<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.009> move<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.119> second<00:02:06.479> think

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
then we move on to in a second think

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.469 
then we move on to in a second think
it's<00:02:06.810> shooting<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> app<00:02:09.179> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it's shooting do we go on to the app we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's shooting do we go on to the app we
do<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.110> overall<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> shooting<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.819> was

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
do and overall the shooting it was

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.619 
do and overall the shooting it was
average<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.439> nothing<00:02:14.629> absolutely

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
average it was nothing absolutely

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.339 
average it was nothing absolutely
amazing<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> unit<00:02:16.500> expects<00:02:16.829> of<00:02:17.099> him<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.939> was

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
amazing the unit expects of him it was

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.940 
amazing the unit expects of him it was
probably<00:02:19.349> just<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.799> bit

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
probably just a but not the a little bit

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.559 
probably just a but not the a little bit
better<00:02:23.099> than<00:02:23.430> his<00:02:23.579> normal<00:02:23.760> cat<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> didn't

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
better than his normal cat I didn't

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.289 
better than his normal cat I didn't
notice<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.930> huge<00:02:25.200> improvement<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.849> then<00:02:27.000> it's

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
notice a huge improvement but then it's

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.449 
notice a huge improvement but then it's
still<00:02:27.360> nice<00:02:27.720> when<00:02:27.989> using<00:02:28.319> him<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:29.099> was<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> nice

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
still nice when using him it was a nice

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.500 
still nice when using him it was a nice
wing<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.420> could<00:02:30.599> actually<00:02:30.659> shoot<00:02:31.400> but

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
wing one that could actually shoot but

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.789 
wing one that could actually shoot but
nothing<00:02:33.510> absolutely<00:02:34.049> amazing<00:02:34.379> control

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
nothing absolutely amazing control

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.039 
nothing absolutely amazing control
amazing<00:02:35.519> lon<00:02:35.700> shots<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.239> things<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.840> I

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
amazing lon shots are things like that I

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.690 
amazing lon shots are things like that I
did<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> slight<00:02:38.099> problem<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.549> his

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
did have a slight problem with his

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.130 
did have a slight problem with his
attacking<00:02:39.000> position<00:02:39.540> sometimes<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:40.109> well

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
attacking position sometimes as well

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.410 
attacking position sometimes as well
sometimes<00:02:40.680> he<00:02:40.799> seems<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.069> be<00:02:41.129> playing<00:02:41.420> center

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
sometimes he seems to be playing center

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.569 
sometimes he seems to be playing center
midfield<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:43.200> when<00:02:43.739> he<00:02:43.829> was<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.040> his<00:02:44.069> wing<00:02:44.370> he

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
midfield are when he was on his wing he

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.250 
midfield are when he was on his wing he
wouldn't<00:02:44.819> make<00:02:44.970> runs<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.659> kind<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.870> stand

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
wouldn't make runs it just kind of stand

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.170 
wouldn't make runs it just kind of stand
there<00:02:46.560> he<00:02:47.010> wouldn't<00:02:47.250> run<00:02:47.340> onto<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.670> ball<00:02:47.940> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
there he wouldn't run onto the ball that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.990 
there he wouldn't run onto the ball that
was<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.299> bit<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.599> issue<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:49.079> using<00:02:49.409> him<00:02:49.530> for

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
was a bit of an issue when using him for

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.190 
was a bit of an issue when using him for
getting<00:02:51.000> into<00:02:51.299> shooting<00:02:51.569> positions<00:02:52.049> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
getting into shooting positions and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.430 
getting into shooting positions and
things<00:02:52.639> obviously<00:02:53.639> is<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> five-star<00:02:54.750> skillet

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
things obviously is a five-star skillet

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.800 
things obviously is a five-star skillet
which<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.889> useful<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.060> amazing<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.599> don't

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
which is a useful and amazing I don't

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.569 
which is a useful and amazing I don't
think<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.049> include<00:02:58.319> many<00:02:58.560> skill<00:02:58.980> goals<00:02:59.280> are

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
think I include many skill goals are

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.569 
think I include many skill goals are
clips<00:02:59.879> in<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.409> but<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.620> obviously<00:03:02.400> it's

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
clips in this but and obviously it's

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.550 
clips in this but and obviously it's
really<00:03:02.909> useful<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.299> using<00:03:03.629> him<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.319> force

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
really useful and using him just force

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.530 
really useful and using him just force
killing<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.220> out<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.670> five<00:03:05.940> stars<00:03:06.269> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
killing it out with this five stars you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.660 
killing it out with this five stars you
can<00:03:06.690> stick<00:03:06.989> him<00:03:07.109> in<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.319> skill<00:03:07.620> squad<00:03:07.920> for

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
can stick him in your skill squad for

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.069 
can stick him in your skill squad for
any<00:03:08.790> people<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.359> make<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.720> goals

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
any people that do make like goals

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.259 
any people that do make like goals
compilations<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:10.950> things<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
compilations and things like that that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.420 
compilations and things like that that
was<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:12.510> okay<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.049> Lacey<00:03:13.530> earlier<00:03:13.920> skills<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
was an okay go Lacey earlier skills that

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.309 
was an okay go Lacey earlier skills that
you<00:03:14.519> could<00:03:14.639> do<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:15.150> nice<00:03:15.810> chopped<00:03:16.139> into

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
you could do and then nice chopped into

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.069 
you could do and then nice chopped into
finesse<00:03:16.739> shot<00:03:16.769> which<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.280> okay<00:03:17.639> so<00:03:18.449> skills

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
finesse shot which is okay so skills

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.710 
finesse shot which is okay so skills
definitely<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:20.190> massive<00:03:20.790> plus<00:03:21.060> side<00:03:21.329> form

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
definitely is a massive plus side form

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800 
definitely is a massive plus side form
and<00:03:22.129> that<00:03:23.129> would<00:03:23.459> make<00:03:23.639> him<00:03:23.849> over<00:03:24.569> it's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and that would make him over it's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.420 
and that would make him over it's
probably<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.139> lot<00:03:25.349> better<00:03:25.590> than<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.010> likes<00:03:26.190> of

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
probably a lot better than the likes of

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.339 
probably a lot better than the likes of
urban<00:03:26.879> are<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.419> five-star<00:03:27.870> skill<00:03:28.109> moves

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
urban are for this five-star skill moves

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.020 
urban are for this five-star skill moves
and<00:03:28.560> natural<00:03:29.040> pace<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.519> everything<00:03:29.879> like

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and natural pace and everything like

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.650 
and natural pace and everything like
that<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.449> that's<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.500> nice<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.980> useful<00:03:32.129> of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
that so that's really nice and useful of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.720 
that so that's really nice and useful of
as<00:03:33.660> well<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.139> is<00:03:34.290> heading<00:03:34.829> which<00:03:35.160> we<00:03:35.370> don't

as well as is heading which we don't
make<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> manufacturing<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.079> but<00:03:37.799> his

headings not and not the greatest it's

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.369 
headings not and not the greatest it's

you but whenever he does get a header is
a<00:03:48.359> bit<00:03:48.629> like<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.959> messy<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.730> kind<00:03:50.940> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a bit like a messy that just kind of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
a bit like a messy that just kind of
heads<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> player<00:03:52.109> odd<00:03:52.440> doesn't<00:03:52.949> win

the<00:03:53.699> header<00:03:54.199> finally<00:03:55.199> it's<00:03:55.409> his<00:03:55.590> strength<00:03:55.919> and

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159
