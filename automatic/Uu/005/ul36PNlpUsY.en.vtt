00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
little trusty computer and it works

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.640 
little trusty computer and it works
pretty<00:02:16.510> well<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.049> looked<00:02:17.230> at<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> weather

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
and our weather conditions are as bad as

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.440 
and our weather conditions are as bad as
they<00:03:11.829> can<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:12.159> hot<00:03:12.459> northerly<00:03:12.909> winds<00:03:13.120> low
