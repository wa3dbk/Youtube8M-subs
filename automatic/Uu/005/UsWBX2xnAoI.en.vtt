the<00:01:41.439> big<00:01:41.560> jumps<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:42.520> soaked<00:01:43.240> all<00:01:43.390> those<00:01:43.569> up<00:01:43.780> with

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
the big jumps I soaked all those up with

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.840 
the big jumps I soaked all those up with
aplomb<00:01:44.170> felt<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.829> was<00:01:44.979> endless<00:01:45.369> travel

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
aplomb felt like it was endless travel

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.209 
aplomb felt like it was endless travel
but<00:01:46.030> didn't<00:01:46.659> Bob<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.140> didn't<00:01:47.500> get<00:01:47.770> stuck<00:01:48.039> down

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
but didn't Bob but didn't get stuck down

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.649 
but didn't Bob but didn't get stuck down
in<00:01:48.280> its<00:01:48.579> travel<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.119> worked<00:01:49.390> really<00:01:49.479> well

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
in its travel and worked really well

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.359 
in its travel and worked really well
because<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.350> terrain<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.100> were<00:01:51.189> riding

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
because of the terrain we were riding

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.950 
because of the terrain we were riding
today<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.789> set<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.149> minnow<00:01:52.390> link<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
today I set the minnow link in the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.809 
today I set the minnow link in the
slacker<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.950> lower<00:01:54.159> bottom<00:01:54.520> bracket

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
slacker and the lower bottom bracket

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.990 
slacker and the lower bottom bracket
position<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:56.470> gave<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.860> bike<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.099> slightly

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
position just gave the bike a slightly

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.789 
position just gave the bike a slightly
better<00:01:58.179> feel<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> high<00:01:58.840> speed<00:01:59.110> stuff<00:01:59.439> I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
better feel with the high speed stuff I

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.279 
better feel with the high speed stuff I
just<00:02:00.159> made<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.459> little<00:02:00.549> bit<00:02:00.759> more<00:02:00.909> stable

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
just made it a little bit more stable

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.050 
just made it a little bit more stable
but<00:02:02.289> I<00:02:02.590> think<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.069> would<00:02:03.220> quite<00:02:03.399> capable<00:02:03.880> of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
but I think it would quite capable of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.880 
but I think it would quite capable of
turning<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.079> into<00:02:05.200> more<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.649> trial

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
turning it into more of a trial

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.679 
turning it into more of a trial
orientated<00:02:06.640> bike<00:02:06.789> if<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.179> flip<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.420> over

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
orientated bike if you just flip it over

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.289 
orientated bike if you just flip it over
and<00:02:07.989> set<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.709> in<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:08.920> more<00:02:09.069> trial<00:02:09.369> setting<00:02:10.060> it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
and set it in the more trial setting it

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.300 
and set it in the more trial setting it
worked<00:02:11.049> quite<00:02:11.230> well<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.920> really<00:02:12.190> nice

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
worked quite well one of the really nice

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.949 
worked quite well one of the really nice
features<00:02:12.370> just<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.299> simple<00:02:13.450> thing<00:02:13.660> was

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
features just a really simple thing was

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.479 
features just a really simple thing was

really stable through the air which was

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.009 
really stable through the air which was
good<00:02:36.040> took<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.489> couple<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.910> big<00:02:37.090> lines<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:37.900> it

up<00:02:42.010> short<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.489> anything<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.850> think<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.359> got<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
up short or anything I think it's got a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.870 
up short or anything I think it's got a
really<00:02:43.900> solid<00:02:44.109> build<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:44.799> it's<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.579> really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
really solid build but it's a really

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.280 
really solid build but it's a really
lightweight<00:02:46.090> buy<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.720> what<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.200> what

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290

did great hit some of the drops and gaps

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.589 
did great hit some of the drops and gaps
without<00:03:18.879> a<00:03:18.970> problem<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:21.459> light<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.360> end

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
without a problem really light back end

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.420 
without a problem really light back end
on<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> was<00:03:23.049> actually<00:03:23.620> surprised<00:03:23.980> how<00:03:24.099> well

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
on it I was actually surprised how well

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.319 
on it I was actually surprised how well
the<00:03:25.180> active<00:03:25.900> braking<00:03:26.140> pivot<00:03:26.680> works<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.370> such

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
the active braking pivot works and such

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.640 
the active braking pivot works and such
a<00:03:28.359> light<00:03:28.599> back<00:03:28.780> end<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.109> really<00:03:29.260> helped<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
a light back end it really helped the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.349 
a light back end it really helped the
track<00:03:29.920> through<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.579> radio<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.090> rougher

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
track through the radio and rougher

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.030 
track through the radio and rougher
stuff<00:03:31.599> this<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.200> actually<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.590> first<00:03:32.769> chance

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
stuff this is actually the first chance

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.470 
stuff this is actually the first chance
that<00:03:33.220> had<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.459> dry<00:03:33.609> ride<00:03:33.970> one<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.299> bikes

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that had to dry ride one of the bikes

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.199 
that had to dry ride one of the bikes
with<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> 50<00:03:35.230> ml<00:03:35.500> through<00:03:35.709> axle<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.280> it's

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
with a 50 ml through axle and it's

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.240 
with a 50 ml through axle and it's
really<00:03:37.810> stiff<00:03:38.019> at<00:03:38.200> all<00:03:38.349> -<00:03:38.709> feels<00:03:39.010> like<00:03:39.159> you've

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
really stiff at all - feels like you've

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.649 
really stiff at all - feels like you've
got<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> 20<00:03:39.700> mil<00:03:39.819> through<00:03:40.000> axle<00:03:40.329> up<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.569> the

on this which once again just skippers

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.530 
on this which once again just skippers
up<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.980> whole<00:03:45.129> front<00:03:45.310> ends<00:03:45.670> you're<00:03:46.269> really

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
up the whole front ends you're really

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.819 
up the whole front ends you're really
even<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:46.870> you're<00:03:46.989> pushing<00:03:47.200> into<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.470> corner<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
even if you're pushing into a corner and

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.920 
even if you're pushing into a corner and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
turning the bars you don't feel it you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.360 
turning the bars you don't feel it you
give<00:03:50.200> with<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.530> front<00:03:50.769> end<00:03:50.889> of<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.010> bike<00:03:51.099> it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
give with the front end of the bike it

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.520 
give with the front end of the bike it
just<00:03:51.549> goes<00:03:52.000> where<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.269> want<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.989> really

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
just goes where you want it to I really

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.890 
just goes where you want it to I really
like<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.739> bike<00:03:53.920> with<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.220> DRC<00:03:54.849> v<00:03:55.239> suspension

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
like the bike with the DRC v suspension

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.050 
like the bike with the DRC v suspension
easy<00:03:56.709> change<00:03:57.159> between<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.639> three<00:03:57.849> modes

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
easy change between the three modes

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.140 
easy change between the three modes
between<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.750> scent<00:03:58.989> trail<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.920> climb<00:04:00.159> I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
between the scent trail and climb I

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.140 
between the scent trail and climb I
really<00:04:01.989> did<00:04:02.230> handle<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.769> small<00:04:03.519> chatter<00:04:03.879> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
really did handle the small chatter and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.960 
really did handle the small chatter and
bump<00:04:04.359> quite<00:04:04.690> well<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.230> without<00:04:06.220> any<00:04:06.430> loss<00:04:06.730> to

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
bump quite well and without any loss to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.670 
bump quite well and without any loss to
actually<00:04:07.299> taking<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.810> bigger<00:04:07.989> hits<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
actually taking the bigger hits and I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680 
actually taking the bigger hits and I
think<00:04:09.190> for<00:04:09.400> an<00:04:09.489> all<00:04:09.579> day<00:04:09.760> try<00:04:10.060> right<00:04:10.329> even

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
think for an all day try right even

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.229 
think for an all day try right even
cross-country<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.829> really<00:04:12.519> go<00:04:12.669> with<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.000> feel

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
cross-country I really go with the feel

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.300 
cross-country I really go with the feel

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the exhale that's just a great little

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.509 
the exhale that's just a great little
