00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.560 
barriers to make this happen what's been
frustrating<00:00:28.760> we've<00:00:28.880> been<00:00:29.030> at<00:00:29.180> that<00:00:29.300> point

frustrating we've been at that point

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.709 
frustrating we've been at that point
actually<00:00:29.750> for<00:00:30.050> five<00:00:30.230> years<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:31.430> why<00:00:32.329> is<00:00:32.390> this

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
actually for five years so why is this

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.599 
actually for five years so why is this
not<00:00:32.960> happening<00:00:33.590> why<00:00:33.770> are<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.219> still<00:00:34.399> getting

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:34.609 
not happening why are we still getting

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.620 
not happening why are we still getting
these<00:00:34.850> terrible<00:00:35.510> outcomes<00:00:36.170> higher<00:00:36.890> cost

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
these terrible outcomes higher cost

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.310 
these terrible outcomes higher cost
terrible<00:00:38.630> access<00:00:39.550> as<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.030> mentioned

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
terrible access as you just mentioned

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.229 
terrible access as you just mentioned
with<00:00:42.320> really<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:43.370> poorest<00:00:43.670> for<00:00:43.910> some<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
with really the poorest for some of the

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.220 
with really the poorest for some of the
first<00:00:44.420> outcomes<00:00:44.960> on<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.230> planet<00:00:46.960> so<00:00:47.960> when<00:00:48.140> you

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
first outcomes on the planet so when you

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.200 
first outcomes on the planet so when you
analyze<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.250> issue<00:00:50.230> what<00:00:51.230> are<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.530> barriers

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
analyze this issue what are the barriers

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.770 
analyze this issue what are the barriers
so<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.020> take<00:00:54.200> medicine<00:00:55.129> as<00:00:55.460> three<00:00:56.360> buckets

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
so if you take medicine as three buckets

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.000 
so if you take medicine as three buckets
the<00:00:56.960> first<00:00:57.230> barriers<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.800> knowledge

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the first barriers this knowledge

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.490 
the first barriers this knowledge
barrier<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.750> knowledge<00:00:59.960> barriers

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
barrier and the knowledge barriers

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.060 
barrier and the knowledge barriers
exploding<00:01:01.190> every<00:01:01.489> day<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:03.289> second<00:01:03.680> barrier

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
exploding every day the second barrier

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.130 
exploding every day the second barrier
is<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.460> delivery<00:01:04.909> barrier<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.960> third

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
is the delivery barrier and the third

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.680 
is the delivery barrier and the third
barrier<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.009> payment<00:01:07.219> barrier<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.479> let's

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
barrier is the payment barrier so let's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.330 
barrier is the payment barrier so let's
just<00:01:08.900> deliver<00:01:09.440> as<00:01:09.619> in<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> healthcare

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
just deliver as in the healthcare

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.719 
just deliver as in the healthcare
provider<00:01:10.700> correct<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.659> terms<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:12.400> how<00:01:13.400> does
