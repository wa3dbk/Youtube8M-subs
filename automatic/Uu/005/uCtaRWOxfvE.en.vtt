00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.140
 perez asks hello jose already makes a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 time I'm subscribed to your channel and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.990
 I see all your videos 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 I want to start myself in the world of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 aquariums and I have more or less clear 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 an idea of ​​how my aquarium is going to be and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 the fish that I am going to put my question is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 You can use rainwater to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 put it in the fish tank depends on where 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 live rain water may be 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 quite dirty and polluted for 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.880
 aquarium fish unless you live in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 the field you just have to collect water from 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 rain from a bucket and you'll see that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 surely not so clean of all 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.480
 I repeat that although it is not bad water 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.829
 for the river fish if it can be 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.559
 deadly for aquarium fish 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.840
 mohamed asks hello to someone can you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.690
 finally answer how many fish maximum 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.309
 I can have in a 100-liter aquarium 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.649
 I have four scalars five nuns 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 four cherry neon a runner and a 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 clean crystals my question is can I 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 put ten boats is possible or not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 thank you and answer finally I have a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.000
 I doubt I have a community aquarium of 100 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.859
 liters and it gets dirty right away you cry 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 unplugged the water treatment plant when 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.520
 eat but after a month I have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 that change all the water clean the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 stone this mushroom or that green that I do not know 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.940
 what is it called but it costs of the twine 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 answer because the rule is important 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 is one or two liters per centimeter 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 of fish but in practice in 100 liters 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 we can only have 3 or 4 scalars 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 and with the rest of the fish that you already have 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 there is some overcrowding meter 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 Barbosa currently enters guard is 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 impossible unless it was only 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.860
 for them because they are very active and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.660
 They need to be in a group to have 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 clean the web of your aquarium you should not 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.530
 unplug the filter and yes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 you should make weekly water changes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.729
 of 40 percent for your case never the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 change totally to lower it green 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.300
 should this have a maximum of 7 hours 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 day of light and if you have already cleaned 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.450
 with the water changes that I mentioned to you 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.660
 before the problem should be solved 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.610
 epic question hello good I have a 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.800
 golpismo and pequeñito and a small comet 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.530
 but bigger than golf and if in a 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.970
 60 liter aquarium fish is me cold 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.160
 almost always at the bottom of the aquarium 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 It is a little swollen and also has the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.080
 fins a little spoiled because of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 that the comet chases and nibbles 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.070
 stop the comet but it hits 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.710
 only in the other aquarium that displaces my 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.660
 times thanks in advance the problem 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.760
 main is that they would need 100 liters 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.630
 for both if you can not go I recommend you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.700
 give some 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.440
 although in the long run only one is also going to 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.940
 need 100 liters or more too 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 you must know that for the fish that is 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.350
 you should make water changes 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 of 20% every two or three days until 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.100
 the fish recovers 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.900
 gerardo question very good afternoon I have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.000
 a question I hope you can answer me 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.860
 I have an aquarium of 40 liters and I have 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.690
 three times only in it with his 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 booking a bowl and butter and a play 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.440
 with mantaraya what happens is that the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.510
 shooting pursues a lot when you die that you 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.010
 can do in this case the ideal would be 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.650
 remove the fish goal and put it in a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.180
 aquarium of 100 liters or give it and leave the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 40 liter aquarium for the mill 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.120
 let's say that out of these options there 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.030
 there would be another solution 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.250
 Isaane throne with your question hello sir 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.380
 aquarium and happy year I wanted to do 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.870
 some questions I have an aquarium of 180 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.270
 liters with 4 cebritas 3 guppies two 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 albino runners and two scalars my 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.780
 problem is that I got algae 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.940
 green on the plants and elsewhere 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.410
 they told me that the problem was due to 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.260
 that the aquarium got a lot of light 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.060
 solar and that gave them a lot of food I've 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.860
 changed where it does not give the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.530
 sunlight and I have lowered the amount of 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.300
 food 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.819
 but now I have colored algae 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.950
 coffee what will I be on how can I 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.930
 solve it will be good to buy some 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.670
 fish eat seaweed can you recommend me 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.069
 one that is compatible with my fish 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.709
 thanks in advance and my question 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.760
 jose I have a question before I had the 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.319
 very ugly aquarium 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.300
 I'm just telling you that I had an ugly plant and 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.360
 but now the aquarium is nicer 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.920
 he passes us a photos it may seem that 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.660
 they have overpopulation but the lord 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.360
 where he bought the plants he told me that the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.310
 they will treat you well takes more than 20 years 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.050
 working in aquariums and animals the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.730
 problem is that I put co2 and the 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.590
 plants thank you but the algae 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.080
 I also dating and piles 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.910
 I put the ancestors a zebra snail and 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.709
 some little snails 'squat' that 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.180
 it brought one of the plants and one quality 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.190
 now but not with those and clean the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 background stones told me what the 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.430
 back to the bottom stones so that 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.560
 the algae die but I get out by the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.300
 another side there is a fish that is not the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.980
 litigation that can clean me better or with 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.900
 more efficiency I could do to 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.000
 improve the aquarium would be able to put 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.400
 good the beans thanks and greetings in 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.590
 both questions it would be good to lower the 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.209
 light hours to six or seven every day if 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.660
 it is possible to remove the algae manually 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.000
 and keep the changes 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.190
 weekly waters of 20 30 or 40 by 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.170
 cent although in the case of co2 it will be 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.670
 more difficult to eradicate algae 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.620
 I could try paying with 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.270
 macronutrients although the beans do not 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.980
 they will need anyway and as 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.990
 last option there are fish that feed 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.480
 very good of these algae for both cases 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.190
 the best pets would be the other 5 use finish 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.120
 that is a pretty little fish and 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.670
 peaceful 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.860
 David asks very good year have you 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.870
 Mr. Jose could clarify some 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.120
 knees that I have please is good 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.590
 always tell the wolves what 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.230
 type of vegetables I can give to my 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.060
 golfers in advance thank you very much yes 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.010
 are worms taken directly from the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.840
 street are not recommended unless 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.970
 the things of the field with which you yourself 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.980
 At the time of garcé, it is better to chop 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.840
 those that are small to avoid 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.700
 intestinal constructions in terms of 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.220
 vegetables you can give them of all kinds that 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.220
 have at home just go see them 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.800
 and peel them iratxe question good I just 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.240
 to have about 35-40 baby guti and the 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.400
 I have in the paridera that I 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.500
 Would you recommend taking them out or leaving them for a month? 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.210
 until they grow up a little bit I'm 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.370
 giving food in well crushed flakes 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.150
 but different types that could more you 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.850
 give 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.670
 for your videos and happy 2014 and how 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.290
 we say here urte berri on 2014 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.570
 If you do not have several others where to put them 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.920
 better leave them where they are or put them 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.840
 in another container that is larger 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.460
 but inside the aquarium the feeding 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.350
 It should be alive if you want it to be 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.330
 put your best and if you can not 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.220
 to be at least should give them food 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.320
 frozen well chopped so they can 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.120
 eat and apart you can mix food 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.550
 special for fry with vegetables 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.410
 all this will make them improve a lot good 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.030
 you finish this has been everything I will try 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.690
