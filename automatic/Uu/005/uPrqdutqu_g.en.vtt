Quetzalcoatlus okay so it is a very very
hard<00:00:29.179> to<00:00:29.240> find<00:00:29.449> figure<00:00:29.810> if<00:00:30.710> you<00:00:30.920> go<00:00:31.099> for<00:00:31.400> up<00:00:31.580> to

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
hard to find figure if you go for up to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.020 
hard to find figure if you go for up to
like<00:00:32.029> you<00:00:32.720> just<00:00:33.680> noose<00:00:34.040> like<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:34.550> for<00:00:34.790> about

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
like you just noose like this for about

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.840 
like you just noose like this for about
$40<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:37.870> in<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.019> working<00:00:39.410> like<00:00:40.010> 140<00:00:40.580> dollars

$40 and in the working like 140 dollars

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.869 
$40 and in the working like 140 dollars
I<00:00:41.239> believe<00:00:41.589> go<00:00:42.589> for<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:42.890> high<00:00:43.100> go<00:00:43.519> for<00:00:43.699> higher

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
I believe go for that high go for higher

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.400 
I believe go for that high go for higher
than<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.300> but<00:00:44.510> that's<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.839> normal<00:00:44.989> price

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
than that but that's the normal price

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.790 
than that but that's the normal price

but uh excuse me I still have a little

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.100 
but uh excuse me I still have a little
bit<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.129> cool<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.730> being<00:00:49.879> shot<00:00:50.210> very

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
bit of the cool this is being shot very

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.540 
bit of the cool this is being shot very
shortly<00:00:51.710> after<00:00:51.920> my<00:00:52.370> last<00:00:52.550> review<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:55.100> this

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
shortly after my last review but this

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.439 
shortly after my last review but this
this<00:00:56.090> guy<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.629> uh<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.309> very<00:00:58.579> rare<00:00:59.120> figure

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
this guy is uh is a very rare figure

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.840 
this guy is uh is a very rare figure
because<00:00:59.840> of<00:01:00.379> course<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.710> series<00:01:01.039> 2<00:01:01.219> is<00:01:01.370> not<00:01:01.550> as

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
because of course the series 2 is not as

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.060 
because of course the series 2 is not as
heavily<00:01:02.420> produced<00:01:02.719> as<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> dress<00:01:03.680> sparks

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
heavily produced as the dress sparks

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.580 
heavily produced as the dress sparks
there<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:04.840> Austin<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.960> sales<00:01:06.200> were<00:01:06.440> done

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
there is one Austin the sales were done

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.210 
there is one Austin the sales were done
a<00:01:06.710> lot<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.930> has<00:01:09.140> made<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.590> very<00:01:09.619> hard<00:01:10.070> to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
a lot and it has made it very hard to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.219 
a lot and it has made it very hard to
find<00:01:10.460> it's<00:01:10.729> also<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:11.030> very<00:01:11.210> breakable<00:01:11.630> figure

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
find it's also a very breakable figure

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.380 
find it's also a very breakable figure
so<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.770> know<00:01:13.310> kids<00:01:13.580> playing<00:01:13.850> with<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.179> you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
so you know kids playing with it you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.460 
so you know kids playing with it you
know<00:01:14.479> once<00:01:14.690> they<00:01:14.810> break<00:01:15.050> it<00:01:15.200> they're<00:01:15.320> just

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
know once they break it they're just

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.930 
know once they break it they're just
gonna<00:01:15.560> throw<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:15.950> away<00:01:16.039> so<00:01:16.190> that's<00:01:16.520> why<00:01:16.789> a<00:01:16.820> lot

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
gonna throw it away so that's why a lot

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.109 
gonna throw it away so that's why a lot
of<00:01:17.240> them<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:17.990> probably<00:01:18.229> rarer<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:19.939> a

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
of them it's probably rarer so it's a

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.100 
of them it's probably rarer so it's a
very<00:01:20.360> nice<00:01:20.600> figure

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
very nice figure

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.870 
very nice figure
um<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.830> has<00:01:22.070> been<00:01:22.280> retooled<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.509> repainted<00:01:24.409> to

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
um it has been retooled and repainted to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.469 
um it has been retooled and repainted to
well<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.570> time<00:01:26.840> definitely<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.360> was

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
well one time definitely it and it was

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.050

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
opinion but I actually thought it was

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.700 
opinion but I actually thought it was
