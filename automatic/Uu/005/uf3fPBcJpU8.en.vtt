00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.690
 xx of williams all 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.730
 vote 5 disney christmas movie 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 animation studios attention not to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 pixar is an animated computer movie 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.080
 graphic set in this imaginary 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 city ​​of san francisco that mixes 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 elements of Japan and the minds of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.570
 san francisco states for 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:30.630
 the note found me very disappointed 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 for many things to give back i 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:48.180
 votes I want to tell you why this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.680
 film the island this team coming 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.449
 pleasure from the orders of kids and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.170
 guys that will soften up from the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 puppet on the robot character 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.609
 zoe puppet but in reality it is only one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 long sequence of manual skills and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.539
 stereotypes about a thousand things about clichés 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 those are just nice scenes 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 with the puppet that perhaps a tender thing 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 once finished those are just scenes 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 action views and magazines 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.549
 a plot that does not support the minimum 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.979
 very childish interest in jokes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 little account and nothing else sin between 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.580
 the other the film is produced by john 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.070
 lassetter among others, however, does not have us 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 revised that quality that genius 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 disney or of other productions 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.310
 absolutely pixar and let's say it is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 it was a big disappointment then this is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 my point of view 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 probably many of you will see it e 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.070
 so I wait for comments and even insults 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.189
 of all those among you who are one 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's say some little girls infoi cones 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.439
 pupazzoni subscribe to the channel and good 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 native Asmini today my dear friend 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.890
 matteo is back to reunite the couple 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.440
 magic 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.409
 I admit to being negatively of 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.770
 part 1 because we are not cinemas at all 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.390
 never go to christmas we want to be more 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.920
 good we gave another chance but 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.659
 I don't have but actually just because it was 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.700
 the only one of China's only son who praised 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.820
 then what we wanted we deserved 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.610
 past 45 50 minutes to block 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.110
 advertising and excess but at home they look 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 television, and then why 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
 we slept the whole second time 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.000
 so I can't judge end images 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.940
 only first time is a film based on 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.590
 stupidity of a robot 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.680
 so it makes you laugh like twice but 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.410
 for the other 40 minutes and first time 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.480
 all at the meeting and then fucking yet another 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.940
 time to throw in and superhero in a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.739
 film that I thought was more concentrated 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.030
 on the robot instead not once again 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.030
 superheroes under the dick 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.099
 fortunately the evening was not 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.439
 completely thrown out due to the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.000
 short film that is at the beginning of the film that 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.860
 it's called wheels that tells the story 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 of a dog of his master and that is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.049
 really very beautiful and exciting e 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.500
 stylish good taste a good story 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.799
 finished and cared for and deserves the evening 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 shame about the whole movie though at least 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.959
 it seems that the disney has taken 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.840
 starting from the courts of the pizza network 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.370
 looks good a good thing to be 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.370
 start proposing these shorts
