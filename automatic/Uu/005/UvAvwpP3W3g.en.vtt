 very good everyone today I bring you something 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.490
 Very simple is fish broth ni 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.980
 more or less but a fish stock 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.160
 basic so to be able to prepare 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.070
 any type of rice stew what 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 that you happen to need the broth 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 of fish 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.810
 it is basic what you will need in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 this case, I have chosen 4 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.910
 prawns you can choose a lobster 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 or any other good type depends on 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 the economy of each one a head of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.440
 monkfish and mixed whitebait that you can 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.360
 ask at the fish market is quite 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 pretty simple you're going to need some 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.640
 500 grams plus or minus half kilo of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.040
 hemorrhage the head of monkfish and what 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.079
 want to have more a sheet of 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.969
 laurel and a good handful of salt 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 we will fill it with water we will cover it 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.080
 enough with water a liter and a half more or 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 less and we will add an onion first 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 this is going to cook for an hour and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.689
 half simmering is worth first a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.990
 fast game and then we download it and what 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.119
