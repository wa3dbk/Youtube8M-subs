overall<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.080> general<00:02:20.440> since<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.709> games<00:02:20.950> been

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
overall in general since this games been

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.530 
overall in general since this games been
out<00:02:21.250> for<00:02:21.430> five<00:02:21.580> months<00:02:21.790> now<00:02:21.940> i<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.300> say<00:02:22.390> that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
out for five months now i can say that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.059 
out for five months now i can say that
exosuits<00:02:23.140> have<00:02:23.230> made<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.800> game<00:02:24.010> very

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
exosuits have made this game very

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.460 
exosuits have made this game very
entertaining<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.000> play<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.600> think<00:02:26.020> exosuits

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
entertaining to play I think exosuits

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.840 
entertaining to play I think exosuits
are<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> lot<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.860> fun<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.130> play<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:27.790> it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
are a lot of fun to play with I think it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.309 
are a lot of fun to play with I think it
makes<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> give<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> lot<00:02:28.450> more<00:02:28.600> interesting<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
makes to give a lot more interesting and

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.540 
makes to give a lot more interesting and
I<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.920> gives<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> lot<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.430> different

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
I think it gives you a lot of different

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.550 
I think it gives you a lot of different
options<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.239> how<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.390> play<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> game<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.110> with

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
options on how to play the game now with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.370 
options on how to play the game now with
that<00:02:32.680> being<00:02:32.739> said<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.900> don't<00:02:34.900> think<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.230> should

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that being said I don't think it should

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.840 
that being said I don't think it should
be<00:02:35.410> back<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.709> black<00:02:35.950> ops<00:02:36.160> 3<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.459> don't<00:02:36.670> think

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
be back in black ops 3 I don't think

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.460 
be back in black ops 3 I don't think
there<00:02:36.970> will<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.239> exosuits<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:37.989> black<00:02:38.170> ops<00:02:38.350> 3

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
there will be exosuits in black ops 3

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.990 
there will be exosuits in black ops 3
and<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.800> reason<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.160> because<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and the reason is because it's a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.280 
and the reason is because it's a
treyarch<00:02:40.420> game<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:40.780> not<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> sledgehammer

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
treyarch game it's not a sledgehammer

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.229 
treyarch game it's not a sledgehammer
game<00:02:41.709> sledgehammer<00:02:42.220> introduced<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> exosuit

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
game sledgehammer introduced the exosuit

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.810 
game sledgehammer introduced the exosuit

and this game black ops 3 has been in
production<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.390> at<00:02:46.600> least<00:02:46.720> two<00:02:46.930> years<00:02:47.170> now

just going to reenter in it he said that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180 
just going to reenter in it he said that
black<00:02:55.780> ops<00:02:55.989> 3<00:02:56.230> has<00:02:56.410> been<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.800> works<00:02:56.830> since

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
black ops 3 has been in the works since

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.949 
black ops 3 has been in the works since
black<00:02:57.550> ops<00:02:57.760> 2<00:02:57.940> was<00:02:58.090> created<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.600> was<00:02:58.720> back<00:02:58.930> in

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
black ops 2 was created that was back in

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.009 
black ops 2 was created that was back in
2012<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.980> believe<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.340> 2013<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.720> they've<00:03:01.900> been

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
2012 I believe or 2013 so they've been

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.449 
2012 I believe or 2013 so they've been
making<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.500> game<00:03:02.530> since<00:03:03.069> then<00:03:03.280> before

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
making that game since then before

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.759 
making that game since then before
exosuits<00:03:04.150> were<00:03:04.269> even<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.720> call<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:04.989> duty<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.530> I

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
exosuits were even in call of duty so I

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.030 
exosuits were even in call of duty so I
doubt<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.640> al<00:03:06.940> black<00:03:07.420> ops<00:03:07.630> 3<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:08.890> not

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
doubt that's al black ops 3 and I not

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.470 
doubt that's al black ops 3 and I not
the<00:03:09.130> makers<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.430> treyarch<00:03:09.880> are<00:03:10.239> going<00:03:10.420> to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the makers of treyarch are going to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.330 
the makers of treyarch are going to
implement<00:03:10.780> an<00:03:11.049> exosuit<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> game<00:03:12.190> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
implement an exosuit into a game and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.190 
implement an exosuit into a game and
start<00:03:12.700> working<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.120> an<00:03:13.209> exosuit<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> game

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
start working on an exosuit for a game

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.470 
start working on an exosuit for a game
that<00:03:14.860> hasn't<00:03:15.340> even<00:03:15.370> featured<00:03:15.760> exosuits<00:03:16.209> up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
that hasn't even featured exosuits up

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.360 
that hasn't even featured exosuits up
until<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.900> point<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.230> time<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:18.160> would<00:03:18.280> be

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
until that point in time so it would be

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.100 
until that point in time so it would be
very<00:03:18.579> unlikely<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.269> see<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.959> black

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
very unlikely to see it back in black

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.620 
very unlikely to see it back in black
ops<00:03:20.320> 3<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.130> wouldn't<00:03:21.640> mind<00:03:21.880> if<00:03:22.090> exosuits

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
ops 3 but I wouldn't mind if exosuits

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.180 
ops 3 but I wouldn't mind if exosuits
wearing<00:03:22.870> black<00:03:23.019> ops<00:03:23.230> 3<00:03:23.410> as<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> player<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.829> think

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
wearing black ops 3 as a player I think

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.319 
wearing black ops 3 as a player I think
it<00:03:24.280> makes<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.489> gave<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> lot<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.910> fun<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.239> i

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
it makes it gave a lot of fun like i

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.630 
it makes it gave a lot of fun like i
said<00:03:25.510> before<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:26.079> as<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.620> spectator<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.549> know

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
said before but as a spectator you know

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.580 
said before but as a spectator you know
I<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.329> don't<00:03:28.510> mind<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.900> think<00:03:28.930> exosuits

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
I really don't mind I think exosuits

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.560 
I really don't mind I think exosuits
make<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.860> game<00:03:29.980> fun<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.280> watch<00:03:30.430> as<00:03:30.670> well<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.390> I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
make the game fun to watch as well but I

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.970 
make the game fun to watch as well but I
just<00:03:31.750> don't<00:03:31.959> see<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.140> happening<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:32.859> see

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
just don't see it happening I just see

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.979 
just don't see it happening I just see
black<00:03:33.190> ops<00:03:33.430> 3<00:03:33.609> being<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.209> standard<00:03:34.690> call<00:03:34.870> of

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
black ops 3 being a standard call of

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.900 
black ops 3 being a standard call of
duty<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.500> black<00:03:35.709> ops<00:03:35.920> 2<00:03:36.100> was<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.790> like

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
duty just like black ops 2 was just like

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.039 
duty just like black ops 2 was just like
all<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> other<00:03:37.269> call<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.570> duties<00:03:37.780> were<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:37.989> the

vonderhaar and his staff did a
phenomenal<00:03:46.060> job<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.930> game<00:03:47.109> i<00:03:47.140> think

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
phenomenal job in that game i think

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.410 
phenomenal job in that game i think
ghost<00:03:47.680> was<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.130> little<00:03:48.579> bit<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.850> slow<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> year

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
ghost was a little bit of a slow a year

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.940 
ghost was a little bit of a slow a year
but<00:03:49.570> all<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:49.959> all<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.320> didn't<00:03:50.739> mind<00:03:50.829> playing

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
but all in all I didn't mind playing

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.650 
but all in all I didn't mind playing
call<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.430> duty<00:03:51.549> ghosts<00:03:51.910> at<00:03:52.060> all<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.299> honestly

call of duty ghosts at all and honestly

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.539 
call of duty ghosts at all and honestly
the<00:03:53.140> viewership<00:03:53.470> didn't<00:03:53.890> really<00:03:54.070> decrease<00:03:54.400> if

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
the viewership didn't really decrease if

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.670 
the viewership didn't really decrease if
anything<00:03:54.910> an<00:03:55.000> increase<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.320> game<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
anything an increase so in this game it

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.870 
anything an increase so in this game it
increased<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> little<00:03:57.130> bit<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.430> Call<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.609> Duty

increased a little bit in Call of Duty
goes<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.180> increase<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.600> black<00:03:58.780> ops<00:03:58.989> 2<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.470> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
goes to increase on black ops 2 and I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.319 
goes to increase on black ops 2 and I
honestly<00:03:59.859> think<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.400> black<00:04:00.670> ops<00:04:00.880> 3<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.180> going

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
honestly think that black ops 3 is going

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.849 
honestly think that black ops 3 is going
to<00:04:01.390> blow<00:04:01.570> every<00:04:01.959> single<00:04:02.260> call<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.500> duty<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
to blow every single call of duty in the

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:03.200 
to blow every single call of duty in the
past

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
past

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.520 
past
out<00:04:03.300> of<00:04:03.420> them<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.930> market<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.410> I

out of them out of the market like I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
out of them out of the market like I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.320 
gonna swim explode for all the fans I

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
just think overall it's gonna be a

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.210 
just think overall it's gonna be a
really<00:04:12.510> good<00:04:12.690> game<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:13.770> don't<00:04:14.040> think

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
really good game but I don't think

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.830 
really good game but I don't think
exosuits<00:04:14.730> will<00:04:14.940> be<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.450> don't<00:04:15.660> think

exosuits will be back and I don't think

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.390 
exosuits will be back and I don't think
they<00:04:15.900> should<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:16.230> back<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:17.190> anything

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
they should be back I think if anything

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.650 
they should be back I think if anything
excellent<00:04:18.090> should<00:04:18.210> be<00:04:18.300> in<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.450> next

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
excellent should be in the next

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.479 
excellent should be in the next
sledgehammer<00:04:19.140> game<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.380> don't<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.860> Treyarch

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
sledgehammer game I don't think Treyarch

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.860 
sledgehammer game I don't think Treyarch
should<00:04:20.640> implement<00:04:21.090> actually<00:04:21.510> she's<00:04:21.660> just

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
should implement actually she's just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.390 
should implement actually she's just
because<00:04:22.140> it's<00:04:22.710> something<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.130> sledgehammer

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
because it's something that sledgehammer

things you know I could I can crash in

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.800 
things you know I could I can crash in
this<00:04:35.460> window<00:04:35.730> right<00:04:35.760> here<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.210> can<00:04:36.450> pick<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.600> guy

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
this window right here I can pick a guy

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.450 
this window right here I can pick a guy
over<00:04:36.960> here<00:04:37.050> or<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.800> guy's<00:04:37.980> gonna<00:04:38.160> think<00:04:38.370> I'm

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
over here or this guy's gonna think I'm

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.620 
over here or this guy's gonna think I'm
in<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.610> window<00:04:38.820> he<00:04:38.940> might<00:04:39.060> be<00:04:39.180> dreaming<00:04:39.540> this

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
in the window he might be dreaming this

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.180 
in the window he might be dreaming this
so<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.840> could<00:04:39.990> just<00:04:40.080> double<00:04:40.260> jump<00:04:40.590> on<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.070> other

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
so I could just double jump on the other

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.950 
so I could just double jump on the other
side<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.610> just<00:04:41.700> shoot<00:04:41.970> up<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.690> gives<00:04:42.840> you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
side and just shoot up so it gives you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.300 
side and just shoot up so it gives you
more<00:04:43.110> options<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.620> shoot<00:04:43.890> your<00:04:44.010> gun<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.250> a

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
more options to shoot your gun as a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.770 
more options to shoot your gun as a
player<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.910> makes<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.180> extremely<00:04:45.450> difficult

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
player it makes it extremely difficult

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.600
