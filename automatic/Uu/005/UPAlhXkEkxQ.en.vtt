00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
Sophia waffles other than a super

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.700 
Sophia waffles other than a super
adorable<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:27.550> tag<00:02:29.850> guys<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:32.320> actually

adorable with tag guys they actually

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.440 
adorable with tag guys they actually
come<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.010> packaging<00:02:33.459> but<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.730> think<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.209> tag

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
come in packaging but I think a tag

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.449 
come in packaging but I think a tag
would<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.780> way<00:02:34.959> cuter<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.220> one<00:02:36.370> just

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
would be way cuter and this one just

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.750 
would be way cuter and this one just
comes<00:02:36.670> into<00:02:36.880> packaging<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:39.070> sequel<00:02:39.550> War<00:02:39.730> II

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
comes into packaging for a sequel War II

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
comes into packaging for a sequel War II
and<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:40.360> excellent<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.840> chose<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.380> I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
and then excellent I chose is this I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.440 
and then excellent I chose is this I
wrote<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.860> sealed<00:02:42.130> donut<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.000> already<00:02:43.150> has

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
wrote in sealed donut and it already has

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.090 
wrote in sealed donut and it already has
like<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.750> rubber<00:02:44.050> tag<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.680> think<00:02:44.980> it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
like this rubber tag but I think it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.830 
like this rubber tag but I think it
would<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.400> super<00:02:45.640> adorable<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.480> came<00:02:46.630> with

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
would be super adorable if it came with

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350 
would be super adorable if it came with
like<00:02:47.020> its<00:02:47.290> own<00:02:47.470> tag<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.370> really<00:02:49.180> like

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
like its own tag because I really like

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.810 
like its own tag because I really like
the<00:02:49.660> way<00:02:49.840> cooler<00:02:50.500> doughnuts<00:02:50.890> are<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
the way cooler doughnuts are and the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.310 
the way cooler doughnuts are and the
appearance<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.330> them<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.200> they

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
appearance of them so I think if they

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.960 
appearance of them so I think if they
had<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> cruller<00:02:54.040> donut<00:02:54.340> tag<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.820> would

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
had like a cruller donut tag that would

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.490 
had like a cruller donut tag that would
be<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.420> super<00:02:55.840> adorable<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.870> last<00:02:59.170> and

be like super adorable the last and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.110 
be like super adorable the last and
