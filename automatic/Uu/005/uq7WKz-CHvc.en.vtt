corned beef my goodness is so hard try
not<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.750> break<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:04.990> up<00:05:05.199> that<00:05:05.470> much<00:05:05.740> because<00:05:06.639> it

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
not to break it up that much because it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.909 
not to break it up that much because it
will<00:05:07.270> cook<00:05:07.570> down<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:13.350> now<00:05:14.350> we're<00:05:14.530> gonna<00:05:14.680> move

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919

this around and we're gonna let it cook

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.120 
this around and we're gonna let it cook
I<00:05:18.550> think<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:19.000> needs<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.389> little<00:05:19.510> bit<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.900> water

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.090 

so<00:05:24.130> I'm<00:05:24.370> gonna<00:05:24.550> add<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.850> little<00:05:25.000> bit<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.449> water

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
so I'm gonna add a little bit of water

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.800

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
before and hide it from us because we

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.460 
before and hide it from us because we
used<00:07:11.860> to<00:07:12.039> steal<00:07:12.250> them<00:07:12.509> but<00:07:13.509> you<00:07:13.750> just<00:07:13.930> mix<00:07:14.229> them

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
used to steal them but you just mix them

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.450 
used to steal them but you just mix them

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
in and with the same heat the reason why

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.850 
in and with the same heat the reason why
they<00:07:18.639> have<00:07:18.669> to<00:07:18.940> be<00:07:18.970> day-old<00:07:19.539> in<00:07:19.810> my<00:07:20.319> opinion

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
they have to be day-old in my opinion

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.490 
they have to be day-old in my opinion
because<00:07:21.699> if<00:07:21.819> you<00:07:21.940> just<00:07:22.180> fry<00:07:22.449> them<00:07:22.479> at<00:07:23.289> the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
because if you just fry them at the

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.339 
because if you just fry them at the
moment<00:07:23.860> they're<00:07:24.520> going<00:07:24.849> to<00:07:25.060> be<00:07:25.240> very<00:07:25.870> they're
