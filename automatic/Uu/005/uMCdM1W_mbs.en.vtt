00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.769
 hello good morning my name is ramÃ³n 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.990
 qatar represented the company serveis 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.170
 qatar integrals and we are collaborating in 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.689
 some sample videos to teach 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.750
 The different qualities and finishes in 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.820
 kitchen countertops basically today 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.550
 concretely we commented some types 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.949
 of countertops such as granite or 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.240
 marble like about see here there are 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.029
 different finishes from the marble 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.370
 traditional and the silestone as another 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.230
 resistance and durability option 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.600
 nowadays it is demanded a lot is asked in the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 sector we also have different types 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.309
 of silestone and with different 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.080
 tonalities and another type of finish would be 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.239
 the traditional way to put 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.129
 countertops then inside what they were 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.100
 It puts you can face what are the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.830
 picas also that that would be a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600
 very basic news in the silestone in 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.970
 how many stoner finishes we would talk about 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.440
 many qualities here you can see no 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.170
 just the different types of colors that 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.699
 they give us silestone and we can 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.690
 see from happening white 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.120
 traditional to black africa 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.610
 stellar black we could talk 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.870
 also the bright red of other colors 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.040
 as they are the star eros and thus a 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.020
 Frequency of colors that do not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 we would finish to place in if they 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 you put then another type of material would be 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 the coria a little clearer than if you 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 put all this would be interesting then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 with winter detail in the case of each 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.760
 one depending on the budget that is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.760
 want to spend 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.340

 find much more information of everything 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.650
 what we do in integral service 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.810
 catsup dotcom would serveis and a half 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.310
 integral if a medium catapulted com and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
 here you can find in the works
