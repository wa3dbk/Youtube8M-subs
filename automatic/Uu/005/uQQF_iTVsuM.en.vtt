00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.710 
bluffing I feel even though this is part
of<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.319> Minsk<00:02:33.129> agreement<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.599> was

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
of this Minsk agreement that was

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.220 
of this Minsk agreement that was
established<00:02:36.390> somebody's<00:02:37.390> bluffing<00:02:37.810> big<00:02:37.989> time

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
established somebody's bluffing big time

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.410 
established somebody's bluffing big time
and<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:39.549> think<00:02:39.760> somebody's<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> try<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and I think somebody's going to try and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.100 
and I think somebody's going to try and
take<00:02:40.629> advantage<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.319> having<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.879> other

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
take advantage of having of the other

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.559 
take advantage of having of the other
