00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello already we are the audience today i want 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.420
 show you how to connect to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.540
 wireless network want to consider 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 several options option 1 for example 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 do you have a wireless network 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.180
 she is somehow named in my case 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.230
 let's see my network is called Sultan 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.699
 it's called everything works ok and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.769
 I decided to change my password 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.449
 I change the password for this network and I have 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.989
 the network disappears i.e. it just doesn't 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.149
 works like to be let's go start 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.700
 control panel wake up state 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.940
 networking and wireless network management 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.160
 here and our network that we need to do 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.550
 need began to remove the network to find it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.550
 reconnect and let's remove 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 close the window again go to the right 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 bottom corner see our network you do n't 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.809
 Click on it and apparently at home all these 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.809
 called sultan connection 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.830
 and has hammered the password that is 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.540
 have your new password so let's say if you 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.410
 forgot password 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.370
 This is the second wireless network option . 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.990
 reinstall the computer decided 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.380
 connect and forget your password 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.870
 there is an option here to us below 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.390
 offer on the router to press a button 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.860
 accordingly thereby computers 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.630
 the rotor begins to exchange information 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.650
 and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.730
 computer gets gets access code 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 from the rotor directly or if you 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.850
 don't want to bother with this let's say 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.640
 and there is no this function on the router then you 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.390
 you just need to go to the router interface 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.140
 and change the password in this case I 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.140
 instruct remember 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 and press ok 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.459
 all networks we have connected internet with us 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.400
