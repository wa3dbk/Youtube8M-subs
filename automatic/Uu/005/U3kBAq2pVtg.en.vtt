 vertical garden can be done both 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.180
 outside and in the house but for this 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.700
 plants need to combine with 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.200
 conditions of the chosen environment is 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020

 Are you going to think about making this wall? 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.829

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.300
 shadow the half shadow black shadow wants 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.910

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.040
 for once while in the case today we are going 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.800
 make a wall for shade 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.080
 we have three types of ferns 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.720
 fern but common that we call 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.180
 American ferns if you go on ceasa 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.920
 place that you will find with this name 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.150
 The Christ fern that has all this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.909
 and to the Portuguese income that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.790
 also since the time of Grandmother people 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.979
 knows this fern which is a grace and 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.580
 we have here also by types of 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.979
 fagot and grows looks pretty and cool 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 The next step then we know where 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.939
 let's put these plants as plant 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.520
 how to put the na vertical 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.979
 I'm here with my mobile 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.790
 wood and a novelty in the market I found 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.790
 super cool this is a cache then cough 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.800
 that I cacheped the difference of the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.510
 vase is that the puhlmann cache has the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.230
 like vase inside so I can take it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.350
 this plant that it is already stored 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.750
 in plastic or metal vessel 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.480
 Now I'm going to show you how we 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.520
 makes to put the plant in the pipe 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.460
 I'm here with some rectal scarves 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.149
 that are simple and that you can 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.369
 find in branch stores and 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.599
 supermarkets are colorful they are super 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.110
 cute 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.120
 we will use the sand and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.409
 common sand area for construction 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 drain 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.510
 drainage 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.269
 where stored water is stored 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.140
 is left of what we will call the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.690
 plan 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.440
 so here I put some sand 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.220
 in the bottom of the vase and then we will pass 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.579
 transfer ours to our fern 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.379
 chito diverted to the cache little place 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:49.180
 plus a little earth grip it 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.280
 stay firm and then I'll use Dona Flor 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.470
 fern one leaf fertilizer manure 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.530
 This is people here every 15 days. 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.579
 the fern they stick together in the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.489
 trees 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.790
 they need this fertilization a lot 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.010
 leaf that is what we have in the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.010
 nature the dudu 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.200
 now that we've put the plants 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.440
 fertilizers the rule there are several systems 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.740
 irrigation to the vertical wall in the case 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.100
 this is a small system I advise 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.860
 you manually reg with watering can or 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.050
 jug with water twice 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.700
 depending on where you are 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.980
 in the country, right? 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.830
 the best in q1 but guides irrigation is 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.650
 The little finger on earth saw people wet 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.290
 no need to rescue a little dry 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.760
 does not let the land dry too much and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.770
 get very wet 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.810
 I hope you have taken advantage of the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.860
 tips if you make a living wall 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.840
 in your house 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.840
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
