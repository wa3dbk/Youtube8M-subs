00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
one fits their needs for me I have less

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.070 
one fits their needs for me I have less
than<00:01:15.690> 3<00:01:16.690> devices<00:01:17.820> basically<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.030> use<00:01:19.720> some<00:01:19.900> long

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
than 3 devices basically I use some long

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.860 
than 3 devices basically I use some long
time<00:01:20.229> usually<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.580> this<00:01:22.270> one<00:01:22.420> works<00:01:22.630> well<00:01:22.810> for

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
time usually so this one works well for

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.649 
time usually so this one works well for
me

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
me

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.390 
me
so<00:01:25.659> basically<00:01:26.080> this<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.860> back<00:01:27.040> view<00:01:27.070> of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
so basically this is the back view of

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.859 
so basically this is the back view of
the<00:01:27.520> router<00:01:27.700> I'm<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.210> show<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.420> a

the CD

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.130 
the CD
here<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.180> use<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.450> CD<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> install<00:02:18.120> or<00:02:19.140> you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
here you use the CD to install or you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.490 
here you use the CD to install or you
could<00:02:20.260> bypass<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.800> CD<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.370> they<00:02:22.300> C<00:02:22.500> goes

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
could bypass the CD and they C goes

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.680 
could bypass the CD and they C goes
directly<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> router<00:02:25.080> okay<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.950> that's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
directly into the router okay so that's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.240 
directly into the router okay so that's
basically<00:02:28.690> an<00:02:28.930> idea<00:02:29.230> how<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.560> works<00:02:29.680> okay<00:02:30.190> I'm

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
basically an idea how it works okay I'm

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.580 
basically an idea how it works okay I'm
going<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.400> show<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.730> quick<00:02:30.940> view<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
going to show you a quick view of the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.449 
going to show you a quick view of the
router<00:02:34.560> okay<00:02:35.560> everybody<00:02:35.920> let's<00:02:36.010> take<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> look

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
router okay everybody let's take a look

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.460 
router okay everybody let's take a look
at<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> ports<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.150> back<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.540> my<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.290> e

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
at the ports in back of my this is e

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.000 
at the ports in back of my this is e
1200<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.030> basically<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.560> setup<00:02:41.799> is<00:02:41.980> very

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
1200 so basically the setup is very

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.570 
1200 so basically the setup is very
simple<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.580> have<00:02:43.290> basically<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.650> first<00:02:45.489> of

all I'm going to show you this is the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.559

a lot of people there's two different
methods

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
methods

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.129 
methods
went<00:04:28.910> through<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.150> CD<00:04:29.569> which<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:29.930> quite

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
went through the CD which is quite

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.890 
went through the CD which is quite
simple<00:04:30.710> another<00:04:31.550> one<00:04:31.789> is<00:04:31.940> actually<00:04:32.360> just<00:04:32.690> go

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
simple another one is actually just go

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.460 
simple another one is actually just go
through<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.440> webpage<00:04:34.039> with<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.259> default<00:04:36.259> IP

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
through the webpage with the default IP

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
through the webpage with the default IP
address<00:04:37.069> -<00:04:37.729> again<00:04:37.970> -<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.300> logins<00:04:39.169> admin<00:04:39.590> then

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
address - again - the logins admin then

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.710 
address - again - the logins admin then
you<00:04:40.639> can<00:04:40.759> set<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.120> way<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.569> basically

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
you can set it that way so basically
