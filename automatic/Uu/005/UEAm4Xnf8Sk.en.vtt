00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
who could transform a fairy tale

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910 
who could transform a fairy tale
now<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> means<00:01:00.539> three<00:01:00.809> people<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.710> can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
now that means three people it can

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
now that means three people it can
either<00:01:01.980> mean<00:01:03.650> Elfman<00:01:04.880> getting<00:01:05.880> mean<00:01:06.000> era<00:01:06.299> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
either mean Elfman getting mean era or

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.620 
either mean Elfman getting mean era or
it<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.619> mean<00:01:08.840> Mary<00:01:09.840> Jane<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.890> era<00:01:11.130> era<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it can mean Mary Jane now era era is and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
it can mean Mary Jane now era era is and
I<00:01:12.990> guess<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.740> transformed<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.549> all

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I guess a way of transformed because all

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
I guess a way of transformed because all
she<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.780> translation<00:01:16.290> type<00:01:16.500> magic<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
she can use translation type magic I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.740 
she can use translation type magic I
mean<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.150> weird<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
mean it is kind of weird because it is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
mean it is kind of weird because it is
agree<00:01:19.110> equipping<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.880> guess<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> form<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
agree equipping I guess it is a form of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
agree equipping I guess it is a form of
transformation<00:01:21.869> maybe<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:22.890> sure<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
transformation maybe not too sure I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480 
transformation maybe not too sure I
doubt<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.110> guess<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> Kings<00:01:26.189> eyes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
doubt it but I guess in the Kings eyes

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.170 
doubt it but I guess in the Kings eyes
you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.540> consider<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.200> transformation<00:01:29.180> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you can consider it transformation that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
you can consider it transformation that

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
they were inside the Coliseum yeah once

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.409 
they were inside the Coliseum yeah once
they<00:06:21.159> leave<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.370> Coliseum<00:06:21.940> they're<00:06:22.120> okay

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
they leave the Coliseum they're okay

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.680 
they leave the Coliseum they're okay
they're<00:06:22.659> all<00:06:22.750> fine<00:06:23.020> so<00:06:24.270> keep<00:06:25.270> that<00:06:25.389> in<00:06:25.449> mind

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
they're all fine so keep that in mind

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
and the next chapter is called chariot

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.240 
and the next chapter is called chariot
and<00:06:28.719> I'm<00:06:28.930> assuming<00:06:29.380> that<00:06:29.409> because<00:06:29.949> it's<00:06:30.130> one

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
and I'm assuming that because it's one

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.189 
and I'm assuming that because it's one
of<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.370> games<00:06:30.630> chariot<00:06:31.630> if

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
of the games chariot if

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.350

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
be a type of race so I'm assuming that

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.820 
be a type of race so I'm assuming that
I'm<00:06:49.569> assuming<00:06:49.900> I'm<00:06:50.229> not<00:06:50.349> saying<00:06:50.529> that<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.710> is

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
I'm assuming I'm not saying that it is

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.800 
I'm assuming I'm not saying that it is
I'm<00:06:50.979> assuming<00:06:51.370> that<00:06:51.400> this<00:06:51.669> next<00:06:52.029> competition

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
I'm assuming that this next competition

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.409 
I'm assuming that this next competition
of<00:06:53.379> fairytale<00:06:53.800> for<00:06:54.069> next<00:06:54.279> chapter<00:06:54.669> may<00:06:55.150> be<00:06:55.210> a

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
of fairytale for next chapter may be a

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.249
