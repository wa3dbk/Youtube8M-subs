00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 south of the peninsula very good afternoons 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.029
 but also today we are still talking 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.290
 of cloudiness that continues to leave 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 some weak rain especially 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 concentrated in easternmost Cantabrian 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 in the Basque country pse north of singing 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.020
 even to first waves appeared clouds 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 compact to the north of asturias and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 the truth is that the next few hours those 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.550
 clouds will tend to dissipate 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 quickly as the hot sun already 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.260
 the evening look also as in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 Valladolid this morning the heavens and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.130
 fully cleared to its first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 hours because the length of the day is in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 deals will go back over the top 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 the 20 degrees look like today 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.230
 we will notice what we have been counting as 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 the maxims remain somewhat colder in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 the southern half of the peninsula, especially in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.219
 Andalusia and every Sunday morning of 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 may again increase those 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270
 diurnal temperatures in practically 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.649
 the whole country a more pronounced promotion 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.199
 towards the northwest of the peninsula 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 we have the anticyclone again that is going to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.100
 stay with us blocking 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.500
 those fronts that could be approximated by 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 the north and the true is great and that goes 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 to be pretty seasonal is going to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 protect from those squall those systems 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.690
 front look also how this one does not 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.700
 it is clear 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.740
 is absence of cloudiness those systems 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.870
 fronts that try to enter but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.780
 evidently the anticyclone blocks them 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.390
 and for tomorrow we will continue talking about 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 a very calm Sunday in the morning 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.730
 some clouds in the early hours more 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 compact without risk of rain in the 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.450
 northern third also tend to clear 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.760
 here the central ones of the day and already by 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 the afternoon there would appear clouds of type 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.420
 medium high without further consequence 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 northwest peninsular with lots of sun in the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.230
 rest is after some cloudiness 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 first and last hours in birds of 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.740
 narrow and sun too we go back to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 find tomorrow in a good part the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 Canary archipelago all this tomorrow 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 new sunday with temperatures that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.030
 traced the maximum will be noticed more 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.800
 elevated can buy it in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.300
 almost the entire country even 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.220
 new will reach the grade bits 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.380
 social and the inside of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 Galician community so in the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.710
 next hours the weather continues 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 stabilizing even in the north and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 for tomorrow we will make a sunny Sunday 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.380
 in much of the country to spend a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 happy late salty 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.650
 be this long may take a while 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.600
 very quiet very stable throughout the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.010
 country even alvaro in the north where already 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.260
 They have several days with very clouds 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 even compact that have left rain 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.500
 precipitation look like tomorrow 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.270
 Sunday this first Sunday in May 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.459
 presents stable quiet just with 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.110
 cloudiness in the first hours we can 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.030
 find in gaÃ­s del cantabrico also 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.680
 will tend to dissipate those very 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.180
 quickly as the sun heats the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.360
 atmosphere with a lot of sun or the rest 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.610
 of the country and temperatures by the way 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.930
 yes we have noticed slightly softer to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.000
 the southern half for tomorrow Sunday 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.520
 will again increase in practically 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.230
 the whole country a more pronounced rise in 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.360
 around three or four degrees that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.739
 we will add more in the northern half 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 peninsular but we see everything with more 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.760
 details in the space of time 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.040
 tourres peninsular very good night 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.360
 where for example in Seville in Cordoba 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.280
 yesterday were above 30 degrees 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.380
 today it has fallen below that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.360
 value however for tomorrow sunday 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.250
 we hope changes again 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.350
 diurnal temperatures and is that we will return 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.060
 to add degrees to temperatures 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.130
 maximum in practically the whole country not 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.360
 it enters above all that thermal ascent in 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.070
 the center area the northwest half 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.410
 peninsular where we could even add 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630
 between 345 degrees 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.610
 with respect to those maxims that we notice 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.930
 in the day today but is that face 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.820
 to Monday 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.250
 this thermal ascent continues 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.130
 build and even increases a lot 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.930
 more daytime temperatures notice 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.270
 how could we even talk about a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 thermal rise that would be around 4 or 8 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.470
 degrees of more in the downtown area 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.010
 especially in the northern half 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.680
 peninsular today however despite 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.450
 that sun that we have seen in almost 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.370
 the whole country yes we have seen again 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.770
 clouds even clouds that have left ions 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.770
 and the truth is that for tomorrow too 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.330
 here we will see the sun now we see it with 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.100
 detail in the weather forecast what 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.860
 what will happen next days and of 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.380
 every morning it will be then that the time 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.790
 still stable, it's also so 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.850
 stable throughout the peninsular north 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.710
 we have is quite anticyclone 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.690
 stationary anchored on our country 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.610
 look like in the sequence in the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.490
 that we can appreciate that absence 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.950
 cloudiness that dominates over Spain and how 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.560
 the surrounding clouds swarm the north of the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.000
 peninsula and can not invade can not 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.380
 get closer to the rest of Spain ' 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.030
 precisely because of that anticyclone 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.910
 he pushes them 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.240
 up to tomorrow we will start a 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.040
 Sunday still with little cloudiness 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.300
 ships the third north with a lot of sun in 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.760
 the rest of the country but let's see the 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.530
 prediction in region by region and so 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.150
 nuanced we detail in each are 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.790
 we analyze by the northwest in galicia 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.080
 we hope it is not something more compact by 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.790
 the morning only affects the coast 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.250
 north also northern areas of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.110
 asturias with many are the 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.820
 central is true since it will leave the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.160
 Later we would see traces of the museum of type 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.030
 immediate without further consequence 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.350
 going into these regions with 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.090
 temperatures that here we have also 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.200
 seen will be noticed higher and will return 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.590
 to be above 20 degrees 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.080
 even skimming the 27 28 degrees again 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.490
 in inland areas of galicia in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.650
 ourense in the easternmost Cantabrian 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.169
 in the morning new clouds something more 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.780
 compact even with some low haze 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.180
 but that will tend to break quickly 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.340
 a lot of sun if there is any cloudiness 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.600
 thing affecting the first census without 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.550
 greater consequence with temperatures 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.900
 equally elevated above 20 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.090
 degrees by a certain caution because still 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.610
 tomorrow morning the wind will be something 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.200
 intense towards the north of Girona if we 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.969
 we are going to this Valencian community 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.979
 the much 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.049
 in the Balearics we will also talk about 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.059
 very much sun throughout the sunday 

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:33.589
 tomorrow with some cloudiness 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.849
 tomorrow it might look like a saw 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:37.369
 tramontana north of mallorca 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.709
 also dissipating rapidly according to 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:41.179
 the sun warms the atmosphere and with 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.729
 temperatures here also pretty 

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:47.209
 elevated on the north plateau so 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.009
 we will talk about cold temperatures even 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.959
 close to frost in the early hours 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.089
 see what values ââwe expect to 

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.249
 they present and they already rub against the 25 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.839
 degrees in much of these regions and 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.059
 in Andalusia because more of the same 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.099
 very calm sunday again with sun and 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.619
 with these temperatures that will return to 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.629
 be noticed in the interior skimming 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:07.279
 those winds being about 30 degrees 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.689
 relevant and that in the morning they could 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.059
 stop at some low-type business 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.399
 without major consequence and Canary Islands 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:16.219
 wait a Sunday too much sunshine 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:18.229
 with some clouds and with high melilla that 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.729
 yes you can approach during the 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.229
 morning to the west the archipelago 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.169
 without more and with these temperatures that 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.669
 will continue to hover around 25 degrees 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.159
 we advance one more day the television of 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.929
 face to Monday we will still be talking a 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.220
 very stable start of the week with that 

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.170
 cloud or medium and high type that follows 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.760
 it is noted in more areas half 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.650
 northern peninsular and temperatures have 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.590
 seen this day that they will even go back to 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.390
 touch the 30 degrees at many points in 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.220
 the southern half of the country 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.930
 we talk about sun the next days and 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.820
 by the way with a few seconds we will see the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.820
 Sun from a different perspective 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.870
 they come directly from the nasa to 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.970
 the latest images of that spectacular 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.650
 flare passion we do not get tired of seeing 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.750
 these images nothing but pass a 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.530
 happy night tomorrow more sun and more heat 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.530
 in all the country
