00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the V 1 11 s SL you know I wasn't a fan

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.240 
the V 1 11 s SL you know I wasn't a fan
of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.059> V<00:00:42.180> 1<00:00:42.420> 11<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.620> could<00:00:43.770> pray<00:00:43.890> tell<00:00:44.100> for

of the V 1 11 as you could pray tell for

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
of the V 1 11 as you could pray tell for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
my reviews of them and the SL version

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
my reviews of them and the SL version
was<00:00:46.140> obviously<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.770> preferred<00:00:47.340> boots

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
was obviously one of my preferred boots

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.819 
was obviously one of my preferred boots
on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> market<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:48.719> happy<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.800> see

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
on the market so I'm very happy to see

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.910 
on the market so I'm very happy to see
pull<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.000> move<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.510> new<00:00:51.780> design<00:00:52.140> getting

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
pull my move to this new design getting

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
pull my move to this new design getting
rid<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> box<00:00:53.520> toe<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.469> then<00:00:56.300> moving<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
rid of the box toe and then moving to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.029 
rid of the box toe and then moving to
what<00:00:57.570> looks<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> V<00:00:58.500> 1<00:00:58.680> 11<00:00:58.980> SL<00:01:01.039> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
what looks more like the V 1 11 SL so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
what looks more like the V 1 11 SL so
I'm<00:01:02.309> sure<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.640> still<00:01:02.789> planning<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.120> picture

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I'm sure you're still planning a picture

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
I'm sure you're still planning a picture
them<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.110> minimal<00:01:04.860> boot<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
them there are pretty minimal boot and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
them there are pretty minimal boot and
in<00:01:05.850> terms<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.210> design<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.740> letter<00:01:07.979> version

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
in terms of design the letter version

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
in terms of design the letter version
obviously<00:01:08.400> looks<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.470> regular

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
obviously looks different to the regular

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.950 
obviously looks different to the regular
synthetic<00:01:11.790> version<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.510> doesn't<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
synthetic version it doesn't have the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
synthetic version it doesn't have the
stripe<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.290> goes<00:01:13.590> along<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> front<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> it

eight<00:01:16.229> ounces<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.610> more

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

I'm<00:01:42.869> sure<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> grip<00:01:44.360> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
I'm sure that is for a grip and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
I'm sure that is for a grip and
retraction<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.530> don't<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> the
