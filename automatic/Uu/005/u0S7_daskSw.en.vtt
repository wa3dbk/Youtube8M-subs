very awesome you can control so much
with<00:07:31.809> this<00:07:32.019> thing<00:07:32.319> it's<00:07:32.860> also<00:07:33.009> got<00:07:33.279> a<00:07:33.309> buffer

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 
with this thing it's also got a buffer

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.909 
with this thing it's also got a buffer
inside<00:07:34.209> so<00:07:34.569> it<00:07:34.659> works<00:07:34.869> great<00:07:35.199> with<00:07:35.409> your<00:07:35.619> Foods
