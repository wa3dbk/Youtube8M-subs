00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
if it was I always thought that was the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 
if it was I always thought that was the
reason<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> didn't<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.009> school<00:01:44.159> but

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
reason and that I didn't like school but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.569 
reason and that I didn't like school but
in<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.810> hindsight<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.220> memory<00:01:47.549> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
in in hindsight I because my memory of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.330 
in in hindsight I because my memory of
school<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.000> before<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.770> then

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
school was before that was good and then

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
school was before that was good and then
after<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.210> horrible

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
after that it was horrible

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
after that it was horrible
so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> look<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> obviously<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
so it's but I look back I obviously I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.350 
so it's but I look back I obviously I
had<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.590> young<00:01:55.710> age<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.610> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
had it at a very young age and I just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.749 
had it at a very young age and I just
probably<00:01:57.540> was<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.110> stable<00:01:58.350> spot<00:01:58.799> not

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
probably was in a more stable spot not

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
probably was in a more stable spot not
having<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> change<00:02:00.360> school<00:02:00.630> than<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.869> liked

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
having to change school than I liked

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.749 
having to change school than I liked
school<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.170> could<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.380> of

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
school more and and but I could think of

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.210

that third grade fourth fifth sixth

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.919 
that third grade fourth fifth sixth
those<00:02:08.550> were<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.940> most<00:02:09.330> until<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.720> got<00:02:09.810> in
