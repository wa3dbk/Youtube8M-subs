00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
thing I want to point out is that this

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.840 
thing I want to point out is that this
is<00:01:02.019> not<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.320> pressure-sensitive<00:01:02.859> touchscreen

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850

it's a capacitive bastard a touchscreen
so<00:01:07.509> that<00:01:07.690> for<00:01:08.350> example<00:01:08.380> if<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.800> take<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.160> stylus

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
so that for example if I take the stylus

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.850 
so that for example if I take the stylus
from<00:01:09.759> another<00:01:10.030> phone<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.630> try<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.840> use<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.140> and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
from another phone and try to use it and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.859 
from another phone and try to use it and
see<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.610> screen<00:01:12.910> doesn't<00:01:13.179> respond<00:01:13.720> to

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
see that the screen doesn't respond to

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.499 
see that the screen doesn't respond to
the<00:01:13.960> pressure<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.440> stylus<00:01:15.130> rather<00:01:15.910> responds

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
the pressure the stylus rather responds

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.779 
the pressure the stylus rather responds
to<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.020> electrical<00:01:17.619> characteristics<00:01:18.520> of

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
to the electrical characteristics of

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:26.609 
to the electrical characteristics of
your<00:01:19.140> skin<00:01:20.140> for<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.619> sensitive<00:01:21.220> skin

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.660
