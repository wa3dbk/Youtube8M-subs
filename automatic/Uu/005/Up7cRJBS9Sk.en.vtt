effects<00:00:24.500> I've<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> say<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.369> lens

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
effects I've got to say that this lens

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
effects I've got to say that this lens
it<00:00:26.699> weighs<00:00:26.880> done<00:00:27.359> by<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> way<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:27.990> great<00:00:28.230> if

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it weighs done by the way it's great if

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.519 
it weighs done by the way it's great if
it<00:00:28.560> becomes<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.310> lens<00:00:29.609> hood<00:00:30.050> as<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> see

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it becomes a lens hood as you can see

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.630 
it becomes a lens hood as you can see
and<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:33.559> there<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> full<00:00:35.370> size

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and so there it is that's the full size

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.470 
and so there it is that's the full size
of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> lens

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
of the lens

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
of the lens
they<00:00:37.110> don't<00:00:37.290> switch<00:00:37.559> you've<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> AF

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
they don't switch you've got on it is AF

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.590 
they don't switch you've got on it is AF

this lens here really really easy it's a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
this lens here really really easy it's a
bit<00:00:51.750> D<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.440> tier<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> Canon

bit D like it's tier of them the Canon

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.420 
bit D like it's tier of them the Canon
one<00:00:54.020> but<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> capella<00:00:55.770> come<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> fit<00:00:56.280> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
one but it is a capella come and fit is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
one but it is a capella come and fit is
this<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.989> dearer<00:00:58.260> than

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this by the way then it's dearer than

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.229 
this by the way then it's dearer than
the<00:00:58.559> Canon<00:00:58.920> 50mm<00:00:59.280> eat<00:00:59.640> all<00:00:59.789> behind<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.530> but

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
the Canon 50mm eat all behind for but

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
the Canon 50mm eat all behind for but
it's<00:01:03.239> definitely<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.719> better<00:01:03.960> quality<00:01:04.229> lens<00:01:04.680> II

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's definitely a better quality lens II

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's definitely a better quality lens II
the<00:01:05.309> build<00:01:05.519> qualities<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.119> talking<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the build qualities are talking about it

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.280 
the build qualities are talking about it
for<00:01:07.260> causes<00:01:07.650> faster<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:09.030> Booker<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> ton

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
for causes faster the Booker is a ton

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.600 
for causes faster the Booker is a ton
better<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:12.439> if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:13.799> afford<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.280> spend

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
better and if you could afford to spend

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
better and if you could afford to spend
a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.180> money<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.650> sure<00:01:16.860> I'd<00:01:17.400> say

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a little bit more money for sure I'd say

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
a little bit more money for sure I'd say
get<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.240> over<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> camera<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.380> not

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
get this one over the camera it's not

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.039 
get this one over the camera it's not
Dawn's<00:01:20.100> better<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> lens

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
Dawn's better but it is about the lens

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
Dawn's better but it is about the lens
for<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> extra<00:01:22.979> hundred<00:01:23.100> pound<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.820> whatever

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
for the extra hundred pound or whatever

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.630 
for the extra hundred pound or whatever
it<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> might<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> better<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> cheap

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it is you might have better get it cheap

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
it is you might have better get it cheap
but<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.060> paid<00:01:27.299> 400<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.900> language<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
but I think I paid 400 for language it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
but I think I paid 400 for language it's
quite<00:01:29.189> expensive<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> 50

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
quite expensive really for a 50

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.230 
quite expensive really for a 50

all files a bit soft and you do get a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
bit of chromatic aberration I won't lie

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.010 
bit of chromatic aberration I won't lie
but<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.470> dual<00:01:49.680> second<00:01:50.070> job<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.399> most

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
but it's a dual second job in most

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.780 
but it's a dual second job in most
pieces<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> software<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.799> room<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.460> sure

and<00:01:55.480> suddenly<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.800> bit<00:01:56.980> soft<00:01:57.250> but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
and suddenly and it's a bit soft but

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.700 
and suddenly and it's a bit soft but
it's<00:01:58.180> there<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:58.690> you<00:01:58.720> need<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:59.140> use<00:01:59.260> one<00:01:59.470> point

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
it's there if you need to use one point

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's there if you need to use one point
for<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.370> works<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.750> f2<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.560> really<00:02:03.160> happens<00:02:03.670> of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
for it works but f2 it really happens of

like<00:02:09.430> say<00:02:09.729> a1<00:02:09.850> far<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:11.110> pictures<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.440> I'm

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
like say a1 far the pictures that I'm

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.240 
like say a1 far the pictures that I'm
going<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.770> show<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:11.980> between<00:02:12.970> f1<00:02:13.690> far<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.620> f28
