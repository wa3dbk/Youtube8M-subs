00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
teenager you know like you know like it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
teenager you know like you know like it
is<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:38.700> humans<00:00:39.590> but<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> come<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> find

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is for most humans but but come to find

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
caused by the fact that Mikey had put

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
caused by the fact that Mikey had put
retro-mutagen<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.140> he<00:00:52.289> thought<00:00:52.530> was

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
retro-mutagen of what he thought was

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
retro-mutagen of what he thought was
mutagen<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.520> his<00:00:53.879> face<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
mutagen on his face it was actually the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
mutagen on his face it was actually the
ring<00:00:55.140> engineered<00:00:55.559> retro<00:00:55.890> mutagen<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> was

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ring engineered retro mutagen but it was

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.479 
ring engineered retro mutagen but it was
a<00:00:56.789> bad<00:00:57.059> batch<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.070> now<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.760> it's

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
a bad batch and now it's it's it's

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
a bad batch and now it's it's it's
incredibly<00:01:02.489> unstable<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> within<00:01:04.170> three

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
incredibly unstable so within three

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
incredibly unstable so within three
hours<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:06.119> Donnie<00:01:06.510> Donnie<00:01:06.869> calculated<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
hours that Donnie Donnie calculated that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.800 
hours that Donnie Donnie calculated that
within<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:08.430> hours<00:01:08.460> those<00:01:09.420> plus<00:01:10.640> those

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
within three hours those plus those

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
within three hours those plus those
pus-filled<00:01:12.810> pimples<00:01:13.380> will<00:01:14.090> grow<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
pus-filled pimples will grow to the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.910 
pus-filled pimples will grow to the
point<00:01:15.509> where<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.020> explode

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
point where they explode

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
point where they explode
so<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.729> got<00:01:17.909> three<00:01:18.509> hours<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.020> engineer<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
so they got three hours to engineer a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
so they got three hours to engineer a
cure<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.490> need<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> proper<00:01:21.150> equipment

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
cure but they need the proper equipment

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.429 
cure but they need the proper equipment
they<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.320> high-powered<00:01:23.220> centrifuge<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
they need a high-powered centrifuge to

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
they need a high-powered centrifuge to
mix<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> chemicals<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:27.060> figure

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
mix the chemicals with so they figure

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
mix the chemicals with so they figure
that<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.350> place<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that the only place they can get one is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
that the only place they can get one is
at<00:01:29.670> tcri<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:31.049> tcri<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> only

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
at tcri why tcri because that's the only

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.950 
at tcri why tcri because that's the only
place<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> only<00:01:33.630> place<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
place they that's the only place they

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.850 
place they that's the only place they
found<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.659> they<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> tcri<00:01:37.290> they

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
found one um so they get to tcri they

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
found one um so they get to tcri they
find<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> centrifuge<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.150> lo<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.329> behold

tubes so when he and so when he presses
his<00:03:43.920> button<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.610> little<00:03:44.790> detonator<00:03:45.330> he's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
his button on this little detonator he's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.870 
his button on this little detonator he's
got<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.550> explode<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:50.430> Baxter

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
got it can it can explode if if Baxter

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.640 
got it can it can explode if if Baxter
Stockman<00:03:51.300> doesn't<00:03:51.540> keep<00:03:51.720> his<00:03:51.870> word<00:03:51.900> which

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
Stockman doesn't keep his word which

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800 
Stockman doesn't keep his word which
means<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:54.060> if<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.360> ends<00:03:54.690> up

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
means that if that if it ends up

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.320 
means that if that if it ends up
exploding<00:03:55.380> he<00:03:55.860> will<00:03:56.070> mutate<00:03:56.519> into<00:03:57.239> something

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
exploding he will mutate into something

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.060 
exploding he will mutate into something
and<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.810> think<00:03:57.870> they're<00:03:58.140> really<00:03:58.440> hinting<00:03:58.950> at

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
and I think they're really hinting at

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.070 
and I think they're really hinting at
the<00:03:59.100> fact<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.489> Baxter<00:03:59.940> Stockman<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the fact that Baxter Stockman and the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.500 
the fact that Baxter Stockman and the
earlier<00:04:01.500> series<00:04:02.030> becomes<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.180> mutant

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
earlier series becomes this mutant

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.650 
earlier series becomes this mutant
called<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.840> fly<00:04:04.459> because<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.880> recall<00:04:06.480> if

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
called the fly because I I recall if

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.110 
called the fly because I I recall if
someone<00:04:07.080> do<00:04:07.410> making<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.010> making<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.550> little<00:04:08.700> joke
