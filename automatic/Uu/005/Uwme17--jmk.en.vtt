00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.129 
different than my normal tips because
well<00:00:14.820> let's<00:00:14.940> wanted<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> discuss<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> little

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
well let's wanted to discuss a little

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
well let's wanted to discuss a little
bit<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.590> different<00:00:17.010> strategy<00:00:17.250> approach<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
bit of a different strategy approach to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.480 
bit of a different strategy approach to
making<00:00:18.570> gold<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.109> game<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.130> know<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
making gold in this game and you know I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.910 
making gold in this game and you know I
like<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.850> test<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> strategies<00:00:22.830> I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
like to test out a lot of strategies I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
like to test out a lot of strategies I
don't<00:00:23.070> rely<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.490> any<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.300> particular<00:00:24.510> method

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
don't rely on any one particular method

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.429 
don't rely on any one particular method
for<00:00:25.470> making<00:00:26.010> gold<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.960> point

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
for making gold and I think that point

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
for making gold and I think that point
is<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.769> worth<00:00:28.980> pressing<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.840> today<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
is really worth pressing so today I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.930 
is really worth pressing so today I
decided<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> conduct<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.790> little

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
decided I want to conduct a little

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.799 
decided I want to conduct a little
experiment<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:34.190> one<00:00:35.190> particular<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:36.030> form<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
experiment on one particular a form of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840 
experiment on one particular a form of
gold<00:00:37.050> farming<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.800> happens<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
gold farming this just happens to be the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.930 
gold farming this just happens to be the
trade<00:00:39.450> skill<00:00:39.750> fishing<00:00:40.399> you<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.550> lot<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
trade skill fishing you know a lot of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
trade skill fishing you know a lot of
people<00:00:42.059> myself<00:00:42.600> included<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:44.250> aware

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
people myself included are really aware

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090 
people myself included are really aware
just<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.180> gold<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.410> bring<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
just how much gold you can bring in with

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
just how much gold you can bring in with
fishing<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
fishing and I think it's kind of a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
fishing and I think it's kind of a
deceptive<00:00:49.980> profession<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.000> lot<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
deceptive profession because a lot of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
deceptive profession because a lot of
people<00:00:51.539> see<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.870> being<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.260> boring<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
people see it as being very boring and

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
people see it as being very boring and
maybe<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.180> mean<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.989> enjoy

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
maybe for you it is I mean I don't enjoy

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.990 
maybe for you it is I mean I don't enjoy
it<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.460> every<00:00:56.520> once<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it all that much but every once in a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200 
it all that much but every once in a
while<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.480> too<00:00:57.719> bad<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> anyway

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
while it's not too bad right so anyway

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.639 
while it's not too bad right so anyway
in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> past<00:01:00.690> couple<00:01:00.870> days<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.199> decided<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in the past couple days I decided I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
in the past couple days I decided I
level<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.190> fishing<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.359> know<00:01:03.420> give<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
a go so I hit 375 so I could start

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
a go so I hit 375 so I could start
taking<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.490> highest<00:01:08.850> level<00:01:09.090> pools

taking on the the highest level pools

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
taking on the the highest level pools
and<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.260> how<00:01:10.409> much<00:01:10.560> gold<00:01:10.770> i

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
it going to take it off but the average

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.860 
it going to take it off but the average
for<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.430> is<00:02:55.440> 768<00:02:56.940> over<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.510> got<00:02:58.660> an

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
for this is 768 over here we got an

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.910 
for this is 768 over here we got an
average<00:02:59.290> of<00:03:00.540> 163<00:03:01.540> which<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.440> probably<00:03:02.769> a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
average of 163 which is probably a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.670 
average of 163 which is probably a
little<00:03:03.160> bit<00:03:03.400> high<00:03:03.640> sometimes<00:03:04.540> these<00:03:05.200> certain

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
little bit high sometimes these certain

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
little bit high sometimes these certain
these<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.819> auctioneer<00:03:07.330> averages<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:08.049> off

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
these the auctioneer averages can be off

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.990 
these the auctioneer averages can be off
by<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.590> little<00:03:08.680> bit<00:03:11.130> 171<00:03:12.130> 42<00:03:12.549> which<00:03:12.790> seems

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
by a little bit 171 42 which seems

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.780 
by a little bit 171 42 which seems
reasonable<00:03:13.650> these<00:03:14.650> are<00:03:14.980> definitely<00:03:15.340> off

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
reasonable these are definitely off

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.229 
reasonable these are definitely off
because<00:03:16.060> nobody<00:03:16.420> ever<00:03:16.840> buys<00:03:17.140> any<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.560> these

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239
