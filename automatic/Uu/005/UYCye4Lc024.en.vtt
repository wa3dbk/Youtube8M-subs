00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
I've been reading reviews and basically

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.999 
I've been reading reviews and basically
the<00:01:39.250> only<00:01:39.369> negative<00:01:39.850> thing<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.860> they

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
the only negative thing is that if they

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.859 
the only negative thing is that if they
can't<00:01:42.250> find<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.520> sharpener<00:01:43.030> big<00:01:43.210> enough<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.720> have

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
can't find a sharpener big enough I have

a<00:01:43.899> Revlon<00:01:44.229> one<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.250> big<00:01:45.430> enough<00:01:45.460> it's<00:01:45.820> a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
a Revlon one and it's big enough it's a

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.830 
a Revlon one and it's big enough it's a
duo<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.960> small<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.710> then<00:01:47.860> large<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.030> don't

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
duo it's small and then large so I don't

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.780 
duo it's small and then large so I don't
check<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.080> out<00:01:50.380> but<00:01:51.130> anyway<00:01:51.310> um<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:53.369> used<00:01:54.369> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
check that out but anyway um I used to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.639 
check that out but anyway um I used to
use<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.960> mac<00:01:56.470> studio<00:01:57.630> finish<00:01:58.630> concealer<00:01:58.810> the

wants to say I have an oily face but
let's<00:04:38.240> call<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.539> moisturized<00:04:39.490> natural

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
let's call it moisturized natural

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.219 
let's call it moisturized natural
moisture<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.960> sounds<00:04:42.320> gross<00:04:42.530> too<00:04:42.910> anyway<00:04:44.229> so

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
moisture that sounds gross too anyway so

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.240 
moisture that sounds gross too anyway so
I<00:04:45.260> really<00:04:45.830> think<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.250> this<00:04:46.460> would<00:04:46.669> work<00:04:46.880> on

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
I really think that this would work on

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.590 
I really think that this would work on
dry<00:04:49.250> skin<00:04:49.310> really<00:04:50.030> well<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.520> don't<00:04:53.390> know

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
dry skin really well and I don't know

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.550 
dry skin really well and I don't know
maybe<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:54.080> like<00:04:54.890> even<00:04:55.220> better<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.990> would

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
maybe be like even better but I would

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.760 
maybe be like even better but I would

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
which i think is pretty mid-range for a

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.050 
which i think is pretty mid-range for a
good<00:05:47.669> concealer<00:05:48.240> I<00:05:49.080> would<00:05:49.949> have<00:05:50.039> paid<00:05:50.129> $30<00:05:50.789> for

with finding a perfect concealer so I

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.370

checking it out they have a wide range
of<00:06:01.289> colors<00:06:01.740> not<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:02.460> much<00:06:02.639> for<00:06:02.880> darker<00:06:03.270> skin

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.529 
of colors not so much for darker skin
tones<00:06:03.930> which<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.620> kind<00:06:04.889> of<00:06:04.979> disappointing<00:06:05.539> but

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
it's also very exciting for me because

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.740 
it's also very exciting for me because
nobody<00:06:09.810> makes<00:06:10.190> like<00:06:11.190> light<00:06:12.180> enough<00:06:12.479> makeup
