hi guys it's brendan and this is my

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.849 
hi guys it's brendan and this is my
biology<00:00:05.100> project<00:00:06.049> so<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.230> did<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.649> took

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
biology project so what I did is I took

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.230 
biology project so what I did is I took
my<00:00:08.160> favorite<00:00:08.490> game<00:00:08.639> which<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.910> all<00:00:09.030> about

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
my favorite game which is all about

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.990 
my favorite game which is all about
building<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.809> built<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.410> giant<00:00:10.650> cell<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.910> i'm

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
building I built a giant cell so i'm

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
building I built a giant cell so i'm
going<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> show<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> part<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.960> talk

going to show you the part and talk
about<00:00:13.920> their<00:00:14.280> functions<00:00:14.759> everything<00:00:16.520> okay

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
about their functions everything okay

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you know this is all blocks don't expect

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.439 
you know this is all blocks don't expect
it<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.970> super<00:00:24.180> detail<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.710> all<00:00:25.830> blocks<00:00:26.449> do

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it to be super detail it's all blocks do

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.620 
it to be super detail it's all blocks do
this<00:00:27.630> giant<00:00:28.560> sphere<00:00:28.830> right<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.420> forever<00:00:32.630> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
this giant sphere right here forever so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.910 
this giant sphere right here forever so
imma<00:00:33.989> start<00:00:34.200> off<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> nucleus<00:00:35.630> by<00:00:36.630> here

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
imma start off with the nucleus by here

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
imma start off with the nucleus by here
blue<00:00:37.920> part<00:00:39.170> all<00:00:40.170> right<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.940> um<00:00:41.940> it's

blue part all right there and um it's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.610 
blue part all right there and um it's
virgin<00:00:43.140> genetic<00:00:43.770> information<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.670> stored<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
virgin genetic information is stored and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.720 
virgin genetic information is stored and
a<00:00:46.620> controls<00:00:47.100> activity<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> cell<00:00:49.730> let's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
a controls activity for the cell let's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.619 
a controls activity for the cell let's
move<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:52.460> ribosomes<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:55.489> are<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:57.149> all

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
move on to ribosomes which are like all

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
move on to ribosomes which are like all
of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> spell<00:00:59.300> but<00:01:00.300> i<00:01:01.070> made<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.219> little

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
of the spell but i made these little

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
of the spell but i made these little
things<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.080> be<00:01:04.080> fun<00:01:06.470> there<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.619> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
things right here be fun there we go but

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
things right here be fun there we go but
up<00:01:08.880> um<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.479> i<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.659> his<00:01:12.780> writings

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
up um so that's what i put his writings

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.649 
up um so that's what i put his writings
and<00:01:14.299> um<00:01:15.680> it's<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:17.270> they<00:01:18.270> bring<00:01:18.479> together

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
and um it's there they bring together

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.730 
and um it's there they bring together
all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.340> raw<00:01:20.340> ingredients<00:01:20.930> such<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:21.960> RNA<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
all the raw ingredients such as RNA and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.390 
all the raw ingredients such as RNA and
amino<00:01:23.040> acids<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.150> proteins<00:01:25.790> bag<00:01:27.020> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.390 

let's<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> smooth<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.570> plastic<00:01:34.400> by

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
let's go to a smooth and a plastic by

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.569 
let's go to a smooth and a plastic by
here<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:37.280> um<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:39.570> lacks<00:01:39.930> ribosomes<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
here and um it lacks ribosomes and is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.350 
here and um it lacks ribosomes and is
responsible<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.299> lipid<00:01:42.829> synthesis<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
responsible for lipid synthesis and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
responsible for lipid synthesis and
processes<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.860> variety<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.700> tablet

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
processes a variety of the tablet

processes such as drug to talk

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
processes such as drug to talk
complication<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.149> she<00:01:54.149> hate<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
complication and she hate that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.030 
complication and she hate that
definition<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:56.070> this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.490 

um<00:02:02.480> let's<00:02:03.480> go<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:06.080> UM<00:02:07.610> rough<00:02:08.610> endoplasmic

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
um let's go to UM rough endoplasmic

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.080 
um let's go to UM rough endoplasmic
right<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.710> I<00:02:10.890> made<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.940> buttons

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
right here I made these little buttons

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.420 
right here I made these little buttons
and<00:02:12.590> said<00:02:13.590> they're<00:02:13.740> kind<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.400> know

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and said they're kind of like you know

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.730 
and said they're kind of like you know
ribosomes<00:02:16.459> um<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:20.450> has<00:02:21.450> lots<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.900> ribosomes<00:02:22.380> on

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
ribosomes um so has lots of ribosomes on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.160 
ribosomes um so has lots of ribosomes on
it<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.310> its<00:02:23.459> membrane<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.510> source<00:02:24.990> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it on its membrane and is source of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
it on its membrane and is source of
protein<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:29.360> now<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:32.060> help

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
protein so now I'm going to go to help

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.590 
protein so now I'm going to go to help
bring<00:02:36.140> everything<00:02:37.140> outside<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:39.420> pretty

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
bring everything outside it's pretty

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.430 
bring everything outside it's pretty
much<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.780> covers<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> whole<00:02:40.560> style<00:02:40.950> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
much what covers the whole style and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.900 
much what covers the whole style and
it's<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.680> arms<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.070> settle<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.400> protects<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
it's the arms of settle and protects it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.690 
it's the arms of settle and protects it
it<00:02:45.180> also<00:02:45.330> regulates<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.140> entry<00:02:46.709> or<00:02:47.010> exit<00:02:47.070> of

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
it also regulates the entry or exit of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.930 
it also regulates the entry or exit of
any<00:02:47.910> such<00:02:48.890> substances<00:02:51.080> um<00:02:52.100> let's<00:02:53.100> go<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.370> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
any such substances um let's go to this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:05.199 
any such substances um let's go to this
title<00:02:54.150> class<00:02:55.430> except<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:58.110> all<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
title class except it's all this and and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.840 
title class except it's all this and and
um<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.380> semi<00:03:10.709> fluid<00:03:11.100> substance<00:03:11.610> that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
um so it's a semi fluid substance that

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.570 
um so it's a semi fluid substance that
encases<00:03:12.330> or<00:03:12.720> cushions<00:03:13.410> organelles<00:03:14.070> to

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
encases or cushions organelles to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.840 
encases or cushions organelles to
protect<00:03:14.880> them<00:03:15.620> simples<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.799> let's<00:03:17.580> go<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
protect them simples that let's go to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:29.110 
protect them simples that let's go to
full<00:03:18.360> G

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.800 

right<00:03:29.690> here<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.760> used<00:03:32.269> for<00:03:32.510> stripping

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
right here and it is used for stripping

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.339 
right here and it is used for stripping
on<00:03:33.370> those<00:03:34.370> goods<00:03:34.700> created<00:03:35.090> by<00:03:35.239> the

on those goods created by the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.130 
on those goods created by the
endoplasmic<00:03:36.349> reticulum<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.659> ribosomes<00:03:38.659> to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.229 
endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes to
the<00:03:39.230> rest<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.830> cell<00:03:41.379> so<00:03:42.379> then<00:03:42.940> let's<00:03:43.940> try

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
the rest of the cell so then let's try

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:59.530 
the rest of the cell so then let's try
the<00:03:44.349> mitochondria<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:54.610> funny<00:03:55.610> power<00:03:57.310> grab<00:03:58.540> so

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the mitochondria and funny power grab so

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:09.130 
the mitochondria and funny power grab so
um<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:06.700> it's<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.000> site<00:04:08.239> for<00:04:08.599> cellular

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
um so on it's the site for cellular

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.559 
um so on it's the site for cellular
respiration<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.519> cell<00:04:10.730> basically<00:04:11.450> it

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
respiration of the cell basically it

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.750 
respiration of the cell basically it
makes<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.840> energy<00:04:12.200> for<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.530> cell<00:04:12.760> suppose

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
makes the energy for the cell suppose

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.810 
makes the energy for the cell suppose
that<00:04:13.790> let's<00:04:14.450> go<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.950> left<00:04:16.190> zones<00:04:16.489> which

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
that let's go to the left zones which

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.469 
that let's go to the left zones which
are<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> east<00:04:19.630> air<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:23.949> they<00:04:24.949> can<00:04:25.100> break<00:04:25.280> down

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
are the east air and they can break down

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.650 
are the east air and they can break down
macromolecules<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.900> keep<00:04:27.110> its<00:04:27.289> Esav<00:04:27.710> Mac

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660
