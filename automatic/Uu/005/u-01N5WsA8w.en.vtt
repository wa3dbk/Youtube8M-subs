you're gonna be folding them and

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.109 
you're gonna be folding them and
transforming<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.789> want<00:01:24.030> him

sliding a thing into and maybe even come
up<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:48.990> better<00:01:49.229> transformation<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
up with a better transformation then you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
up with a better transformation then you
want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> oh<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.109> little<00:01:52.350> piece<00:01:52.590> right

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
want to oh and this little piece right

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.010 
want to oh and this little piece right
here<00:01:52.859> anytime<00:01:53.639> you're<00:01:54.030> having<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.539> slide

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
here anytime you're having to slide

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
here anytime you're having to slide
these<00:01:55.409> little<00:01:55.740> pieces<00:01:55.859> you<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.249> have<00:01:56.429> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
these little pieces you might have to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
these little pieces you might have to
trim<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.289> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
trim it a little bit just so that it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.090 
trim it a little bit just so that it
fits<00:01:58.619> perfectly<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.659> then<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.319> slide<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
fits perfectly so then you slide it in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
fits perfectly so then you slide it in
there<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.149> folded<00:02:03.659> these<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:04.109> there<00:02:04.740> his

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there you folded these two there his
