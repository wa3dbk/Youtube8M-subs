00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.240
 after the 2010 moster episode 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.460
 hunter comes to you in a version 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 revised correct and in high definition 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.320
 more of these enemies e 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 lots of new equipment make it 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 moster hunter 3 complete the episode more 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.010
 rich of the capcom brand 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.230
 with a great multiplayer offline with 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 3ds is an evergreen online market 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.300
 never hunt monsters in company 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.300
 it was so satisfying 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 a lot of lantern is a real one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.830
 few commercial tornadoes in Japan 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 other games can boast of the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.740
 title of system seller like the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 capcom franchise 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.860
 but one should not be surprised if in 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 west to the mechanics are different e 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 much less fortunate with moster hunters 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 tri alternet we find ourselves in front of one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.680
 revised correct and expanded version of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.470
 monster hunter tri for wii come out 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the far 2010, an upgrade 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.430
 this that wants to benefit from the new 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.479
 nintendo hardware to take advantage of all 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.479
 peculiarities of wii u 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 the first sign of the new course on wii 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.910
 u is given by the choice to remove 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.800
 any type of screen interface 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.930
 that you can instead place on 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.370
 6 inch screen of the gamepad that of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 fact becomes a grid of 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.700
 panels to be filled with the many 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.980
 information available based on 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 need and situation the gamepad does not 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.910
 fails to quickly become one 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 information window allowing full 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.270
 customization of the indications that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.110
 you want to have quickly a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.060
 handy 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 this is only the first of many 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.690
 steps that the path of will have to take 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.340
 modernization made possible by 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.170
 nintendo hardware but the direction 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.190
 undertaken by capcom but it is without a doubt 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.050
 the right one 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.580
 at the content level we find all 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.040
 a new series of additions compared 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.410
 at the original exit a new bass from 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.959
 mint variants of old monsters areas 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.730
 other shots created from scratch a lot 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.440
 new equipment and hundreds of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.570
 this never seen make the offer of 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.250
 this very full-bodied palatable episode 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.440
 even for those who have already explored 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.360
 every corner of the tri on wii but what 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 it really shines is the relationship that binds 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.400
 wii ue 3ds the respective versions of 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.720
 monster hunter tri ultimate have been 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 created to allow a dialogue 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.560
 perfect between consoles with 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.120
 possibility to import backups e 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.160
 guild cards from a device 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
 to the other and continue the adventure without 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.850
 no continuity solution 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.650
 also with the April update 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.080
 it will be possible to play only with the gamepad 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 breaking away from the TV to close the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.010
 circle intervenes the possibility of 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 interface up to 3 3ds is a wii u 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.610
 for offline multiplayer sessions with 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.230
 four players 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.300
 online multiplayer is also 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.980
 virtually lag- free and offers one 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.980
 enviable connection stability 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.870
 from a purely visual point of view 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.519
 the 1080 native pixels anchored at 30 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 frames per second show one 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.760
 image cleaning without a doubt 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.800
 enough to forgive the many 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.629
 textures now visibly dated 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.150
 also making dynamic shadows stand out 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.340
 pixel shader and a total absence of e 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.319
 leasing the entertainment park remained 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.420
 almost unchanged thus maintaining up 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.610
 good frame rates of movement of the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.739
 hostile fauna but not rewriting the 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.870
 rules of interpenetration of non-bodies 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.459
 improved compared to the past 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.410
 the filters in the aquatic section 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.780
 they give apparently light 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.579
 more daring and compared to the free but it is alone 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 an impression well disguised from above 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.799
 resolution from most cleaning a 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.799
 screen 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.290
 born as an updated door of the third of 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.180
 2010 but star hunter tri ultimate e 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.430
 represents at interface level a 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.019
 real step forward for the series la 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.910
 new dimension added by the camp ed 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.349
 makes it very enjoyable to progress e 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.329
 gives a breath of fresh air 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.579
 to the gameplay approach than for too much 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.440
 time had remained unchanged is clear 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.180
 the capcom title does not offer a market 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.220
 technical difference compared to last year 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.750
 generation and a used eye 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.880
 he will not shout at the visual offer 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.979
 miracle despite the screen cleaning 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.630
 proposal did not face the impact 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.450
 who at the time had the title for wii 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.229
 but considered new additions to capcom has 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.229
 very little to complain
