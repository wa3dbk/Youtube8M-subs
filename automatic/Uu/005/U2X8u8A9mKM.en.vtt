00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
technology of a butterfly's wing so as

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
technology of a butterfly's wing so as
the<00:00:56.699> Sun<00:00:56.910> hits<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> like

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the Sun hits it it actually kind of like

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.040 
the Sun hits it it actually kind of like
fragments<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.100> light<00:00:59.309> through<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.329> an<00:01:00.539> air

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
fragments the light through like an air

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
fragments the light through like an air
chamber<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.949> would<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
chamber that would be like in like the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
chamber that would be like in like the
thin<00:01:03.239> filament<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> butterfly<00:01:04.199> wing<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
thin filament of the butterfly wing and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.100 
thin filament of the butterfly wing and
then<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> produces<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.519> color<00:01:06.000> display<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
then it produces a color display so the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
then it produces a color display so the
cool<00:01:07.650> thing<00:01:07.680> about<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> talk<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.520> going

into the music over here actually I wish

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.850 
into the music over here actually I wish
I<00:01:58.390> could<00:01:58.539> see<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:58.899> bit<00:01:59.110> better<00:01:59.259> if

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
I could see this a little bit better if

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
I could see this a little bit better if
I<00:02:00.009> double<00:02:00.310> tap<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:00.610> here<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.939> this<00:02:01.030> turns<00:02:01.240> on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
I double tap up here and this turns on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.820 
I double tap up here and this turns on
the<00:02:01.509> back<00:02:01.689> play<00:02:01.929> now<00:02:02.409> this<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.679> really

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
the back play now this is really

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.169 
the back play now this is really
aggressive<00:02:03.070> with<00:02:03.399> turning<00:02:03.670> off<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.909> screen

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
aggressive with turning off the screen

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.029 
aggressive with turning off the screen
because<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.600> display<00:02:04.929> on<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.590> gear<00:02:05.830> actually

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
because the display on the gear actually

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.639 
because the display on the gear actually
pulls<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.580> lot<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:07.119> power<00:02:07.630> whereas<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.259> Mirasol

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
pulls a lot of power whereas the Mirasol

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.210 
pulls a lot of power whereas the Mirasol
display<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.759> under<00:02:10.030> half<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.420> watt<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:12.040> one

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
display is like under half a watt so one

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.949 
display is like under half a watt so one
of<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> things<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.790> do<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:13.810> not

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
of the things that I do like this is not

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.960 
of the things that I do like this is not
connected<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> thing<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.670> this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
connected but the thing is is that this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.090 
connected but the thing is is that this
is<00:02:16.180> saying<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.600> connected<00:02:17.110> as<00:02:17.230> well<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
is saying not connected as well but the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.620 
is saying not connected as well but the
big<00:02:18.280> difference<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.330> comes

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
big difference is is that this comes

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.330 
big difference is is that this comes
with<00:02:19.780> four<00:02:20.080> gigabytes<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.860> on-board<00:02:21.069> storage

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
with four gigabytes of on-board storage

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.839 
with four gigabytes of on-board storage
and<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.209> comes<00:02:22.420> with<00:02:22.560> 412<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.610> let's

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
and this comes with 412 so let's

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.869 
and this comes with 412 so let's
oh<00:02:26.170> there<00:02:27.170> we<00:02:27.319> go<00:02:27.469> sorry<00:02:27.829> about<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.700> then

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
oh there we go sorry about that and then

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.670 
oh there we go sorry about that and then
here<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.209> go<00:02:29.359> back<00:02:29.629> into<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.959> music<00:02:30.079> now<00:02:30.530> when

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
here we go back into the music now when

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.489 
here we go back into the music now when
it<00:02:30.799> comes<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.569> different<00:02:32.569> things<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.170> saying

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:33.499 
it comes to different things like saying

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.520 
it comes to different things like saying
calendar<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:34.939> has<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.450> interesting

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
calendar this has a really interesting

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.550 
calendar this has a really interesting

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
actually if we go back here and then we

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.530 
actually if we go back here and then we
swipe<00:02:39.889> through<00:02:40.249> there's<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> whole<00:02:41.329> bunch<00:02:41.420> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
swipe through there's a whole bunch of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.059 
swipe through there's a whole bunch of
different<00:02:41.659> clock<00:02:42.019> phases<00:02:42.439> that<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.889> use

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
different clock phases that we can use

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.619 
different clock phases that we can use
and<00:02:43.280> some<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.730> them<00:02:43.849> are<00:02:43.969> actually<00:02:44.150> just

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
and some of them are actually just

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.780 
and some of them are actually just
integrated<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.560> with<00:02:45.920> your<00:02:46.159> calendars

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
integrated in with your calendars

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.539

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
setting so there's one with just a stock

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.979 
setting so there's one with just a stock
price<00:02:49.819> there<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.389> we'll<00:02:50.480> turn<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.810> backlight

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
price there and we'll turn the backlight

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.170 
price there and we'll turn the backlight
on<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.919> it's<00:02:52.010> easier<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.609> see<00:02:52.909> there

thinner<00:05:22.039> than<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:23.270> Samsung<00:05:23.659> Galaxy<00:05:23.810> gear<00:05:24.289> and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
thinner than the Samsung Galaxy gear and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.070 
thinner than the Samsung Galaxy gear and
one<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.800> reasons<00:05:25.219> why<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.879> is<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.750> that

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
one of the reasons why that is is that

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.689 
one of the reasons why that is is that
Qualcomm<00:05:27.409> has<00:05:27.589> actually<00:05:28.009> put<00:05:28.189> the<00:05:28.310> battery

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
Qualcomm has actually put the battery

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.149 
Qualcomm has actually put the battery
down<00:05:29.089> in<00:05:29.330> here<00:05:29.719> which<00:05:30.199> actually<00:05:30.560> reduces<00:05:30.710> the

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
down in here which actually reduces the

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.629 
down in here which actually reduces the
thickness<00:05:31.729> of<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.569> watch<00:05:33.139> itself<00:05:33.680> now<00:05:34.339> if<00:05:34.520> we

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
thickness of the watch itself now if we

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.640 
thickness of the watch itself now if we
look<00:05:34.759> at<00:05:34.909> the<00:05:35.150> power<00:05:35.719> consumption<00:05:36.199> on<00:05:36.289> both<00:05:36.469> of

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
look at the power consumption on both of

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.589 
look at the power consumption on both of
these<00:05:36.770> devices<00:05:37.159> they<00:05:37.909> are<00:05:38.060> quite<00:05:38.360> different

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
these devices they are quite different

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.189 
these devices they are quite different
this<00:05:38.930> has<00:05:38.990> an<00:05:39.439> m3<00:05:39.680> processor<00:05:40.360> below<00:05:41.360> 300

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
this has an m3 processor below 300

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.350 
this has an m3 processor below 300
minutes<00:05:42.379> I<00:05:42.710> believe<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.580> has<00:05:43.819> a<00:05:43.849> single

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
minutes I believe and this has a single

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.339 
minutes I believe and this has a single
core<00:05:44.689> processor<00:05:45.560> that's<00:05:46.000> 800<00:05:47.000> megahertz<00:05:47.349> and

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
core processor that's 800 megahertz and

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.089 
core processor that's 800 megahertz and
the<00:05:48.500> other<00:05:48.620> thing<00:05:48.889> about<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.300> Galaxy<00:05:50.300> gear<00:05:51.099> so

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
the other thing about the Galaxy gear so

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.679 
the other thing about the Galaxy gear so
they've<00:05:52.580> got<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.819> battery<00:05:53.089> in<00:05:53.180> here<00:05:53.210> but

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
they've got the battery in here but

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.719 
they've got the battery in here but
there<00:05:54.080> that's<00:05:54.560> actually<00:05:54.949> a<00:05:54.979> microphone<00:05:55.520> so

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
there that's actually a microphone so

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.550 
there that's actually a microphone so
you<00:05:55.789> can<00:05:55.939> hold<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.449> up<00:05:56.629> to<00:05:56.870> your<00:05:56.990> ear<00:05:57.319> and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
you can hold this up to your ear and

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.529 
you can hold this up to your ear and
kind<00:05:57.949> of<00:05:58.009> talking<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.580> your<00:05:58.669> wrist<00:05:58.939> and<00:05:59.300> like

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
kind of talking to your wrist and like

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.260 
kind of talking to your wrist and like
your<00:05:59.899> Dick<00:06:00.259> Tracy<00:06:00.620> which<00:06:01.490> is<00:06:01.610> always<00:06:01.939> a<00:06:01.969> good

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
your Dick Tracy which is always a good

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.070 
your Dick Tracy which is always a good
thing<00:06:03.159> so<00:06:04.159> that's<00:06:04.370> just<00:06:04.520> been<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.969> quick<00:06:05.509> look

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
thing so that's just been a quick look

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.439 
thing so that's just been a quick look
