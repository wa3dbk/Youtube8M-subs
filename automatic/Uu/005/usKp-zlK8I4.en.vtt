 Nice simple lady's Korean friend 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.750
 Pick up an ipod touch on amazon, 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 I don't know how to use it... 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.370
 『&amp;)*(()@』 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.070
 fortunately! 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.600
 Good simple lady is a professional computer worker. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290
 Of course, such a small matter can’t help her. 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.390
 Let the simple lady come to help me! 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.600
 First of all, take a good ipod touch 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.800
 Then, choose a computer you like. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.610
 Attention! Because the ipod will recognize the computer, 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.750
 So at the beginning, try to choose a computer that you used to use! 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.090
 After selecting the computer, take out the transmission line attached to the inner box. 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.250
 Connect ipod touch to the computer~ 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.600
 After connecting to the computer, if you have itunes installed in your computer, 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.490
 It will automatically jump out, if not, 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.210
 You can go to the Internet to search for downloads. 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 Press Continue to see a copy of the Terms and Conditions 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.160
 Mainly remind you 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.140
 To use ipod touch, you must agree to Apple's software license agreement, 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.900
 Apple's notifications, GoogleMaps, and Youtube terms and conditions, 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.330
 After pressing the agreement, iTune will help you connect to the Apple store. 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.150
 If you already have an Apple account, you can log in directly. 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.400
 If not, click "I don't have an Apple ID" below to register a new account. 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.660
 The Apple Store lets you download and purchase apps, and music online. 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.760
 Next, I will jump out of the Apple ID terms again. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.600
 Because some apps in the Apple Store are paid for, 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 So you definitely need credit card authentication, if you don't have a credit card, 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.600
 Then you can't apply for an Apple ID from here. 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.550
 So first prepare your credit card and let go~ 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 Then, fill in your email, password, and prompt to create your password. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:50.400
 Next, register your credit card details and billing address. 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.500
 Note that all input requirements for the Apple Store require English input. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.000
 So people who don’t know their English address, 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:10.300
 You can go to the China Post website to search for online translation functions. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.500
 Now that you have the Apple ID, log in to your account password. 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.100
 , continue to complete your ipod touch registration, after filling out the basic information, 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.600
 It will ask what you are doing? How old is the main user of this ipod? 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.200
 And it is your first few ipods, press submit after filling it out! 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 After picking up the name for your ipod, 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.300
 It is recommended that you do not tick the three options for automatically syncing songs, videos, photos, and apps. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.940
 Otherwise, next time you connect to the computer, 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.450
 The computer will automatically sync the data imported into itunes to the ipod touch. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.100
 It’s possible to squirt your ipod touch casually without feeling embarrassed! 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.440
 Congratulations! Your installation steps have been completed two-thirds~ 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.700
 Next, you will enter the page that will appear every time you connect to the ipod. 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.530
 You can see the labels with different types of data on it. 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.050
 You can choose which information you want to sync to ipod touch under each tab. 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.030
 Next, prepare to put the song on the ipod touch! 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.700
 If you put your music CD in the drive, 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.550
 Itunes will automatically ask if you need to import music into itunes. 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.000
 If you want to import the music files from your computer into the itunes database, 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.900
 Just click on the file in the menu above, and then select the database. 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.820
 After putting the song into Itunes, 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.900
 You can see that there are a lot of music materials you have imported into the music label in the ipod. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750
 You can choose whether you want to sync the entire folder, or just sync the data you have checked. 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.100
 The current capacity of ipod touch will be displayed immediately below. After confirming, 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.600
 Press Apply below to apply, iTunes will start syncing! 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.280
