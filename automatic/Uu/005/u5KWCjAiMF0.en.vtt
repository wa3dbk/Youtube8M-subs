00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 virtual academy website for free 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.740
 selection of tutors presents 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.110
 all our assignments of 6 avoiding are considered 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.289
 the most difficult task and snow 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:28.199
 solve the integer equation 6 x 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.480
 square plus 5y square is 74 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 pay attention to that and 1 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.830
 addendum 6x to from and second 5y square 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.339
 non-negative they equal give in 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:49.449
 the sum of 74 is a positive number go here 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:50.260
 final enumeration here by example y y 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.190
 playboy 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:01:00.430
 there can be no 4 see 4 in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:05.830
 a square of 16 5 on 16 already 80 left for 74 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.229
 well if strictly speaking the module y should 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.990
 be less than four but it will be about 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:19.830
 integers does not exceed 3 that is, the module y 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:27.460
 in principle, can take values ​​0 1 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:32.650
 2 and 3 let us say at once that y cannot be 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 Odd see if y is odd then y 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.570
 square, too, odd 5 times 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.210
 odd gives an odd number and thanks 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.930
 coefficient 6 the first term is always 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.090
 even 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.170
 even plus odd 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:55.780
 can be 74 means we strike out 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.039
 Odd igryki that further further simply 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.960
 arrange perigord 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:07.030
 if the module y equals inflated we get 6 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.729
 x square is 74 and it is clear that y 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:16.060
 there is no this equation 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:19.299
 why because 74 are not divisible by 6 well 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.640
 and the last option is the y module 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:28.690
 equals 2 so we get that 6 x 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:34.450
 the square here will be twenty five on 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:41.290
 four leveled 74 6 x square 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:47.890
 equals 50 4x square equals 9 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:50.430
 that is, the modulus x is equal to three and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.579
 we get the system 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:01.299
 module x is 3 module y is two 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:04.389
 it is clear that the modulus x is equal to three if x 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.900
 either 3 or minus 3 modulus y equals 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:14.730
 two if y or 2 or -2 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 that is, you get 4 pairs of solutions answer 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:28.820
 32 pair 3 minus 2 pair 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:35.600
 Ninos 32 and nose pairs 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.500
 3 is not two and so the equation has 4 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.010
 solutions 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.180
 and we have two unknown equations 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:48.800
 so the solution is this pair 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.330
 34 solutions and axes 32 3 minus 2 minus 3 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.100
 2 and minus 3 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.100
 no luck that's all
