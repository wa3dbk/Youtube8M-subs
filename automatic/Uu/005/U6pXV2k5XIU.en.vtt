okay what we're going to do today is
just<00:00:02.730> do<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> quick<00:00:03.210> demo<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.810> Revere<00:00:04.110> rock

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
just do a quick demo of the Revere rock

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.320 
just do a quick demo of the Revere rock
crusher<00:00:04.710> attenuator<00:00:05.279> now<00:00:05.700> mainly<00:00:06.000> because<00:00:06.180> I

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
crusher attenuator now mainly because I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.870 
crusher attenuator now mainly because I
couldn't<00:00:06.569> find<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:06.960> many<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.730> this<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
couldn't find that many and this is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.160 
couldn't find that many and this is
something<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> would<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.719> liked<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.870> see

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
something that I would have liked to see

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.890 
something that I would have liked to see
before<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.500> bought<00:00:10.679> it

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
before I bought it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.299

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
no output at all and we're going to be

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.330 
no output at all and we're going to be
playing<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> through<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> Rivera<00:00:58.710> que<00:00:59.039> trae

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

through a Les Paul style guitars played
a<00:01:10.770> quick<00:01:11.010> riff<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> looper<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.240> we're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
a quick riff in the looper and we're

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.499 
a quick riff in the looper and we're
going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.320> play<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.509> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
going to use that to play all the all

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.679 
going to use that to play all the all
the<00:01:15.720> demo<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> everything's<00:01:17.520> kept<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.970> even<00:01:18.600> as

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the demo so everything's kept as even as

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
the demo so everything's kept as even as
we<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.619> mics<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> caddy

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
we can the mics going to be a caddy

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570 
we can the mics going to be a caddy
100's<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
100's which is just kind of a like I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.469 
100's which is just kind of a like I
like<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> scale<00:01:26.180> we're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
like on this scale we're going to be

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
like on this scale we're going to be
going<00:01:27.630> through<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> focus<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.570> 1<00:01:30.840> with

going through a focus right is a 1 with

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.020 
going through a focus right is a 1 with
the<00:01:31.950> digital<00:01:32.250> card<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:32.939> be

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the digital card and this will be

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
the digital card and this will be
plugged<00:01:33.299> straight<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.900> computer<00:01:34.320> via

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
plugged straight into the computer via

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
plugged straight into the computer via
the<00:01:34.740> optical<00:01:35.579> output<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.170> we're<00:01:37.259> going

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the optical output and what we're going

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
the optical output and what we're going
to<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.590> at<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.850> studio<00:01:39.180> mode<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to do at the end is the studio mode and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.289 
to do at the end is the studio mode and
Max<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> 30<00:01:40.619> decibel<00:01:41.100> cut<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.180> we're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
Max is about a 30 decibel cut so we're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.469 
Max is about a 30 decibel cut so we're
just<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> hit<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> plus<00:01:43.740> 30<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
just going to hit the plus 30 and the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.340 
just going to hit the plus 30 and the
mic<00:01:45.659> pre<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> quick<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.570> B<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
mic pre so we can get a quick a B at the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.180 
mic pre so we can get a quick a B at the
same<00:01:49.500> volume<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> difference<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.820> tone
