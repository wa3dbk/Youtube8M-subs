00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:12.780
 The Reunification 2009 has moved to the Democratic Party 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:20.300
 Business sorting Eco point Eco car tax reduction and policy different from before are launched one after another 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:24.470
 Reduction of CO2 emissions by 25% was also promised by the international community 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.990
 So right now the world is more severe 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.990
 I'm heading to an era of energy saving eco 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.580
 Actual implementation of subsidies and eco-points 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 Activities for a clean and clean society began 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:47.160
 Reducing co2 by 25% would reduce emissions by more than 30% compared to 2005 emissions 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 Is not something that can be easily achieved 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 A variety of industry in hybrid car the electric vehicles such as power generation using solar and wind power 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 We are working on further efforts for energy saving 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.909
 And the industry sector where the effort was a big success 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.520
 Co2 emissions from the transport sector have started greatly reduces directly below 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.520
 In out of the Hata body co2 What about 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.100
 Compared to 1990, the 2008 data shows a decrease or an increase of about 35% 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.909
 I am 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.980
 This means that as the target of family and personal life in the future co2 reduction and energy conservation Ministry 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.480
 It is predicted that resource conversion will be strongly demanded 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.970
 Among them, bold reform of housing 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.060
 And you suddenly been promoted 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 The speed was advanced at a stretch 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.380
 It will be able to imagine if the popularization of high-definition television is remembered 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.000
 The total number of households in the whole country is about 5000 masse 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.500
 So what is the form of housing in an eco-friendly era ? 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.850
 The answer is all electrification 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 However, Japan's electrified housing is not so close to about 2.9 million homes and about 50 million total homes 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:19.410
 Only 6% inside 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:21.490
 In other words you 47 million households more than 90% are using the still bitter froze the way this is half 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.870
 Alden advanced for centuries 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:35.620
 It's very late compared to the 80% penetration rate of Europe I worked on 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.890
 And in Japan, we are sleeping 90% or more for the age of all electrification that finally began 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:44.350
 Market is beginning to move 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.360
 The number of all electrification installations has already tripled since 2005 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.450
 Lee of the increase is not only environmental issues 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.860
 Actually the most common cause of fire is 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 The coming fire 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:04.020
 The cookware in an all-electric home does not use fire, which reduces the risk of fire . 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:12.420
 It is ih cookware that has increased sales so 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.520
 The market , which was 83.5 billion yen in 2006, will increase by 38% in 2010 to 15 billion yen 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.390
 became 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.770
 But this i1 cookware 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:27.709
 The health effects of Benzi and the difficulty of using cooking clothes 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.360
 Many people already have a big drawback that bothering you to need a dedicated pot 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:37.110
 Will know 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:43.220
 Therefore, as the next generation cookware that solved the hemothorax of such gas and ih cookware 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.220
 It is superradient heater that is attracting attention in the market 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.910
 The features of the Super Radiant Heater 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.910
 Although it is only about 40% , cooking at about 75% efficiency compared to the thermal efficiency of the sky 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.020
 Can 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.010
 High thermal efficiency shortens cooking time 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.480
 You can turn off the switch and cook the remaining heat so the electricity bill is also cheap 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.480
 Very eco and economical 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.109
 You don't have to buy it on purpose 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.720
 Hey all-if the bottom of the pot is what flat 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:24.020
 Safety design which does not energize only by pushing the thermal power adjustment knob 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.120
 The sensor works automatically even if you forget to erase 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.889
 Switch 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:38.270
 The electromagnetic radiation emitted from super radiant heater clears international safety standard 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:39.400
 Because 1 of about 500 70 minutes of what and ih heater use also peace of mind important your family 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.410
 I will 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.600
 In addition, the thermal effect by the far infrared radiation function makes the material quick 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.320
 You can cook without unevenness 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:56.790
 Nutrients are included to minimize molecules such as juice and vegetables that bleed from the water ingredients needed for cooking 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.790
 It becomes easy to be embroidered 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:09.710
 Such super radiant heater's ability has been highly praised by many professionals 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:15.200
 The biggest feature of that Lajette heater is that it does not allow grease 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.880
 In that it does not join the oil is that it is less likely to oxidize the body in what I ate 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.330
 but 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.500
 I think you can already cook in a different dimension 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.820
 Cooking technology 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.250
 I feel like I can come by machine 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:35.890
 Anyway, if you use this, you can cook delicious food even if you are not good at cooking 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:39.100
 Of One we are going to introduce as much as possible to many people because I would like you to make a happy dishes 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.220
 We have been introduced in the state etc. 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.280
 When I was heating with 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.449
 Oh 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.100
 In short, the two straight colored Oy cis taste 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.080
 More you know then is dependent on there that 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.190
 It's not Gacha Te Easy Saku 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.550
 If you can see the car color already it feels dry even if it is easy to understand 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.800
 It recovers to the gennt a little while burning us 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.099
 Smet is close 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.490
 After all human beings should say that the original 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.889
 Ness game 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:21.240
 I feel like I was back there 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:27.810
 Stickiness of oil from that after all is boiling over Toka then ventilation fan in the case of number 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:33.830
 If this is also a very troubled item and it is usual, just wipe with Motown 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:40.910
 If it is not necessary to use detergent, it will be clean with this stand 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:44.780
 And that's because I'm going to disappear into that nature too 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.960
 Is it the harm of the electromagnetic wave of ih? 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.190
 I was looking at whether the rare the sea 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.480
 So 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:57.950
 Ichida I thought that I didn't want to go anywhere 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:02.750
 Originally when I built a house, i wanted to add a heater 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:08.409
 But ih heater is bad for the body 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:13.120
 Because mon electromagnetic waves had heard it is Toka not good things like that 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:16.810
 What went evil Yamato I was wondering if I do not want to put 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.000
 You can use it with peace of mind 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:24.270
 Do it therefore being said there is a kind of heater 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.040
 Japan is the only reason why it is popular 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:35.020
 America and Europe, etc. Rain and heaters are mainstream 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:40.830
 So when I was told that only Japan is using such ih 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:44.250
 I say I think I was now very way I Nonakara Nekou something 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:51.000
 It is dangerous because it is nuclear power plant and so on 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:57.050
 Really the Tteyuu wish or can use with confidence Once Tsu only minus the still al people in that time 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.990
 I 'm cooking while thinking that I'm good with this which was good every day already 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.990
 A man and a heat for me 

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:06.529
 It is a must-have
