00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
 since five years 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.250
 so where is the tile 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.970
 when she was in the hospital 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.099
 on the way to turkey 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.249
 there are two pillars 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.019
 what are you doing 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.089
 Los Angeles 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.089
 the Koran 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 the group of tours 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.580
 moreover the whole country 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.150
 for many others 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 he 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.480
 league 2 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 who are they 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 Blues 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 all are too hot 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.510
 the boss of the ump 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.510
 maybe the opole element 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 because it also proposes I do not understand why this statement 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 the woman who makes 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 this team 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.640
 in the meantime, so give English 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 for February in tobin 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.620
 yes but to get there it appears 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 instead of May 8 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 at his feet 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.290
 2% 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 your choice 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.799
 in this group 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.569
 all for all 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.119
 so that makes you 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.119
 his goal of course on lightning edf 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.509
 the song 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.949
 apps for his clients 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.149
 usually on the pieces the t-shirts 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.109
 for me I could test 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:30.789
 it's their right
