point<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.500> show<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.719> DX

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
point of that show you know you have DX

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
point of that show you know you have DX

rock<00:00:51.140> those<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.949> WB<00:00:53.460> title<00:00:53.760> match

those<00:00:54.360> 30<00:00:55.230> s<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.730> pretty<00:00:56.730> much<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> show

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
those 30 s for pretty much what the show

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
those 30 s for pretty much what the show
is<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> built<00:00:58.079> around<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.570> guess

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
is going to be built around and I guess

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
is going to be built around and I guess
the<00:01:00.750> high<00:01:00.899> points<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.739> show<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.340> see

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the high points of that show I can see

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.780 
the high points of that show I can see
one<00:01:02.760> opening<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> show<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> obviously

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
one opening the show which is obviously

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.740 
one opening the show which is obviously
dx1<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.320> nine<00:01:07.320> o<00:01:07.350> clock<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.360> being

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
dx1 at nine o clock I can see that being

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.910 
dx1 at nine o clock I can see that being
the<00:01:10.170> rock<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.240> third<00:01:12.450> hour<00:01:12.710> will<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the rock and then the third hour will be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.929 
the rock and then the third hour will be
the<00:01:14.700> W<00:01:15.299> title<00:01:15.630> match<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> course<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.759> think

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the W title match and of course I think

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
the W title match and of course I think
Brock<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> interrupt<00:01:18.689> DX<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.740> that's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
Brock is going to interrupt DX so that's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.960 
Brock is going to interrupt DX so that's
pretty<00:01:20.100> much<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> start<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
pretty much going to be at the start of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
pretty much going to be at the start of
the<00:01:21.060> show<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> guess<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.890> can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the show so I guess you can see I can

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
the show so I guess you can see I can
pretty<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.570> predict<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> top<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pretty much predict at the top of the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
pretty much predict at the top of the
hour<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> end<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.490> each<00:01:26.670> hour<00:01:26.880> you're

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
hour or the end of each hour you're

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.819 
hour or the end of each hour you're
going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.689> big<00:01:27.960> thing<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:30.180> i

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
going to get one big thing and that i

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.870 
going to get one big thing and that i
think<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> Rock<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.780> great

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
think the Rock will be in a great

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.170 
think the Rock will be in a great
storyline<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:37.100> build<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.520> foundation

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
storyline that will build the foundation

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
storyline that will build the foundation
for<00:01:39.210> something<00:01:39.780> big<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.530> happen<00:01:40.710> very

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
for something big that will happen very

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
for something big that will happen very
soon<00:01:41.430> whether<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.750> SummerSlam<00:01:43.020> which

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
soon whether it be at SummerSlam which

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
soon whether it be at SummerSlam which
is<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.490> highly<00:01:44.820> doubtful<00:01:45.180> considering

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
is kind of highly doubtful considering

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
is kind of highly doubtful considering
there's<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.930> three<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.350> four<00:01:46.590> weeks<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
there's only three or four weeks of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
there's only three or four weeks of
build<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> raw<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
build I think if they want the raw to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
build I think if they want the raw to
really<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.710> something<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.430> should<00:01:50.670> build<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
really do something they should build it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
really do something they should build it
up<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:52.140> great<00:01:52.799> amount<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.399> people

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
up a great amount to make people

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
up a great amount to make people
actually<00:01:53.970> interested<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.049> again

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
actually interested in it but then again

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.749 
actually interested in it but then again
it<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> rock<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> people<00:01:56.189> will<00:01:56.310> watch<00:01:56.520> no

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it is the rock and people will watch no

ring whether it be for a promo for a

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.910 
ring whether it be for a promo for a
match<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.870> unbelievable<00:04:01.440> i<00:04:01.560> was<00:04:01.739> there

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.400 
match it is unbelievable i was there
live<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.660> was<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.810> for<00:04:03.870> wrestlemania<00:04:04.380> 27<00:04:04.829> and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
live I was there for wrestlemania 27 and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.740 
live I was there for wrestlemania 27 and
28<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:08.040> was<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:09.030> were<00:04:09.060> waiting<00:04:09.540> for

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
28 it was like you were waiting for

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.420 
28 it was like you were waiting for
those<00:04:10.170> two<00:04:10.410> did<00:04:10.620> have<00:04:10.829> some<00:04:11.100> sort<00:04:11.340> of

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
those two did have some sort of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.940 
those two did have some sort of
interaction<00:04:11.820> with<00:04:12.120> each<00:04:12.150> other<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.650> think

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
interaction with each other so I think

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.120 
interaction with each other so I think
that<00:04:14.250> W<00:04:14.790> will<00:04:15.060> capitalize<00:04:15.570> on<00:04:15.600> this<00:04:15.900> and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
that W will capitalize on this and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.620 
that W will capitalize on this and
leaving<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.400> rock<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.850> John<00:04:18.060> Cena<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.510> do
