00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
doesn't have Bluetooth or a microphone
or<00:00:24.269> anything<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.840> included<00:00:25.699> which<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
or anything like that included which is

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.220 
or anything like that included which is
OK<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.599> that's<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.930> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
OK for me because that's not really

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.820 
OK for me because that's not really
something<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.189> need<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> use<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
something that I need to use but a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.260 
something that I need to use but a
pretty<00:00:31.830> good<00:00:31.949> unit<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:32.969> easy<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty good unit the it was easy to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
pretty good unit the it was easy to
install<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:34.020> got<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> from<00:00:34.559> Crutchfield<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
install I got it from Crutchfield so it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.950 
install I got it from Crutchfield so it
came<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.899> some<00:00:36.899> pretty<00:00:37.079> good<00:00:37.230> instructions

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
came with some pretty good instructions

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
came with some pretty good instructions
even<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.200> someone<00:00:40.559> who<00:00:41.129> hasn't<00:00:41.430> installed

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
even for someone who hasn't installed

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
even for someone who hasn't installed
units<00:00:42.570> before<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:43.829> straightforward

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
units before it's pretty straightforward

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
units before it's pretty straightforward
the<00:00:44.910> most<00:00:45.120> time-consuming<00:00:45.329> part<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.230> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the most time-consuming part is just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
the most time-consuming part is just
doing<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> wiring<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> follow<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
doing the wiring but if you follow the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
doing the wiring but if you follow the
directions<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:50.190> pretty<00:00:50.399> easy<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.059> only

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
directions it's pretty easy the only

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.700 
directions it's pretty easy the only
thing<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.899> about<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.469> unit

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
thing that I don't like about this unit

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.790 
thing that I don't like about this unit
is<00:00:56.010> probably<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.820> input<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> USB<00:00:58.289> which

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is probably the input for the USB which

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
is probably the input for the USB which
is<00:00:58.980> located<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> back<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> unit

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
is located at the back of the unit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.140 
is located at the back of the unit
Pioneer<00:01:01.500> gives<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:03.199> USB<00:01:04.199> cable<00:01:04.439> included

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
Pioneer gives you a USB cable included

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
Pioneer gives you a USB cable included
but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> would<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.930> preferred<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.650> has

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
but I would have preferred one that has

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
but I would have preferred one that has
an<00:01:08.310> input<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> front<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> unit<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
an input at the front of the unit just

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
an input at the front of the unit just
plug<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.460> flash<00:01:11.700> drive<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.590> something<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
plug in a flash drive or something like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
plug in a flash drive or something like
that<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.060> big<00:01:15.240> deal<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that but it's not really a big deal I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
that but it's not really a big deal I
don't<00:01:16.500> keep<00:01:16.710> anything<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.280> phone<00:01:17.520> anyway

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
don't keep anything on my phone anyway

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
don't keep anything on my phone anyway
it's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.509> she's<00:01:19.140> mp3<00:01:19.650> CDs<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.310> Oh<00:01:22.670> give<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.820> an

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
idea here's how this looks that pretty

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
idea here's how this looks that pretty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
graphics there's a way to do that down

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:03.590 
graphics there's a way to do that down
here<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.410> go<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.800> different<00:01:54.040> colors

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.720 

one<00:02:04.600> that's<00:02:04.780> gonna<00:02:04.930> cycle<00:02:05.410> through<00:02:05.680> all<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
one that's gonna cycle through all the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.210 
one that's gonna cycle through all the
different<00:02:06.910> colors<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:10.470> kind<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.530> cool<00:02:11.710> but<00:02:12.160> I

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
different colors just kind of cool but I

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.870 
different colors just kind of cool but I
usually<00:02:13.860> keep<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.010> all<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.220> color<00:02:15.460> in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
usually keep it all in color in

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.940 
usually keep it all in color in
different<00:02:16.210> backgrounds<00:02:17.050> there's<00:02:17.530> even<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.830> way

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
different backgrounds there's even a way

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:27.440 
different backgrounds there's even a way
to<00:02:17.980> upload<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:18.610> own<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.330> pretty<00:02:25.960> cool

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to upload your own so pretty cool

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.520 
to upload your own so pretty cool
usually<00:02:28.450> looks<00:02:28.630> good<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.350> just

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
usually looks good and this is just

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
usually looks good and this is just
background<00:02:29.710> colors<00:02:30.340> right<00:02:30.520> here<00:02:33.570> pretty<00:02:34.570> cool

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
background colors right here pretty cool

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.280 
background colors right here pretty cool
stuff

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
stuff

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.880 
stuff
yeah<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.130> like<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.340> said<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.910> basic

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
yeah but like I said it's just the basic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.350 
yeah but like I said it's just the basic
I'm<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.250> other<00:02:39.370> models<00:02:39.760> come<00:02:39.940> with<00:02:39.970> some

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I'm sure the other models come with some

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.440 
I'm sure the other models come with some
different<00:02:40.690> features<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:42.730> has<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.209> mix

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
different features this one has the mix

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.860 
different features this one has the mix
