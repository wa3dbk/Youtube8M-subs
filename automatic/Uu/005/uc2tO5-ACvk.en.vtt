this<00:00:20.600> is<00:00:20.900> very<00:00:21.289> interesting<00:00:21.650> because<00:00:21.920> it<00:00:22.550> uses

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
this is very interesting because it uses

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.740 
this is very interesting because it uses
the<00:00:23.150> fate<00:00:23.539> engine<00:00:24.140> now<00:00:24.590> fate<00:00:25.010> is<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:26.000> cold

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
the fate engine now fate is really cold

I<00:00:27.080> don't<00:00:27.110> want<00:00:27.350> to<00:00:27.410> call<00:00:27.530> it<00:00:27.560> cutting<00:00:27.920> edge

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
I don't want to call it cutting edge

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.320 
I don't want to call it cutting edge
because<00:00:28.369> it's<00:00:28.490> been<00:00:28.610> around<00:00:28.789> for<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.060> very<00:00:29.210> long

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
because it's been around for a very long

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.409 
because it's been around for a very long
time<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.529> really<00:00:30.970> revolutionized<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.180> lot

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
time but it really revolutionized a lot

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.420 
time but it really revolutionized a lot
of<00:00:32.570> ideas<00:00:33.109> on<00:00:33.379> how<00:00:33.410> role-playing<00:00:34.070> was<00:00:34.219> done

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
of ideas on how role-playing was done

somebody<00:00:34.730> once<00:00:35.060> called<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.390> indy<00:00:35.750> before<00:00:36.110> indy

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
somebody once called it indy before indy

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.319 
somebody once called it indy before indy
was<00:00:36.530> cool<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.430> kind<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:37.790> have<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.090> agree

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
was cool and I kind of have to agree

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.510 
was cool and I kind of have to agree
with<00:00:38.480> them<00:00:38.630> on<00:00:38.720> that<00:00:38.780> because<00:00:39.140> this<00:00:39.620> does<00:00:40.340> away

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
with them on that because this does away

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.370 
with them on that because this does away
with<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.880> lot<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.329> standard<00:00:41.899> things<00:00:42.170> you

with a lot of the standard things you
think<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.890> when<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.100> think<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.430> a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
think of when you think of a

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.250 
think of when you think of a
role-playing<00:00:43.970> game<00:00:44.059> I'll<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.079> engine

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
role-playing game I'll get to the engine

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.930 
role-playing game I'll get to the engine
in<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.770> few<00:00:45.950> minutes<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.370> want<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.640> talk<00:00:46.760> about

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
in a few minutes I want to talk about

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.600 
in a few minutes I want to talk about
the<00:00:47.210> setting<00:00:47.630> first<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.860> setting<00:00:49.250> for<00:00:49.430> this

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
the setting first the setting for this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.240 
the setting first the setting for this
is<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.850> pulp<00:00:50.329> era<00:00:50.630> game<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.530> 20s<00:00:52.070> it

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
is a pulp era game in the 20s it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.950 
is a pulp era game in the 20s it
specifically<00:00:52.760> puts<00:00:53.059> itself<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> 20s

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
specifically puts itself in the 20s

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.910 
specifically puts itself in the 20s
although<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.379> could<00:00:54.530> pretty<00:00:54.680> easily

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
although there you could pretty easily

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.770 
although there you could pretty easily
expand<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.550> into<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.940> 30s<00:00:56.210> if<00:00:56.450> you<00:00:56.540> really

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
expand it into the 30s if you really

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.810 
expand it into the 30s if you really
wanted<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.170> into<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> more<00:00:57.770> traditional<00:00:58.219> pulp

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
genres this blends it all in together

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.800 
genres this blends it all in together
it's<00:01:15.560> rather<00:01:15.770> reminiscent<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.700> white<00:01:17.390> Wolf's

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's rather reminiscent of white Wolf's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.530 
it's rather reminiscent of white Wolf's
adventure<00:01:18.470> game<00:01:18.799> on<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.340> respect<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:20.000> that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
adventure game on that respect in that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.820 
adventure game on that respect in that
it<00:01:20.659> really<00:01:20.780> allows<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.380> bring<00:01:21.530> all<00:01:21.740> of

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
it really allows you to bring all of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.590 
it really allows you to bring all of
them<00:01:21.950> together<00:01:22.180> personally<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:23.210> don't<00:01:23.390> think

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
them together personally I don't think

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.719 
them together personally I don't think
all<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> pulp<00:01:24.200> genres<00:01:24.619> blend<00:01:25.010> all<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.340> well

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
all the pulp genres blend all that well

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.520 
all the pulp genres blend all that well
although<00:01:26.030> if<00:01:26.240> any<00:01:26.420> game<00:01:26.659> does<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.320> one

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
although if any game does it this one

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.950 
although if any game does it this one
does<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.040> best<00:01:28.070> what<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.180> supposes<00:01:29.810> is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
does it the best what it supposes is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.240 
does it the best what it supposes is
that<00:01:30.110> they're<00:01:30.260> sort<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.560> an<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.950> group

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
that they're sort of an a group
