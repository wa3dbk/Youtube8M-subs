00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.379 
update this without a second thought but
if<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> try<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.460> use<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.910> app<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.360> will

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
quickly reveal that this app works

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.700 
quickly reveal that this app works
totally<00:00:18.000> differently<00:00:18.600> than<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> S<00:00:19.199> note<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
totally differently than the S note that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
totally differently than the S note that
you're<00:00:19.890> used<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.000> video<00:00:21.210> I'll

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you're used to so in this video I'll

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.120 
you're used to so in this video I'll
explain<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.230> app<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.470> intended<00:00:23.100> for

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
explain what this app is intended for

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
explain what this app is intended for
why<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.119> addition<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.810> notes<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
why it is in addition to your notes to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800 
why it is in addition to your notes to
another<00:00:25.740> replacement<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.849> S<00:00:27.029> note<00:00:27.269> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
another replacement for your S note so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:37.030 
another replacement for your S note so
let's<00:00:28.080> check<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> out

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.010 

so<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.220> new<00:00:38.430> S<00:00:38.640> note<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.180> almost<00:00:39.630> an<00:00:39.900> identical

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
so the new S note is almost an identical

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.250 
so the new S note is almost an identical
copy<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.070> what's<00:00:41.280> present<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.120> note<00:00:42.300> 3<00:00:42.750> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
copy to what's present on the note 3 but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
copy to what's present on the note 3 but
to<00:00:43.440> clearly<00:00:43.860> understand<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> new<00:00:44.820> S<00:00:45.059> note

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to clearly understand how the new S note

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.150 
to clearly understand how the new S note
is<00:00:45.480> different<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.080> have<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.440> look<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.739> how<00:00:46.890> s

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is different you have to look at how s

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180 
is different you have to look at how s
note<00:00:47.460> evolved<00:00:47.970> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> note<00:00:48.390> 3<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.710> note<00:00:49.860> 3

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
note evolved on the note 3 on the note 3

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
note evolved on the note 3 on the note 3

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the functions of S note that existed on

the notes to branched off into two

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
the notes to branched off into two
separate<00:00:54.840> applications<00:00:55.500> action<00:00:56.190> memo<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.670> s

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
after you install the new s note you
will<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.070> made<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.550> handle<00:01:29.940> both

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
will see that it was made to handle both

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
will see that it was made to handle both
the<00:01:30.149> functions<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.960> creating<00:01:31.470> drawings<00:01:31.860> and
