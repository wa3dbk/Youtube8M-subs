00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.140 
Absolut Nouveau and then I started using
that<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:31.169> fell<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.530> love<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.829> it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
that one and I fell in love with it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.449 
that one and I fell in love with it
right<00:02:32.329> away<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.079> lugs<00:02:33.409> allowed<00:02:34.189> you

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
right away because the lugs allowed you

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.759 
right away because the lugs allowed you
to<00:02:34.640> change<00:02:34.939> heads<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:36.019> quickly<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.680> so

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
to change heads so quickly and so

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.160 
to change heads so quickly and so
efficiently<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.599> road<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.049> were

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
efficiently and on the road we were

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.020 
efficiently and on the road we were
changing<00:02:39.620> heads<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:39.920> lot<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.549> made<00:02:40.790> our

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
changing heads a lot so that made our

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.880 
changing heads a lot so that made our
life<00:02:41.209> way<00:02:41.840> way<00:02:42.140> easier<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:44.650> last<00:02:45.650> year

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
life way way easier and then last year

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.699 
life way way easier and then last year
actually<00:02:46.129> I<00:02:46.400> got<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:47.030> first<00:02:47.360> Yamaha<00:02:48.110> Phoenix

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
it was funny because we were rehearsing

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.890 
it was funny because we were rehearsing
for<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.459> long<00:02:58.700> tour<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.329> had<00:02:59.510> last<00:02:59.720> year

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900

with Pat Metheny

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.729 
with Pat Metheny
and<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:02.090> was<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.329> first<00:03:02.540> time<00:03:02.840> he<00:03:03.290> had<00:03:03.470> heard

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
and it was the first time he had heard

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.190 
and it was the first time he had heard
this<00:03:03.950> kid<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.940> remember<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:05.720> basically

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
this kid so I remember we basically

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.110 
this kid so I remember we basically
unwrapped<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.099> in<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> studio<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:07.819> put<00:03:08.030> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
unwrapped it in the studio we put it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.420 
unwrapped it in the studio we put it

a<00:03:10.459> couple<00:03:10.639> of<00:03:10.819> tunes<00:03:11.209> he<00:03:11.329> just<00:03:11.510> looked<00:03:11.720> at<00:03:11.840> me

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
a couple of tunes he just looked at me

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.869 
a couple of tunes he just looked at me
and<00:03:12.049> he<00:03:12.260> said<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.859> have<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.040> be<00:03:13.280> careful<00:03:13.730> with

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
and he said you have to be careful with

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.289 
and he said you have to be careful with
that<00:03:13.940> thing

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
that thing

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.839 
that thing

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
tours that I've done and it's just as

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.599 
tours that I've done and it's just as
consistent<00:03:53.449> as<00:03:53.599> any<00:03:54.169> other<00:03:54.500> Yamaha<00:03:55.250> kid<00:03:55.459> I've

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
ever played but this actually seems to

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.460 
ever played but this actually seems to
vibrate<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.519> little<00:03:58.849> bit<00:03:58.970> more<00:03:59.359> because<00:04:00.049> of<00:04:00.349> the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
vibrate a little bit more because of the
