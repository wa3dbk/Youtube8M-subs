want to talk to you today about

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.950 
want to talk to you today about
microsoft<00:00:05.700> surface<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.750> cool

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
microsoft surface and the cool

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.570 
microsoft surface and the cool
applications<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.680> build<00:00:08.010> using<00:00:08.280> this

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
applications you can build using this

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.839 
applications you can build using this
device<00:00:09.000> from<00:00:09.389> Microsoft<00:00:10.490> let's<00:00:11.490> look<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.759> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
device from Microsoft let's look at this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.020 
device from Microsoft let's look at this
device<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.920> we've<00:00:14.070> done<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.759> built

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
device what we've done here is we built

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.840 
device what we've done here is we built
an<00:00:15.210> interactive<00:00:15.870> meeting<00:00:16.619> visualizer<00:00:17.130> using

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
an interactive meeting visualizer using

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.439 
an interactive meeting visualizer using
bubbles<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.510> shapes<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.939> we<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> interact

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
bubbles as shapes that we can interact

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
bubbles as shapes that we can interact
with<00:00:21.660> using<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> touch<00:00:22.500> features<00:00:22.949> at<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
with using the touch features at the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.500 
with using the touch features at the
surface<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.960> each<00:00:25.170> bubble<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:26.510> responsible

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
surface now each bubble is responsible

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.259 
surface now each bubble is responsible
for<00:00:27.689> its<00:00:27.720> own<00:00:27.930> movement<00:00:28.699> visualization<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
for its own movement visualization and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.749 
for its own movement visualization and
data<00:00:30.539> binding<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.009> also<00:00:32.130> interact<00:00:32.460> with

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
data binding we can also interact with

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
data binding we can also interact with
these<00:00:32.880> bubbles<00:00:33.469> as<00:00:34.469> each<00:00:34.710> bubble<00:00:34.950> represents

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
these bubbles as each bubble represents

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
these bubbles as each bubble represents
a<00:00:35.730> meeting<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> details<00:00:37.380> for

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a meeting we can look at the details for

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.880 
a meeting we can look at the details for
that<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.890> need<00:00:37.920> who<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.700> participating<00:00:39.120> and

that we need who is participating and
some<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> metrics<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.820> meeting

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
some of the metrics of that meeting

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
some of the metrics of that meeting
let's<00:00:43.379> add<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.590> attendees<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.640> meeting

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.229 

alright<00:00:50.440> that's<00:00:50.770> good<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.160> got<00:00:51.520> for<00:00:51.850> attending

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
alright that's good I got for attending

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.210 
alright that's good I got for attending
people<00:00:52.570> into<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:52.840> meeting<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.559> can<00:00:53.980> see<00:00:54.070> that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
people into this meeting I can see that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.910 
people into this meeting I can see that
my<00:00:54.309> practice<00:00:54.520> day<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.059> fairly<00:00:55.360> high<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
my practice day is fairly high the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.190 
my practice day is fairly high the
carbon<00:00:57.370> dioxide<00:00:57.910> footprints<00:00:58.510> slope<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
carbon dioxide footprints slope in the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.990 
carbon dioxide footprints slope in the
cost<00:00:59.410> is<00:00:59.530> very<00:00:59.559> low<00:00:59.830> so<00:01:00.250> this<00:01:00.400> is<00:01:00.430> good<00:01:00.730> meeting

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
cost is very low so this is good meeting

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.030 
cost is very low so this is good meeting
I'm<00:01:01.210> happy<00:01:01.480> with<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:01.750> let's<00:01:02.650> look<00:01:02.710> at<00:01:02.950> this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
I'm happy with that let's look at this

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.609 
I'm happy with that let's look at this
one<00:01:03.100> which<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.670> much<00:01:04.089> bigger<00:01:04.390> meeting<00:01:04.809> which

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
one which is a much bigger meeting which

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.350 
one which is a much bigger meeting which
means<00:01:05.830> that<00:01:05.920> it's<00:01:06.160> not<00:01:06.430> as<00:01:06.640> productive<00:01:07.000> on

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
means that it's not as productive on

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.350 
means that it's not as productive on
probably<00:01:08.320> have<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.560> do<00:01:08.710> something<00:01:08.920> about<00:01:09.100> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
probably have to do something about that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.230 
probably have to do something about that
let's<00:01:10.360> change<00:01:10.660> that<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.590> video<00:01:11.890> conference

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
let's change that to a video conference

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280 
let's change that to a video conference
alright<00:01:13.240> looks<00:01:13.720> much<00:01:13.930> better<00:01:14.110> man<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.360> using

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
alright looks much better man so using

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.870 
alright looks much better man so using
all<00:01:17.530> these<00:01:17.740> touch<00:01:17.979> features<00:01:18.369> we<00:01:18.580> can<00:01:18.729> easily

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
all these touch features we can easily

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.590 
all these touch features we can easily
interact<00:01:19.270> with<00:01:19.720> all<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.020> data<00:01:20.229> on<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.039> on<00:01:21.399> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
interact with all the data on the on the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.160 
interact with all the data on the on the
surface<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.810> all<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.259> visualized<00:01:23.680> meetings

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
surface and all the visualized meetings

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.670 
surface and all the visualized meetings
it<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.320> an<00:01:26.440> internet<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.180> intuitive<00:01:28.440> way<00:01:29.440> of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
it is an internet in intuitive way of

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.529 
it is an internet in intuitive way of
interacting<00:01:30.160> with<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.670> data<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.479> the

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
interacting with the data and the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.050 
interacting with the data and the
information<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.680> we<00:01:32.830> can<00:01:32.979> see<00:01:33.130> here<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.490> can

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
information that we can see here I can

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.139 
information that we can see here I can
instantly<00:01:34.390> open<00:01:35.229> up<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.560> new<00:01:35.590> meeting<00:01:36.250> by<00:01:36.910> just

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
instantly open up a new meeting by just
