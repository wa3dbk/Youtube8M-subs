00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.240 
everybody out making sure they get this
right<00:03:00.840> would<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.470> what<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.860> see<00:03:02.069> what

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
right would you see what you see what

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
right would you see what you see what
you<00:03:02.310> see<00:03:02.670> well<00:03:02.939> they're<00:03:03.120> gonna<00:03:03.239> mark<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.689> at

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
you see well they're gonna mark it at

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
you see well they're gonna mark it at
the<00:03:03.930> 16<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> think<00:03:05.189> they're<00:03:05.370> ruling<00:03:05.700> is

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the 16 but I think they're ruling is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.369 
the 16 but I think they're ruling is
that<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.060> hit<00:03:06.209> branch<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.019> Carter

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
that it hit branch and not Carter

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.319 
that it hit branch and not Carter
because<00:03:08.280> they're<00:03:08.430> not<00:03:08.579> marking<00:03:08.970> at<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> one

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
because they're not marking at the one

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.729 
because they're not marking at the one
but<00:03:09.569> they're<00:03:09.689> also<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:09.959> bringing<00:03:10.409> out<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
but they're also not bringing out to the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.259 
but they're also not bringing out to the
20<00:03:11.129> which<00:03:11.340> would<00:03:11.519> indicate<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:12.030> didn't

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
20 which would indicate they didn't

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
20 which would indicate they didn't
think<00:03:12.450> branch<00:03:12.720> rescued<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.290> at<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> one

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
think branch rescued it at the one

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.190 
think branch rescued it at the one
they're<00:03:14.700> marking<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.120> at<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.329> 16<00:03:15.930> so

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
they're marking it at the 16 so

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.899 
they're marking it at the 16 so
apparently<00:03:16.680> they<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.400> no<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.760> hit

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
apparently they think it no it hit

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.369 
apparently they think it no it hit
Carter's<00:03:18.360> arm<00:03:18.629> first<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:20.700> was<00:03:20.879> clear<00:03:21.840> yep

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
Carter's arm first that was clear yep

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.170 
Carter's arm first that was clear yep
evidence<00:03:23.040> right<00:03:23.280> there

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
evidence right there

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.210

well things have a way of evening out
you<00:03:28.090> can<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.390> branch<00:03:28.720> turning<00:03:29.349> his<00:03:29.530> right

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920

see it until the replay after the
11-yard<00:04:29.050> completion<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.740> Barnidge<00:04:30.160> alan<00:04:30.900> goes

job usually they do it very well and as
I<00:04:38.290> said<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.500> think<00:04:38.560> particularly<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.250> this

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.700 
I said I think particularly in this
conference<00:04:39.940> but<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.140> turning<00:04:41.380> into<00:04:41.620> a

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
conference but this is turning into a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.010 
conference but this is turning into a
bit<00:04:41.890> of<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:42.070> fiasco<00:04:42.280> now<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:43.210> each<00:04:43.690> coach

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
bit of a fiasco now in each coach

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.530 
bit of a fiasco now in each coach
believes<00:04:44.410> he<00:04:44.680> has<00:04:44.710> been<00:04:45.010> badly<00:04:45.370> victimized<00:04:46.150> by
