in<00:00:44.390> wait<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.719> thought<00:00:46.200> Wheeljack<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> one

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
in wait I thought Wheeljack was the one

who<00:00:47.520> left<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> records

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
Jackie basically deserted once the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
Jackie basically deserted once the
record<00:00:51.629> fell<00:00:51.840> under<00:00:52.110> ultra<00:00:52.530> Magnus's<00:00:53.160> command

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
record fell under ultra Magnus's command

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
record fell under ultra Magnus's command
