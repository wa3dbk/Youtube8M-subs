00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that and it actually turned out to be a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
that and it actually turned out to be a
pretty<00:00:28.769> good<00:00:28.920> game<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.550> goes<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
pretty good game so it goes down to the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.519 
pretty good game so it goes down to the
last<00:00:30.300> round<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> tell<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.349> who

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
last round I'm not going to tell you who

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
last round I'm not going to tell you who
wins<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.309> also<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.059> game<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.510> 11

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
wins and then also the game is about 11

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.209 
wins and then also the game is about 11
minutes<00:00:34.079> long<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.469> i<00:00:34.710> think<00:00:34.770> i'm<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
minutes long so i think i'm going to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.860 
minutes long so i think i'm going to
break<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:35.910> videos<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.600> because

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
break it up into two videos just because

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
break it up into two videos just because
11<00:00:37.200> minutes<00:00:37.469> would<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> pretty<00:00:37.950> long<00:00:38.129> video

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
