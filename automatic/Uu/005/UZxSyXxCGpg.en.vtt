 bt 70 Afghan version while they 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.120
 painted in general that's what I got 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 until I paint it because 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 there is no airbrush yet 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.399
 put here so here on the model 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.399
