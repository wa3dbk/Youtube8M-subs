00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
actually pretty remarkable I mean it

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.680 
actually pretty remarkable I mean it
doesn't<00:01:46.940> use<00:01:47.420> sort<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.170> 3d<00:01:48.620> graphics<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.690> you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.770 
will have have kind of an area of
control<00:03:38.090> around<00:03:38.710> around<00:03:39.710> them<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.660> it's<00:03:41.660> a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
control around around them so it's a

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.100 
control around around them so it's a
situation<00:03:41.990> where<00:03:43.390> opposing<00:03:44.390> civilizations

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
situation where opposing civilizations

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.170 
situation where opposing civilizations
can't<00:03:45.350> come<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.180> conquer

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
can't come in and conquer

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.810 
can't come in and conquer
indiscriminately<00:03:48.140> or<00:03:48.410> settle<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.550> spin

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
indiscriminately or settle in to spin

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.160 
indiscriminately or settle in to spin
indiscriminately<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.600> there's<00:03:50.810> there's<00:03:51.080> a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
indiscriminately and there's there's a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.660 
indiscriminately and there's there's a
sense<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:53.270> know<00:03:53.770> kind<00:03:54.770> of<00:03:54.830> an<00:03:55.040> internal

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
sense of you know kind of an internal

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.450 
sense of you know kind of an internal
cohesion<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.510> also<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.470> really<00:03:58.070> comes<00:03:58.250> into

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
cohesion and also it really comes into

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.080 
cohesion and also it really comes into
play<00:03:58.670> where<00:04:00.160> another<00:04:01.160> civilization<00:04:01.700> comes<00:04:01.910> in

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
play where another civilization comes in

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.610 
play where another civilization comes in
and<00:04:02.210> conquered<00:04:02.510> city<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:03.320> won't

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
and conquered city it won't

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.410 
and conquered city it won't
automatically<00:04:04.310> be<00:04:04.520> there's<00:04:04.790> there's<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
automatically be there's there's the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.450 
automatically be there's there's the
chance<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.620> if<00:04:06.830> your

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
chance that you know if your

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.740 
chance that you know if your
civilization<00:04:08.090> has<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.720> high<00:04:09.110> culture<00:04:09.530> rating

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
civilization has a high culture rating

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.000 
civilization has a high culture rating
the<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.960> people<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.800> have<00:04:12.920> been

the the people that that have been

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.950 
the the people that that have been
conquered<00:04:13.460> might<00:04:13.670> revolt<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.660> know<00:04:14.750> come

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
conquered might revolt and you know come

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.680 
conquered might revolt and you know come
back<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.700> know<00:04:16.790> give<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> city<00:04:17.390> back<00:04:17.570> to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
back to you know give the city back to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.330 
back to you know give the city back to
your<00:04:18.019> civilization<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.130> now<00:04:19.220> that's

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
your civilization so and now that's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.979 
your civilization so and now that's
that's<00:04:19.609> kind<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.209> completely<00:04:20.660> new<00:04:20.810> concept

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
that's kind of a completely new concept

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.250

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
part of the game the combat system has

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.110 
part of the game the combat system has
been<00:04:51.050> completely<00:04:51.590> overhauled<00:04:51.919> in<00:04:52.850> in<00:04:53.090> a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
been completely overhauled in in a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.050 
been completely overhauled in in a
couple<00:04:53.360> key<00:04:53.480> ways<00:04:53.660> I<00:04:53.840> mean<00:04:53.990> in<00:04:55.060> several

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
couple key ways I mean in several

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.810 
couple key ways I mean in several
different<00:04:56.180> key<00:04:56.630> elements<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.280> civilization<00:04:58.280> 3

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
different key elements of civilization 3

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.540 
different key elements of civilization 3
is<00:04:59.030> reminiscent<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.630> Alpha<00:05:00.260> Centauri<00:05:00.520> there<00:05:01.520> I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
is reminiscent of Alpha Centauri there I

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.040 
is reminiscent of Alpha Centauri there I
mean<00:05:01.880> there<00:05:01.970> was<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.240> new<00:05:02.360> concept<00:05:02.930> of

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
mean there was the new concept of

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.590 
mean there was the new concept of
bombardment<00:05:03.890> with<00:05:04.190> units<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.790> just<00:05:05.360> kind<00:05:05.540> of

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
bombardment with units and just kind of

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.230 
bombardment with units and just kind of
a<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:06.680> know<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.800> different<00:05:07.340> different<00:05:07.880> feel<00:05:08.210> to

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
a you know a different different feel to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.300 
a you know a different different feel to
to<00:05:08.600> combat<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.560> was<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.830> know<00:05:09.950> much<00:05:10.130> more

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
to combat it it was you know much more

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.370 
to combat it it was you know much more
involved<00:05:10.760> so<00:05:11.330> that's<00:05:11.810> that's<00:05:11.990> been<00:05:12.169> brought

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
involved so that's that's been brought

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.170 
involved so that's that's been brought
into<00:05:12.530> Silla<00:05:12.800> dation<00:05:13.130> 3

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
into Silla dation 3

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.300 
into Silla dation 3
and<00:05:14.350> you<00:05:15.350> know<00:05:15.440> there<00:05:15.590> are<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.889> lot<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:16.160> new

from a more fully fleshed out part of

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.070 
from a more fully fleshed out part of
the<00:05:23.300> game<00:05:24.160> there<00:05:25.160> are<00:05:25.190> actually<00:05:26.120> now<00:05:26.300> special
