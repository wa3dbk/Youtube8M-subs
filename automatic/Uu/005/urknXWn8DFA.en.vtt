00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
gara plugins here with the first day of

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.880 
gara plugins here with the first day of
my<00:00:02.610> second<00:00:03.060> week<00:00:03.179> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.720> peaking<00:00:04.470> program

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
my second week on the peaking program

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.950 
my second week on the peaking program
this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> deadlift<00:00:06.089> day<00:00:06.299> where<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.540> woke<00:00:06.720> up

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
this is a deadlift day where I woke up

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.100 
this is a deadlift day where I woke up
to<00:00:07.170> two<00:00:07.500> heavy<00:00:07.710> sets<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.189> three<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.670> then<00:00:09.110> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
to two heavy sets of three and then to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.799 
to two heavy sets of three and then to
back<00:00:10.349> off<00:00:10.559> sets<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.070> three<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.429> well<00:00:11.639> top<00:00:12.480> set

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
back off sets of three as well top set

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
back off sets of three as well top set
should<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.230> around<00:00:13.469> 92<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.549> ninety-three

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
should be around 92 to ninety-three

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.689 
should be around 92 to ninety-three
percent<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.980> back<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.190> work<00:00:17.460> should<00:00:17.670> be

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
percent and the back off work should be

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.950 
percent and the back off work should be
ten<00:00:18.000> percent<00:00:18.359> under<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.340> tried<00:00:20.760> to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
ten percent under that so I tried to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.210 
ten percent under that so I tried to
just<00:00:21.960> add<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.439> weight<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> numbers

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
just add some weight for the numbers

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
just add some weight for the numbers
that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.490> had<00:00:23.609> done<00:00:23.760> previously<00:00:24.109> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> last

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that I had done previously in the last

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.910 
that I had done previously in the last
training<00:00:25.859> cycle<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> believe

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
training cycle and so here I believe

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.889 
training cycle and so here I believe
this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.310> first<00:00:29.580> set<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.640> 665

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
this is my first set and this is a 665

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
this is my first set and this is a 665
these<00:00:33.899> three<00:00:34.230> went<00:00:34.469> okay<00:00:34.890> definitely<00:00:35.550> better

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
these three went okay definitely better

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.069 
these three went okay definitely better
than<00:00:35.790> last<00:00:36.059> week<00:00:36.500> 635<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.860> felt<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.760> heavy

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
than last week 635 had felt really heavy

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
than last week 635 had felt really heavy
when<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> did<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> four<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:40.829> three<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.430> my

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
when I did the four by three and my

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
when I did the four by three and my
handheld<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.469> better<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
handheld was a little bit better on this

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
handheld was a little bit better on this
day<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> still<00:00:44.789> ended<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.149> tearing<00:00:45.390> callous

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
day but I still ended up tearing callous

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
day but I still ended up tearing callous
and<00:00:46.260> you'll<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.039> why<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> next<00:00:47.850> set<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and you'll see why on this next set I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.580 
and you'll see why on this next set I
jumped<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.829> six<00:00:50.520> ninety<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.149> had<00:00:51.870> done<00:00:52.050> 680

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
jumped up to six ninety i had done 680

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
jumped up to six ninety i had done 680
in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> previous<00:00:53.510> peaking<00:00:54.510> cycle<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
in the previous peaking cycle and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
in the previous peaking cycle and
thought<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> would<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.520> able<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
thought that I would be able to get this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.959 
thought that I would be able to get this
I've<00:00:57.840> done<00:00:58.199> almost<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.920> full<00:00:59.129> triple<00:00:59.579> with

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
I've done almost the full triple with

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.830 
I've done almost the full triple with
705<00:01:00.690> before<00:01:01.250> first<00:01:02.250> rep<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.670> okay<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.809> as

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
705 before first rep one okay as well as

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
705 before first rep one okay as well as
the<00:01:04.110> second<00:01:04.530> rep<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> third<00:01:05.610> rep

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the second rep but it's the third rep

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.390 
the second rep but it's the third rep
where<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.479> disappointed<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.320> this

sometimes you'll stall out for it walls

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
sometimes you'll stall out for it walls
I've<00:01:51.030> done<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> before<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.560> bench<00:01:52.770> press

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I've done that before on my bench press

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
I've done that before on my bench press
and<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.420> seems<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.750> my<00:01:54.899> deadlift<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and it seems like my deadlift is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
and it seems like my deadlift is
starting<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> slow<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.520> well<00:01:56.869> there<00:01:57.869> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
starting to slow down as well there are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
starting to slow down as well there are
some<00:01:58.049> reasons<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.740> probably<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
some reasons for that probably the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
some reasons for that probably the
amount<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> sumo<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.659> affects<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.770> hip

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
amount of sumo that I do affects my hip

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
amount of sumo that I do affects my hip
help<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> I've<00:02:02.880> also<00:02:03.060> focused<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.840> much<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
help and I've also focused so much on

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
help and I've also focused so much on
bench<00:02:04.619> lately<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> haven't<00:02:05.790> done<00:02:06.210> quite

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
bench lately that I haven't done quite

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.410 
bench lately that I haven't done quite
as<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:06.810> squatting<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:08.160> deadlift<00:02:08.849> work<00:02:09.149> even

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
as much squatting or deadlift work even

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
as much squatting or deadlift work even
I<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:09.690> say<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.170> hamstring<00:02:10.709> curls<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.190> some

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
I would say and hamstring curls and some

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.200 
I would say and hamstring curls and some
other<00:02:11.489> things<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
other things so

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.540 
other things so
I'm<00:02:12.930> probably<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> up<00:02:13.830> my<00:02:13.860> low

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I'm probably going to have to up my low

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.030 
I'm probably going to have to up my low
bar<00:02:14.760> squatting<00:02:15.440> probably<00:02:16.440> work<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.740> little<00:02:16.890> bit

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
bar squatting probably work a little bit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.670 
bar squatting probably work a little bit
more<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.460> some<00:02:17.880> posterior<00:02:18.630> chain<00:02:18.900> exercises

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
more on some posterior chain exercises

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.010 
more on some posterior chain exercises
maybe<00:02:19.950> some<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:20.370> conventional<00:02:20.940> polling<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
maybe some more conventional polling and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.950 
maybe some more conventional polling and
try<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> drive<00:02:22.710> my<00:02:22.920> sumo<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.690> get<00:02:24.840> up

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
try to drive my sumo up so I can get up

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.360 
try to drive my sumo up so I can get up
close<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.350> really<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.920> year<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> get

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
close I really want this year to get

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
close I really want this year to get
close<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.090> over<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> 800<00:02:28.200> pound<00:02:28.230> mark<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
close if not over the 800 pound mark and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.010 
close if not over the 800 pound mark and
I<00:02:29.490> think<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.850> possible<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:30.750> definitely

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
I think it's possible but I'm definitely

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.600 
I think it's possible but I'm definitely
going<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.710> unstuck<00:02:32.190> from<00:02:32.250> where

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.590 
going to have to get unstuck from where
I'm<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:32.910> which<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.450> somewhere<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.050> low<00:02:34.200> 70

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
I'm at which is somewhere in the low 70

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.700 
I'm at which is somewhere in the low 70
there<00:02:36.600> are<00:02:36.720> some<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:36.870> days<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.230> some<00:02:37.470> bad

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
there are some good days and some bad

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.680 
there are some good days and some bad
days<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.130> sumo<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.030> was<00:02:39.210> not<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:39.510> best

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
days with sumo but this was not my best

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.380 
days with sumo but this was not my best
day<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:39.960> sure<00:02:40.380> I'm<00:02:41.040> also<00:02:41.190> noticing<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:42.060> little

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
day for sure I'm also noticing a little

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300 
day for sure I'm also noticing a little
bit<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.570> unevenness<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.200> my<00:02:43.470> legs<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.280> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bit of unevenness in my legs and so I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.160 
bit of unevenness in my legs and so I
may<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.850> work<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.210> some<00:02:45.540> form

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
may have to work on some form

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.380 
may have to work on some form
adjustments<00:02:46.830> even<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.670> they're<00:02:47.820> just<00:02:47.850> slight
