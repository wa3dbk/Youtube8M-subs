00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.280 

I've<00:00:12.100> grown<00:00:12.639> two<00:00:13.030> different<00:00:13.540> plants<00:00:14.139> of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
I've grown two different plants of

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.980 
I've grown two different plants of
rhubarb<00:00:14.830> in<00:00:15.129> two<00:00:15.910> different<00:00:16.150> places<00:00:16.450> but

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
rhubarb in two different places but

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.420 
rhubarb in two different places but
they've<00:00:17.200> both<00:00:17.470> died<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:19.090> do<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.300> do<00:00:20.430> rhubarb

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
they've both died what do I do rhubarb

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.040 
they've both died what do I do rhubarb
does<00:00:21.700> better<00:00:21.940> in<00:00:22.060> more<00:00:22.300> northern<00:00:22.480> parts<00:00:22.990> of

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
does better in more northern parts of

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.290 
does better in more northern parts of
the<00:00:23.140> country<00:00:23.350> where<00:00:23.770> it's<00:00:24.190> colder<00:00:24.730> but<00:00:25.210> it

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
the country where it's colder but it

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.730 
the country where it's colder but it
will<00:00:25.480> grow<00:00:25.780> here<00:00:26.170> if<00:00:26.350> it's<00:00:26.500> given

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
will grow here if it's given

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.860 
will grow here if it's given
well-drained<00:00:27.250> sites<00:00:27.640> so<00:00:28.150> if<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.300> got<00:00:28.450> a<00:00:28.480> sandy

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 
well-drained sites so if you got a sandy

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.380 
well-drained sites so if you got a sandy
soil<00:00:29.080> or<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.350> raised<00:00:29.680> bed<00:00:29.860> with<00:00:30.730> enough<00:00:31.030> organic

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
soil or a raised bed with enough organic

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.060 
soil or a raised bed with enough organic
matter<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:31.930> it<00:00:32.050> doesn't<00:00:32.320> dry<00:00:32.410> out<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:32.890> can

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
matter so it doesn't dry out you can

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.310 
matter so it doesn't dry out you can
grow<00:00:33.250> rhubarb<00:00:33.670> here<00:00:33.969> but<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:34.989> important

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
grow rhubarb here but the important

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.389 
grow rhubarb here but the important
thing<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:35.559> don't<00:00:35.710> keep<00:00:35.920> it<00:00:36.040> too<00:00:36.219> wet

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
thing is don't keep it too wet

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.009 
thing is don't keep it too wet
especially<00:00:36.640> when<00:00:37.089> it's<00:00:37.239> dormant<00:00:37.570> or<00:00:37.749> it'll

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
especially when it's dormant or it'll

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.299 
especially when it's dormant or it'll
rot<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.440> that's<00:00:38.559> probably<00:00:38.829> what<00:00:38.949> happened<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
rot and that's probably what happened to

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.340 
rot and that's probably what happened to
yours<00:00:39.579> it's<00:00:40.239> in<00:00:40.329> a<00:00:40.359> clay<00:00:40.629> soil<00:00:40.960> it's<00:00:41.170> very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
yours it's in a clay soil it's very

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.410 
yours it's in a clay soil it's very
likely<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.710> ride<00:00:41.980> as<00:00:42.100> well<00:00:42.339> so<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.760> sandy

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
likely to ride as well so a sandy

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.000 
likely to ride as well so a sandy
well-drained<00:00:44.050> soil<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.499> your<00:00:44.620> best<00:00:44.769> bet<00:00:44.859> to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
well-drained soil is your best bet to

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
well-drained soil is your best bet to
make<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.370> grow

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

taught<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.059> before<00:00:52.300> with<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:53.230> plant<00:00:53.590> I've

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
taught you before with this plant I've

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.680 
taught you before with this plant I've
had<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:54.460> about<00:00:54.550> two<00:00:54.820> years<00:00:55.000> as<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.269> plan<00:00:55.540> for

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
had it for about two years as a plan for

my father lost funeral and so it does
have<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.910> sentimental<00:00:58.360> value<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.870> but

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.760 
you suggest okay what we've got here is
a<00:01:10.300> peace<00:01:10.540> lily<00:01:10.810> which<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.259> native<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.590> the

tropics to a very humid environment it

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.660 
tropics to a very humid environment it
doesn't<00:01:14.440> like<00:01:14.530> our<00:01:14.710> dry<00:01:14.950> air<00:01:15.159> very<00:01:15.460> much

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
doesn't like our dry air very much

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.249 
doesn't like our dry air very much
that's<00:01:16.000> part<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.390> problem<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:17.140> other

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
that's part of the problem the other

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.149 
that's part of the problem the other
part<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.619> problem<00:01:17.770> though<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.130> fact

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
part of the problem though is the fact

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.950 
part of the problem though is the fact
that<00:01:18.490> every<00:01:18.790> time<00:01:18.940> we<00:01:19.060> water<00:01:19.299> there's<00:01:19.570> salt<00:01:19.840> in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
that every time we water there's salt in

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.779 
that every time we water there's salt in
our<00:01:20.200> water<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.679> accumulates<00:01:21.250> in<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.490> soil

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
our water that accumulates in the soil

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.450 
our water that accumulates in the soil
in<00:01:22.000> time<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.750> plant<00:01:22.990> absorbs<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:24.009> causes

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
in time the plant absorbs it it causes

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.070 
in time the plant absorbs it it causes
this<00:01:24.580> leaf<00:01:24.820> burn<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.539> combination<00:01:25.720> of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
this leaf burn so the combination of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080 
this leaf burn so the combination of
salt<00:01:26.380> plus<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.860> dry<00:01:27.070> air<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.429> causing<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.910> leaf

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
salt plus the dry air is causing a leaf

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.029 
salt plus the dry air is causing a leaf
burn<00:01:28.330> what<00:01:28.929> we<00:01:29.050> need<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.259> do<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.619> plant<00:01:29.890> is

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
burn what we need to do this plant is

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.219 
burn what we need to do this plant is
repotted<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.820> well-drained<00:01:31.360> organic

can<00:01:44.229> before<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.649> repot<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.340> remove<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
can before you repot it so you remove a

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.669 
can before you repot it so you remove a
lot<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.000> these<00:01:46.060> salts<00:01:46.479> then<00:01:47.140> once<00:01:47.350> you've<00:01:47.470> done

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
lot of these salts then once you've done

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.410 
lot of these salts then once you've done
that<00:01:47.740> keep<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.250> moist<00:01:48.610> water<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.149> keep<00:01:49.300> it

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that keep it moist water it to keep it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.930 
that keep it moist water it to keep it
in<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.630> fairly<00:01:50.289> well<00:01:50.979> lit<00:01:51.250> location<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:51.850> it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
in a fairly well lit location but it

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.850 
in a fairly well lit location but it
tolerates<00:01:52.300> good<00:01:52.539> shade<00:01:52.810> but<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.410> important

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
tolerates good shade but the important

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.380 
tolerates good shade but the important
thing<00:01:53.890> now<00:01:54.069> we<00:01:54.340> need<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.849> be<00:01:55.000> sure<00:01:55.030> we

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
thing now we need to do is be sure we

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.180 
thing now we need to do is be sure we
don't<00:01:55.539> let<00:01:55.780> water<00:01:55.959> soak<00:01:56.319> back<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.920> can<00:01:57.009> see

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
don't let water soak back up we can see

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.040 
don't let water soak back up we can see
from<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.550> salt<00:01:57.819> stains<00:01:58.090> here<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.869> has<00:01:58.959> been

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
from the salt stains here this has been

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.240 
from the salt stains here this has been
sitting<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.440> water<00:01:59.590> when<00:01:59.800> you<00:01:59.830> water<00:02:00.069> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
sitting in water when you water the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.249 
sitting in water when you water the
water<00:02:00.429> accumulated<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:01.239> it<00:02:01.330> drew<00:02:01.630> back<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:02.110> so

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
water accumulated and it drew back up so

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.199 
water accumulated and it drew back up so
it<00:02:02.349> really<00:02:02.530> did<00:02:02.739> accumulate<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.550> salt<00:02:03.759> okay

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
it really did accumulate the salt okay

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.359 
it really did accumulate the salt okay
this<00:02:04.810> time<00:02:05.110> when<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.379> repot<00:02:05.709> it<00:02:05.739> set<00:02:06.069> it<00:02:06.190> so

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
this time when you repot it set it so

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.619 
this time when you repot it set it so
that<00:02:06.399> when<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.700> water<00:02:06.910> comes<00:02:07.179> out<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.569> the

organic material to the soil I apply

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.839 
organic material to the soil I apply
compost<00:02:59.470> every<00:02:59.799> year<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> fall<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.549> in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
think that's the secret is the organic

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.759 
think that's the secret is the organic
material<00:03:09.819> that's<00:03:09.970> in<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:11.139> did<00:03:11.409> I<00:03:11.439> apply

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
material that's in now that did I apply

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.440 
material that's in now that did I apply
to<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.040> garden<00:03:12.370> what's<00:03:12.849> nice<00:03:13.030> about<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.299> is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
to the garden what's nice about that is

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.179 
to the garden what's nice about that is
compost<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.170> made<00:03:14.349> from<00:03:14.620> something<00:03:14.980> we<00:03:15.069> would

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
compost is made from something we would

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.860 
compost is made from something we would
normally<00:03:15.340> landfill<00:03:16.030> throw<00:03:16.299> away<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.569> we're

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
normally landfill throw away so we're

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.330 
normally landfill throw away so we're
actually<00:03:17.019> being<00:03:17.319> very<00:03:17.500> environmental<00:03:18.159> by

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually being very environmental by

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.910 
actually being very environmental by
using<00:03:18.900> compost<00:03:19.900> which<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.319> made<00:03:20.500> from<00:03:20.709> waste

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
using compost which is made from waste

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
they were okay well this is Boston fern

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.170 
they were okay well this is Boston fern
Boston<00:03:53.970> fern<00:03:54.270> produces<00:03:54.990> runners<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.150> like<00:03:57.150> a

Boston fern produces runners and like a
potato<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.260> will<00:03:58.380> sometimes<00:03:58.740> swell<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.280> as<00:03:59.490> a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
potato it will sometimes swell up as a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.460 
potato it will sometimes swell up as a
storage<00:03:59.910> organ<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.780> got<00:04:00.960> tubers

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
storage organ and so you got tubers

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.170 
storage organ and so you got tubers
which<00:04:02.100> are<00:04:02.250> part<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.580> fern<00:04:02.700> storage

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
which are part of the fern storage

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.270 
which are part of the fern storage
organs<00:04:03.510> part<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.959> plant<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.860> nothing<00:04:05.190> to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
organs part of the plant it's nothing to

coloration<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.760> bark<00:05:07.000> shows<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.480> was

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
coloration of the bark shows it was

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.690 
coloration of the bark shows it was
underground<00:05:07.960> way<00:05:08.230> up<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.800> when<00:05:09.580> this

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
underground way up here and when this

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.550 
underground way up here and when this
tree<00:05:09.970> was<00:05:10.150> planted<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.780> really<00:05:11.020> had<00:05:11.170> no<00:05:11.320> chance

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
tree was planted it really had no chance

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.000 
tree was planted it really had no chance
of<00:05:11.800> surviving<00:05:12.750> had<00:05:13.750> had<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> person<00:05:14.530> inspected

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
of surviving had had a person inspected

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.470 
of surviving had had a person inspected
this<00:05:15.100> tree<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.520> pot<00:05:15.730> before<00:05:16.030> they<00:05:16.150> planted

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
this tree in the pot before they planted

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.210 
this tree in the pot before they planted
it<00:05:16.570> maybe<00:05:17.140> perhaps<00:05:17.440> they<00:05:17.800> could<00:05:17.860> have<00:05:18.040> gone<00:05:18.160> to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
it maybe perhaps they could have gone to

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.280 
it maybe perhaps they could have gone to
another<00:05:18.490> tree<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.030> got<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.900> better<00:05:20.110> quality

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
another tree and got a better quality

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.440 
another tree and got a better quality
tree<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.890> plant<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.640> this<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.090> one<00:05:22.300> of<00:05:22.390> the

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
tree to plant so this is one of the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.750 
tree to plant so this is one of the
reasons<00:05:22.780> why<00:05:22.930> we<00:05:23.110> fail<00:05:23.340> circling<00:05:24.340> roots<00:05:24.550> are<00:05:24.730> a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
reasons why we fail circling roots are a

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.980 
reasons why we fail circling roots are a
major<00:05:24.970> problem<00:05:25.360> what<00:05:25.450> would<00:05:25.510> someone<00:05:25.750> do<00:05:25.900> if

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
major problem what would someone do if

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
major problem what would someone do if
they<00:05:26.110> bought<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.350> tree<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:26.650> they<00:05:26.740> knew<00:05:26.890> they

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
they bought a tree and they knew they

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.350 
they bought a tree and they knew they
had<00:05:27.190> some<00:05:27.340> circling<00:05:27.730> roots<00:05:27.910> when<00:05:28.120> they<00:05:28.210> bought

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
had some circling roots when they bought

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.540 
had some circling roots when they bought
it<00:05:28.390> if<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.110> problem<00:05:29.350> isn't<00:05:29.620> too<00:05:29.800> extreme<00:05:30.310> they

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
it if the problem isn't too extreme they

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.400 
it if the problem isn't too extreme they
can<00:05:30.730> take<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.940> knife<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.630> score<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.200> routes

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
can take a knife and score the routes

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.860 
can take a knife and score the routes
along<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.340> side<00:05:33.580> inside<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.270> pot<00:05:34.480> there<00:05:34.720> on

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
along the side inside the pot there on

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.180 
along the side inside the pot there on
the<00:05:34.960> surface<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.470> root<00:05:35.620> ball<00:05:35.770> just<00:05:36.040> cut

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
the surface of the root ball just cut

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.230 
the surface of the root ball just cut
through<00:05:36.310> there<00:05:36.490> involved<00:05:36.850> cutting<00:05:37.030> those

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
through there involved cutting those

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.570 
through there involved cutting those
circling<00:05:37.690> roots<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.170> then<00:05:38.620> planted<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:39.220> also

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
circling roots and then planted and also

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.240 
circling roots and then planted and also
we<00:05:40.120> try<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.420> avoid<00:05:40.750> planting<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.500> tree<00:05:41.800> in<00:05:42.070> a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
we try to avoid planting a tree in a

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.310 
we try to avoid planting a tree in a
site<00:05:42.670> that<00:05:42.940> is<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.660> exact<00:05:44.050> same

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
site that is the exact same

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.350 
site that is the exact same
configuration<00:05:44.800> as<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.340> pot<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.820> we

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
configuration as the pot and we

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.120 
configuration as the pot and we
shouldn't<00:05:46.750> be<00:05:46.810> adding<00:05:47.170> a<00:05:47.230> lot<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.470> amendments

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
shouldn't be adding a lot of amendments

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.530 
shouldn't be adding a lot of amendments
because<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.610> we<00:05:48.730> may<00:05:48.910> trick<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.270> tree<00:05:49.420> and

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
because that we may trick the tree and

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.320 
because that we may trick the tree and
to<00:05:49.660> think<00:05:49.780> it's<00:05:50.230> another<00:05:50.470> pot<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.820> plant

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
to think it's another pot and so plant

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.660 
to think it's another pot and so plant
your<00:05:52.450> tree<00:05:52.660> in<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.870> larger<00:05:53.260> area<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.800> make<00:05:54.640> sure

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
your tree in a larger area and make sure

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.640 
your tree in a larger area and make sure
you<00:05:54.910> have<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.060> quality<00:05:55.480> tree<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.200> I<00:05:56.290> notice

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
you have a quality tree and I notice

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.560 
you have a quality tree and I notice
right<00:05:56.800> here<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:57.430> this<00:05:57.669> route<00:05:57.940> was<00:05:58.270> gurgling

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
right here that this route was gurgling

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.330 
right here that this route was gurgling
or<00:05:58.900> choking<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.560> trunk<00:05:59.830> of<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.040> tree<00:06:00.070> right

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
or choking the trunk of the tree right

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.170 
or choking the trunk of the tree right
there<00:06:00.550> you<00:06:00.610> can<00:06:00.700> see<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:00.820> tree<00:06:01.120> is

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
there you can see the tree is

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.390 
there you can see the tree is
constricted<00:06:01.780> where<00:06:02.530> that<00:06:02.680> route<00:06:02.860> was<00:06:03.010> against

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
constricted where that route was against

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.370 
constricted where that route was against
it<00:06:03.550> this<00:06:04.270> tree<00:06:04.480> tried<00:06:04.750> but<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.050> didn't<00:06:05.260> have<00:06:05.350> a

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
it this tree tried but it didn't have a

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.190 
it this tree tried but it didn't have a
chance<00:06:06.150> waste<00:06:07.150> of<00:06:07.330> money<00:06:07.450> to<00:06:07.690> waste<00:06:07.810> money

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
chance waste of money to waste money

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.260 
chance waste of money to waste money
like<00:06:08.260> this<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:09.340> it's<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.580> waste<00:06:09.790> that<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.060> sad

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
like this and it's a waste that the sad

thing<00:06:10.450> we<00:06:10.570> expect<00:06:10.900> this<00:06:11.020> tree<00:06:11.260> to<00:06:11.350> produce<00:06:11.530> and
