 device with such a neat 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.750
 ecologically safe i would say 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.060
 even the gift box is colorful 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.640
 polygraph printer vorito that using 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 This device can serve as mp3 files 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 your favorite radio stations

 have isat carriers small but honestly 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.150
 earned money discovering 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.530
 we are greeted by a warranty card 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.900
 which gives some kind of security right 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.390
 instruction in Russian and Ukrainian languages 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.660
 headphones that are required 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.960
 lawyers and cable and small ones will be useful 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.660
 similar hikes network adapter 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.480
 Well, finally, such a decent quality 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.880
 almost laid in a case 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.480
 removing the device itself 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.510
 smart tarazu 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.180
 the first feeling you know are nice on 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.860
 touch 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.660
 the effect of such a rubber is created 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.310
 Enclosures are ergonomic because comfortable 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.100
 placed in Russia there are no sharp 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.010
 about two hundred grams 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.340
 descendants power itself its functions let's 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.660
 closer to 40 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.720
 top of the device suddenly 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.710
 detects a lock on 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.090
 keyboard 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.200
 for steady power hold 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.290
 this button is at the leftmost position in 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.900
 for three seconds and everything will work out if 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.840
 translate to the right is happening 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.160
 keypad lock which 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.920
 is available 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.120
 any modes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.240
 Italians with a flick of your hand and run 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.790
 starting sequence and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.290
 in 7 seconds we get 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.780
 inside this device is 600 megahertz 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.820
 processor and operating system 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 based on linux which runs which 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.250
 It takes 7-8 seconds like a computer 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.720
 as you can see the display device based 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.400
 electronic ink technology 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.460
 open to her king and it means that she 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.979
 image is formed in 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.460
 reflected light and therefore 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.189
 power usage 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.919
 eye strain while reading 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.869
 minimum years screen size 6 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.239
 inches ours is 152 millimeters and 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.809
 800 by 600 pixels which 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.119
 lets even consider 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.150
 very clear photos then we have 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.959
 bottoms at the bottom of the device is 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:24.870
 connector for 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.650
 microtext headphones two and a half meters 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 so ordinary headphones do not fit 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.989
 but the scientific kia is available sound 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.669
 quite tolerable yet that slot for 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.720
 connect usd memory cards up to 32 gigabytes 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.919
 although there are already four inside 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.609
 gigabyte 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.459
 a place to 36 is a lot of books and more 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.989
 mini connector and taken away through which the device 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.169
 exchange data with the computer and your 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.080
 little books turning 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170
 wonderful thirty six gigabyte 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.089
 flash drive 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.919
 and through this connector is charging 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.499
 built-in lithium polymer 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.349
 batteries by the way and manufacturers 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.999
 promise reading mode continuous time 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.979
 works 9 thousand pages but the trainer 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.789
 will show at least with a full charge 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.889
 two weeks working and while there is not against 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.959
 there is still a light button to reset 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.810
 settings settings 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.040
 now turn to the front panel 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.569
 intuitively logical ergonomics 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.220
 control with five buttons 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.780
 does not give the right to get lost the most 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780
 main five-way button 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.980
 top down left navigation buttons 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.309
 right and center selection 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.889
 and it's not all in read mode here it is 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.449
 buttons switches size 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.239
 font small medium large and more 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.929
 turns the receiver on and off 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.909
 appropriate mode do not forget 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.079
 here is the important button to return to the original 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.449
 position if you hold it two 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.569
 seconds but then we fall immediately into 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.259
 main menu but still need to window tank 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.209
 one day transition to management 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.839
 playback devices 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.009
 recall pace 3 player and receiver 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.899
 mounted aboard the boat while reading 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.599
 very convenient quickly darted to switch 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.479
 music back to reading 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.799
 but also the last control 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.139
 button that rotates 90 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.599
 degrees text files to make it more convenient 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.819
 was read 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.729
 now let's take a look at 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.589
 main him which when reveals all 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.209
 opportunities given
