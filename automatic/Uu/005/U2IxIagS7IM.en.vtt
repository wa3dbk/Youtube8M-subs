go back and forth I think both have a
voice<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:51.120> very<00:00:51.600> different<00:00:52.079> voice<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> very

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
voice a very different voice but a very

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
voice a very different voice but a very
good<00:00:53.250> voice<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.300> quite<00:00:54.510> frankly<00:00:54.539> it's

good voice you know quite frankly it's
like<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.280> tubes<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:57.270> vintagey<00:00:57.809> thing

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
right
I<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> fence<00:01:00.329> though<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.079> they're

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I like the fence though because they're

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.570 
I like the fence though because they're
clear<00:01:01.739> they're<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:03.239> kind<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:04.070> let<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.280> change

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
clear they're they kind of let me change

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
clear they're they kind of let me change
drums<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.450> let<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.689> change<00:01:06.900> symbols<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> let

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
drums and let me change symbols and let

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
drums and let me change symbols and let
me<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.520> different<00:01:08.939> setups<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.630> they

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
me do different setups and they

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140 
me do different setups and they
represent<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.150> they're

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
represent kind of what it is they're

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
represent kind of what it is they're
very<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> aggressive<00:01:13.380> nature<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
very I like the aggressive nature of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.390 
very I like the aggressive nature of
them<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> find<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.299> they're<00:01:15.479> kind<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
them right I find that they're kind of

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.920 
them right I find that they're kind of
they<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> drum<00:01:17.939> kit<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.330> speak<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
they make the drum kit really speak and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.580 
they make the drum kit really speak and
sound<00:01:19.530> exciting<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.390> they're<00:01:21.390> big<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.439> other

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
sound exciting and they're big the other

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
sound exciting and they're big the other
thing<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> two<00:01:23.759> ones<00:01:24.000> that's<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
thing about about the two ones that's I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
thing about about the two ones that's I
like<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:24.990> nice<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.170> wide<00:01:25.560> they

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
like is that they're nice and wide they

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
like is that they're nice and wide they
can<00:01:26.400> tend<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> room<00:01:27.030> sound<00:01:27.299> bigger<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can tend to make a room sound bigger in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.399 
can tend to make a room sound bigger in
my<00:01:28.829> experience<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> I've<00:01:30.780> been<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> two

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
my experience so I've been using the two

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
my experience so I've been using the two
one<00:01:31.619> fits<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.430> overheads<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.600> don't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
one fits a lot on overheads for I don't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.830 
one fits a lot on overheads for I don't
know<00:01:34.079> maybe<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> good<00:01:34.829> year<00:01:35.070> now<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
know maybe about a good year now but if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210 
know maybe about a good year now but if
I'm<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.650> deliberately

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I'm going for something deliberately

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.429 
I'm going for something deliberately
more<00:01:38.490> indie<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.030> vintage<00:01:39.240> II<00:01:39.540> I'll<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.350> the

nice drum sound in the overheads that in

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.650 
nice drum sound in the overheads that in
my<00:04:37.889> mind<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> good<00:04:38.639> thing<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.120> if<00:04:39.300> people

want to get rid of that then that's

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.740 
want to get rid of that then that's

their option to roll it up and get rid
of<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.020> drums<00:04:43.229> right<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.919> can<00:04:44.070> always

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
of the drums right you can always

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.879 
of the drums right you can always
high-pass<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.120> right<00:04:45.630> thin<00:04:45.960> amount<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:46.770> I'd

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
high-pass and right thin amount but I'd

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.740 
high-pass and right thin amount but I'd
rather<00:04:47.070> start<00:04:47.669> with<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.910> nice<00:04:48.120> thick<00:04:48.180> drum

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
rather start with a nice thick drum

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.450 
rather start with a nice thick drum
sound<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.169> overheads<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.010> hopefully

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
sound on the overheads and hopefully

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.610 
sound on the overheads and hopefully
something<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.510> when<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.750> solo<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.320> go<00:04:52.440> wow

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
yeah we're pretty close to be and that's

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.890 
yeah we're pretty close to be and that's
my<00:04:56.490> goal<00:04:56.700> at<00:04:56.910> least<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.180> have<00:04:57.270> overheads<00:04:57.690> so

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
my goal at least to have overheads so

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.659 
my goal at least to have overheads so
that's<00:04:58.080> how<00:04:58.229> you<00:04:58.290> start<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:58.979> with<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.280> stereo

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
that's how you start is with the stereo

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.430 
that's how you start is with the stereo
pair<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.240> get<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.419> nice<00:05:00.720> image<00:05:01.050> then

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
pair you get a nice image then

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.040 
pair you get a nice image then
everything<00:05:01.889> needs<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.310> fit<00:05:02.460> in<00:05:02.580> with<00:05:02.729> that

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
everything needs to fit in with that

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.350 
everything needs to fit in with that
yeah<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.440> feel<00:05:05.039> like<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.520> checked<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.940> face<00:05:06.120> it

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
yeah I feel like it's checked to face it

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.550 
yeah I feel like it's checked to face it
do<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.630> check<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.960> face<00:05:07.139> against<00:05:07.500> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
do you check the face against the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.230 
do you check the face against the
overheads<00:05:08.039> or<00:05:08.190> do<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.370> start<00:05:08.610> with<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.820> kick

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
overheads or do you start with the kick

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.620 
overheads or do you start with the kick
drum<00:05:09.270> or<00:05:09.630> snare<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.350> would<00:05:10.889> where<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.310> start

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
drum or snare I would where do you start

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.150 
drum or snare I would where do you start
well<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.660> would<00:05:13.020> start<00:05:13.289> with<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.650> overheads

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
well I would start with the overheads

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.420 
well I would start with the overheads
and<00:05:14.460> getting<00:05:14.729> them<00:05:14.850> right<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.300> in<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.430> get

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and getting them right and in the get

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.650 
and getting them right and in the get
the<00:05:17.550> imaging<00:05:17.880> right<00:05:18.000> with<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.270> snare<00:05:18.510> and

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
the imaging right with the snare and

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.940 
the imaging right with the snare and
make<00:05:18.780> sure<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.169> snares<00:05:19.410> in<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.680> middle

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
make sure that the snares in the middle

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.550 
make sure that the snares in the middle
right<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.750> then<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.780> would<00:05:22.110> make<00:05:22.320> sure<00:05:22.530> that

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
right and then I would make sure that

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.129 
right and then I would make sure that
they<00:05:22.950> sound<00:05:23.220> right<00:05:24.000> with<00:05:24.270> your<00:05:24.450> crash<00:05:24.690> cymbals

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
they sound right with your crash cymbals

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.950 
they sound right with your crash cymbals
like<00:05:25.350> so<00:05:26.340> one<00:05:26.580> crash<00:05:26.820> cymbals<00:05:27.150> not<00:05:27.270> dominating

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
like so one crash cymbals not dominating

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.870 
like so one crash cymbals not dominating
and<00:05:28.169> one<00:05:28.320> doesn't<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.860> know<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.250> then<00:05:29.850> I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
make sure the floor toms not getting

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.100 
make sure the floor toms not getting
lost<00:05:56.400> that's<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.419> really<00:05:57.660> easy<00:05:57.780> thing<00:05:57.870> to

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
lost that's a really easy thing to

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.629 
lost that's a really easy thing to
happen<00:05:58.289> it's<00:05:58.590> like<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.860> rack<00:05:59.070> sounds<00:05:59.460> great

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
happen it's like the rack sounds great

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.400 
happen it's like the rack sounds great
snare<00:06:00.060> sounds<00:06:00.300> great<00:06:00.450> great<00:06:00.720> now<00:06:01.169> what<00:06:01.320> about

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
snare sounds great great now what about

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.080 
snare sounds great great now what about
the<00:06:01.560> floor<00:06:01.770> tom<00:06:01.979> it<00:06:02.220> sound<00:06:02.639> like<00:06:02.700> it's<00:06:02.849> in<00:06:02.940> the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
the floor tom it sound like it's in the

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.210 
the floor tom it sound like it's in the
next<00:06:03.330> door<00:06:03.510> right<00:06:04.139> so<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.349> try<00:06:04.710> to<00:06:04.770> get<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:04.979> Tom

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
next door right so I try to get the Tom

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.529 
next door right so I try to get the Tom
sounded<00:06:05.700> nice<00:06:05.789> and<00:06:06.000> balanced<00:06:06.330> in<00:06:06.450> the

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
sounded nice and balanced in the

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.200 
sounded nice and balanced in the
overheads<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:06.960> then<00:06:07.050> one

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
overheads and then one

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.580 
overheads and then one
that<00:06:07.330> happens<00:06:07.720> I<00:06:07.840> think<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.080> next<00:06:08.289> step<00:06:08.350> is

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
that happens I think the next step is

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.080 
that happens I think the next step is
bring<00:06:08.830> into<00:06:09.039> snare<00:06:09.310> and<00:06:09.490> work<00:06:09.610> with<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:09.880> phase

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
bring into snare and work with the phase

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.689 
bring into snare and work with the phase
on<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.360> snare<00:06:10.740> figure<00:06:11.740> out<00:06:11.919> where<00:06:12.220> it<00:06:12.370> lies

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
on the snare figure out where it lies

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.520 
on the snare figure out where it lies
phase<00:06:13.090> wise<00:06:13.360> do<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.720> need<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:14.050> reverse<00:06:14.500> the

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
phase wise do you need to reverse the

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.610 
phase wise do you need to reverse the
phase<00:06:14.889> do<00:06:15.639> you<00:06:15.759> need<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.030> move<00:06:16.180> mics<00:06:16.479> right<00:06:17.080> and

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
phase do you need to move mics right and

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.939 
phase do you need to move mics right and
then<00:06:18.220> once<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:18.550> have<00:06:18.669> overheads<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.240> snare

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
then once you have overheads and snare

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.839 
then once you have overheads and snare
usually<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.039> kick<00:06:21.220> will<00:06:21.340> follow<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.669> suit

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
usually the kick will follow the suit

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.010 
usually the kick will follow the suit
because<00:06:22.180> you're<00:06:22.330> going<00:06:22.419> to<00:06:22.479> be<00:06:22.599> rolling<00:06:22.930> up

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
because you're going to be rolling up

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.779 
because you're going to be rolling up
some<00:06:23.229> low-end<00:06:23.380> anyway<00:06:23.949> right<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.610> then<00:06:24.699> I'll

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
some low-end anyway right and then I'll

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.480 
some low-end anyway right and then I'll
work<00:06:24.940> with<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.240> kick<00:06:25.419> drum<00:06:25.630> in<00:06:25.780> itself

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
work with the kick drum in itself

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.620 
work with the kick drum in itself
there's<00:06:27.490> three<00:06:27.759> mics<00:06:28.000> there<00:06:28.210> we<00:06:28.360> want<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:28.539> make

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
there's three mics there we want to make

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.200 
there's three mics there we want to make
sure<00:06:28.660> their<00:06:28.930> face<00:06:29.139> coherent<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:29.889> then<00:06:30.849> once<00:06:31.090> I

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
sure their face coherent and then once I

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.430 
sure their face coherent and then once I
have<00:06:31.389> the<00:06:31.539> kick<00:06:31.720> snare<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.020> overheads

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
have the kick snare and overheads

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.100 
have the kick snare and overheads
happening<00:06:32.970> then<00:06:33.970> I<00:06:34.300> would<00:06:34.599> work<00:06:34.750> probably

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
happening then I would work probably

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.420 
happening then I would work probably
with<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.319> room<00:06:35.500> mics<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:35.889> make<00:06:36.039> sure<00:06:36.250> that

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430
