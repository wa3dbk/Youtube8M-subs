00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 which is why it is not that in this video is the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.890
 smoke our first episode of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.450
 series of bis sound curiosities or 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.870
 then it will work as follows 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.509
 will have two two curiosities in the video 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
 and maybe a curiosity balls that I 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 I'll randomly post a video 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.670
 for the other then we go to our 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.670
 first curiosity 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 Did you know that tokyo machine does 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 reference to three future maps that are 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.270
 following the ascension of coffee and mon 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 ted they show this reference 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.290
 through ropes that you can 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 find through the game and does 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.870
 reference to outside ag of harassment 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 same these letters there and also makes 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.129
 easter egg show reference one 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.129
 girl floating after a pyramid 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.780
 did you know that the xangri map there 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.680
 passes on mars 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.180
 because it is mars and this seems strange but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.210
 some people have proved this by 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.800
 kind of photos, you can tell 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.500
 It's in the love of the screen that you 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.570
 you can see three background moons being 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.580
 that our planet earth has only one 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.610
 besides some parts of the game you 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.890
 able to look around the world for about 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.600
 less so and you can see some 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.750
 mountains that have a certain similarity 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.410
 with the mars mountains then through 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.810
 It has also been concluded that the map 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.300
 xangri goes there on Mars in addition to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.880
 map developers say there are 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.400
 a secret no one discovered about 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.550
 there you are referring to your 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.550
 location 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.170
 Did you know that the Tokyo map 500 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.080
 has a hidden radius that stays in the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.149
 where energy buff takes you away 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.210
 there with more anger a voice is activated 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.150
 and this radio is a different 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.140
 I understand the version and then 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.140
 the radio voice 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.189
 so this was our first episode 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.989
 from the NGO curiosity series 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.420
 well I hope you have 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.849
 liked and also wanted to ask for your 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.519
 evaluation and feedback that you 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.260
 found on the video put in the comment the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.599
 what is bad what needs improvement 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.280
 How is business or what is it ? 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.590
 I'll stay around if you like 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.409
