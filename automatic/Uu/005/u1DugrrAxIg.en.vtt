00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
ELMO: Elmo's potty!

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.680
LOUIE: That's right, son.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.730
This potty is just for you.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.130
Now let's see, where do
you want to put it?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.830
Let's figure out where we're
going to put your potty.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.150
OK.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.780
ELMO: There, there,
there, Daddy.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.220
LOUIE: Right here?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.650
OK.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.250
Now, let Daddy just turn
it a little bit.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.240
You've got to just
turn it around.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.390
Now that's a good choice, son.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.430
ELMO: Elmo's potty.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.338
LOUIE: That's right,
it's Elmo's potty.

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:25.630
(SINGING) Now son, you're
getting bigger.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.480
Oh yes, it's really true.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.120
ELMO: True.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.340
LOUIE: (SINGING) And soon you
will be ready to do something

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.850
kind of new.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.620
So here is your new potty.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.400
When you have to pee or poo--

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.820
ELMO: Poo.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.570
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's
where you sit to do

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.090
what you gotta do-do.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.960
Because it's potty time,
gotta get down low.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.610
It's potty time,
just let it go.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.090
ELMO: Go.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.130
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's potty
time, yeah, go with the flow.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.590
It's potty time, you
can do it, I know.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.590
Now, you might like your diaper,
because it's what

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.400
you've always had.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.000
ELMO: Uh huh.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.070
LOUIE: But using your new potty
can make you really,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.310
really glad.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.010
Yes, it may take some time.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.520
But down the line, I can tell
that you'll do that cool poo

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.240
that you do so well.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.668
(SINGING) It's potty time,
gotta get down low.

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:17.340
ELMO: Low!

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.900
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's potty
time, just let it go.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.650
ELMO: Go!

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.546
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's potty
time, yeah, go with the flow.

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:28.965
It's potty time, you
can do it, I know.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:32.110
(SPEAKING) Well, all right.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.890
Here you go, boy.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.280
Let me help you out of the way
there, your heiny kinda small.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.350
(SINGING) Oh that's it, son.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.540
You're doing fine.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.280
You put your body on the potty
'cause it's potty time.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.525
Potty time, gotta
get down low.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.523
ELMO: Yeah!

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:53.016
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's potty
time, just let it go.

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.863
It's potty time, yeah,
go with the flow.

00:01:56.863 --> 00:01:57.550
ELMO: Flow!

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.732
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's potty,
potty time, you

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:00.910
can do it, I know.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.394
ELMO: Yeah!

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:02.846
LOUIE: (SINGING) It's
potty time.

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:05.266
It's potty time.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.674
It's potty time.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.259
You can do it, Elmo!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.160
Ooh, that's good, son.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.480
ELMO: Daddy?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.050
LOUIE: Now, where'd your mother
put the air freshener?
