showing the basics first thing we want
to<00:00:37.399> do<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.880> fall<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.690> vegetables<00:00:39.230> out<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:39.710> is

to do is fall the vegetables out this is
an<00:00:39.980> important<00:00:40.460> step<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:40.970> you<00:00:41.060> don't<00:00:41.210> have<00:00:41.420> some

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
an important step so you don't have some

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.860 
an important step so you don't have some
mushy<00:00:41.960> product<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.700> like<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.329> do<00:00:44.510> is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
mushy product and what I like to do is

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.170 
mushy product and what I like to do is
run<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.710> under<00:00:46.220> cool<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.809> warm<00:00:48.079> water<00:00:49.180> just

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.870 
run it under cool to warm water just
briefly<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.899> then<00:00:51.620> I'll<00:00:51.920> allow<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.610> sit

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
briefly and then I'll allow it to sit

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.959 
briefly and then I'll allow it to sit
and<00:00:53.149> drain<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.899> check<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:54.620> out<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.130> I'll

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
and drain and check it out and I'll

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.600 
and drain and check it out and I'll
repeat<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:56.840> process<00:00:57.110> until<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.829> can<00:00:58.129> see<00:00:58.399> that

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
repeat this process until I can see that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.959 
repeat this process until I can see that
they<00:00:58.820> are<00:00:58.850> truly<00:01:00.190> fouled<00:01:01.190> out<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.700> course

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
they are truly fouled out of course

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.729 
they are truly fouled out of course
they're<00:01:02.239> not<00:01:02.390> felled<00:01:02.719> yet<00:01:02.989> but<00:01:03.200> I'll<00:01:03.350> repeat

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
they're not felled yet but I'll repeat

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.069 
they're not felled yet but I'll repeat
that<00:01:03.950> until<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:05.000> see<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.269> filled<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.960> then

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
that until I see it filled and then

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.370 
that until I see it filled and then
we'll<00:01:06.200> be<00:01:06.320> right<00:01:06.500> back<00:01:07.270> my<00:01:08.270> cauliflower<00:01:08.630> has

a lot of different size pieces here we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.520 
a lot of different size pieces here we
have<00:01:33.890> some<00:01:34.100> very<00:01:34.280> small<00:01:34.610> very<00:01:35.299> large<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.229> what

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.649 
have some very small very large so what
I'm<00:01:36.740> going<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:38.110> just<00:01:39.729> trim<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.939> piece<00:01:41.330> or

I'm going to do is just trim a piece or
two<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:42.680> make<00:01:42.890> them<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.159> little<00:01:43.490> more<00:01:43.640> uniform

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
two to make them a little more uniform

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.300 
two to make them a little more uniform
in<00:01:44.450> size<00:01:44.509> now<00:01:45.080> this<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.530> not<00:01:45.710> something<00:01:46.040> to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
in size now this is not something to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.289 
in size now this is not something to
stress<00:01:46.580> over<00:01:47.140> really<00:01:48.140> ah<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.400> if<00:01:50.119> I

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
stress over really ah it's just if I

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.819 
stress over really ah it's just if I
make<00:01:50.509> them<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.720> little<00:01:50.930> more<00:01:51.049> uniform<00:01:51.350> in<00:01:51.799> size

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
make them a little more uniform in size

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.870 
make them a little more uniform in size
they're<00:01:52.759> going<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.270> roast<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:54.650> little<00:01:55.490> more<00:01:55.729> at

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
they're going to roast a little more at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.830 
they're going to roast a little more at
the<00:01:56.119> about<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.900> same<00:01:57.140> timeframe<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.840> that's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
the about the same timeframe so that's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200 
the about the same timeframe so that's
going<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.320> be<00:02:00.439> close<00:02:00.710> enough<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.520> not<00:02:01.880> that

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
going to be close enough it's not that

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.780 
going to be close enough it's not that
huge<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.259> deal<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:03.829> we<00:02:04.070> want<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.640> them

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
huge of a deal but we want to have them

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.229 
huge of a deal but we want to have them
as<00:02:04.880> close<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:05.329> we<00:02:05.479> can<00:02:06.070> okay<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.130> now<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.030> draw

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
as close as we can okay so now you draw

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
now bear in mind that when we're dealing

partially cooked and they're going to be

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.020 
partially cooked and they're going to be
cooking<00:04:03.470> at<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.709> different<00:04:04.129> rate<00:04:04.370> than<00:04:04.609> what<00:04:05.000> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030

fresh vegetable would so I'm going to
set<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.280> for<00:04:07.310> 10<00:04:07.669> minutes<00:04:07.909> just<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:08.989> can

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
set it for 10 minutes just so I can

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.240 
set it for 10 minutes just so I can
watch<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.620> very<00:04:10.129> frequently<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.209> then<00:04:12.250> stir

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
watch it very frequently and then stir

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.619 
watch it very frequently and then stir
them<00:04:13.430> around<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.849> little<00:04:13.970> bit<00:04:14.180> because<00:04:14.329> they're

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
them around a little bit because they're

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.870

going<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.840> start<00:04:15.079> to<00:04:15.229> brown<00:04:15.530> on<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:16.250> bottom

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
going to start to brown on the bottom

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.460 
going to start to brown on the bottom
and<00:04:17.229> um<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.849> I<00:04:20.180> see<00:04:20.539> that<00:04:20.570> they<00:04:20.900> need<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.139> lot

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
and um if I see that they need a lot

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.110 
and um if I see that they need a lot
more<00:04:21.769> time<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.490> cook<00:04:22.699> I'll<00:04:22.970> set<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.360> timer<00:04:23.539> for

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
more time to cook I'll set the timer for

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.050 
more time to cook I'll set the timer for
ten<00:04:24.600> minutes<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.400> if<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.520> see<00:04:26.699> that<00:04:26.730> they're

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
ten minutes and if I see that they're

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.909 
ten minutes and if I see that they're
getting<00:04:27.210> close<00:04:27.630> I'll<00:04:27.960> set<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.290> timer<00:04:28.530> for

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
getting close I'll set the timer for

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.700 
getting close I'll set the timer for
five<00:04:29.190> minutes<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:29.910> even<00:04:30.389> less<00:04:30.870> than<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.169> this

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
five minutes or even less than that this

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.450 
five minutes or even less than that this
way<00:04:32.070> you're<00:04:32.370> watching<00:04:33.030> them<00:04:33.240> often<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.460> there

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
way you're watching them often and there

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.100 
way you're watching them often and there
you<00:04:35.639> have<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.820> lot<00:04:36.090> less<00:04:36.330> chance<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.900> them

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
you have a lot less chance of them

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.790 
you have a lot less chance of them
burning<00:04:37.560> I'll<00:04:38.460> be<00:04:39.120> back<00:04:39.389> after<00:04:39.810> they've<00:04:40.500> been

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
want you to see what they're going to

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.370 
want you to see what they're going to
look<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:43.889> at<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.280> point<00:04:44.780> all<00:04:45.780> right<00:04:46.050> these

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
look like at that point all right these

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.070 
look like at that point all right these
have<00:04:46.800> been<00:04:46.949> in<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.250> oven<00:04:47.400> for<00:04:47.639> right<00:04:48.270> at<00:04:48.540> 10

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
have been in the oven for right at 10

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.159 
have been in the oven for right at 10
minutes<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.030> obviously<00:04:51.030> they're<00:04:51.600> not<00:04:51.720> cooked

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
minutes and obviously they're not cooked

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.780 
minutes and obviously they're not cooked
but<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.560> wanted<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> see<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.490> progress

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
but I wanted you to see the progress

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.840 
but I wanted you to see the progress
after<00:04:54.510> only<00:04:54.720> 10<00:04:55.110> minutes<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.560> time<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:56.639> can

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
after only 10 minutes of time you can

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.550 
after only 10 minutes of time you can
see<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.330> we're<00:04:57.540> starting<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.110> get<00:04:58.290> some

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
see that we're starting to get some

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.600 
see that we're starting to get some
brown<00:04:58.889> on<00:04:59.280> them<00:04:59.639> already<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.320> they<00:05:01.680> will<00:05:02.250> not

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
brown on them already so they will not

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.629 
brown on them already so they will not
need<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.389> take<00:05:03.630> as<00:05:03.900> long<00:05:04.320> as<00:05:04.740> if<00:05:05.280> they<00:05:05.580> were

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
need to take as long as if they were

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.600 
need to take as long as if they were
fresh<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.470> wanted<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.919> point<00:05:08.160> that<00:05:08.370> out

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
fresh so I wanted to point that out

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.580 
fresh so I wanted to point that out
really<00:05:09.090> strongly<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.930> they<00:05:10.080> cook<00:05:10.350> pretty

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
really strongly that they cook pretty

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.800 
really strongly that they cook pretty
quickly<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:11.610> I'm<00:05:12.000> just<00:05:12.210> going<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.479> stir<00:05:12.690> them

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
quickly and I'm just going to stir them

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.810 
quickly and I'm just going to stir them
around<00:05:12.930> just<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.500> little<00:05:13.770> bit<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.340> I'm<00:05:14.669> going

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
around just a little bit and I'm going

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.360 
around just a little bit and I'm going
to<00:05:14.940> put<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.720> back<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.200> oven<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.800> set<00:05:17.190> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
to put it back in the oven and set the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.379 
to put it back in the oven and set the
timer<00:05:17.669> for<00:05:18.330> another<00:05:18.900> 10<00:05:19.560> minutes

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
timer for another 10 minutes

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.270 
timer for another 10 minutes
all<00:05:21.389> right<00:05:21.600> this<00:05:21.810> cauliflower<00:05:22.530> has<00:05:22.919> roasted

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
all right this cauliflower has roasted

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.879 
all right this cauliflower has roasted
for<00:05:23.789> an<00:05:24.000> additional<00:05:24.630> 10<00:05:24.960> minutes<00:05:24.990> now<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.590> can

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
for an additional 10 minutes now you can

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.430 
for an additional 10 minutes now you can
see<00:05:26.100> that<00:05:27.000> may<00:05:27.270> have<00:05:27.449> actually<00:05:27.690> been<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:28.169> little

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
see that may have actually been a little

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.340 
see that may have actually been a little
bit<00:05:29.120> too<00:05:30.120> much<00:05:30.330> in<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.750> sense<00:05:30.990> we've<00:05:31.139> got<00:05:31.320> a

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
bit too much in the sense we've got a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.430 
bit too much in the sense we've got a
little<00:05:31.590> bit<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.889> burn<00:05:32.100> on<00:05:32.400> there<00:05:32.720> but<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:33.930> think

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
little bit of burn on there but I think

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.580 
little bit of burn on there but I think
these<00:05:34.740> are<00:05:34.950> done<00:05:35.539> eight<00:05:36.539> minutes<00:05:37.080> may<00:05:37.320> have

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
these are done eight minutes may have

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.870 
these are done eight minutes may have
been<00:05:37.800> fine

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
been fine

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.010 
been fine
it<00:05:39.080> really<00:05:40.080> depends<00:05:40.950> upon<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.810> type<00:05:42.810> of

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
it really depends upon the type of

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.980 
it really depends upon the type of
vegetable<00:05:43.500> you've<00:05:43.740> got<00:05:44.039> how<00:05:45.000> big<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.479> pieces

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
vegetable you've got how big the pieces

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.279 
vegetable you've got how big the pieces
are<00:05:46.340> how<00:05:47.340> tender<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.090> vegetable<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:49.110> begin

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
are how tender the vegetable is to begin

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.500 
are how tender the vegetable is to begin
with<00:05:49.530> as<00:05:50.310> far<00:05:50.580> as<00:05:50.669> how<00:05:50.910> long<00:05:50.940> it's<00:05:51.300> going<00:05:51.450> to

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
with as far as how long it's going to

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.629 
with as far as how long it's going to
take<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.080> can<00:05:52.349> see<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:52.710> takes<00:05:52.979> nowhere

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
take but you can see it takes nowhere

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.300 
take but you can see it takes nowhere
near<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.210> time<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.870> roast<00:05:55.080> frozen<00:05:55.800> vegetables
