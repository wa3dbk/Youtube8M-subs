00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
expecting the lease pick because he's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100

great Elise he likes to play that
champion<00:00:37.410> while<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.620> puts<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> pressure

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
champion while he puts a lot of pressure

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
champion while he puts a lot of pressure
on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> map<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.120> were<00:00:39.390> surprised<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:39.960> he

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
on the map so we were surprised when he

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.959 
on the map so we were surprised when he
decided<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.530> gragas<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.399> release<00:00:41.670> which

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
decided to go gragas over release which

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I think he's done really well on all

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
I think he's done really well on all
right<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> seeing<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.239> Gragas<00:00:45.840> jungle<00:00:46.230> come

and<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.470> lot<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.040> pressure<00:01:17.310> came<00:01:17.670> from

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and a lot of that pressure came from

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
and a lot of that pressure came from
shifter<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> mid<00:01:18.900> lane<00:01:19.080> he<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.770> up

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
shifter in the mid lane he was going up

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
shifter in the mid lane he was going up
against<00:01:20.159> PO<00:01:20.400> Beltre<00:01:20.729> who<00:01:20.820> has<00:01:20.909> had<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
against PO Beltre who has had a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
against PO Beltre who has had a
fantastic<00:01:21.689> rise<00:01:22.110> game<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> finish

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
fantastic rise game from start to finish

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.760 
fantastic rise game from start to finish
but<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:23.970> shifter<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.320> clicked<00:01:25.619> on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but then shifter kind of just clicked on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
but then shifter kind of just clicked on
and<00:01:25.979> started<00:01:26.159> getting<00:01:26.369> pics<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> krepo<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and started getting pics on krepo and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
and started getting pics on krepo and
I'll<00:01:27.330> cross<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> having<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> strength

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'll cross that and having the strength

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
I'll cross that and having the strength
of<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.829> mid<00:01:29.070> laner<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:30.060> for

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
of your mid laner what does that do for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
of your mid laner what does that do for
your<00:01:30.420> team<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> open<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> map<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> do

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
your team just to open up the map and do

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
your team just to open up the map and do
what<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.880> best<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:34.049> shifter<00:01:34.350> does

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
what you do best I think shifter does

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.690 
what you do best I think shifter does
really<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.890> champions<00:01:35.369> where<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.579> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
really well on champions where he can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
really well on champions where he can
get<00:01:35.820> pics<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.240> people<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.750> he's<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
get pics on people because he's really

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.359 
get pics on people because he's really
good<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.380> abusing<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> vision<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.159> things

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
good at abusing the vision and things

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
good at abusing the vision and things
like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.630> he<00:01:39.750> gets<00:01:39.960> pics

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like that so I think when he gets pics

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630 
like that so I think when he gets pics
like<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.860> opens<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
like that that just opens up a lot of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.039 
like that that just opens up a lot of
the<00:01:41.790> map<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.180> us<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.509> yeah<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:42.840> definitely

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the map for us and yeah he definitely

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
the map for us and yeah he definitely
did<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> work<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> game<00:01:44.159> along<00:01:44.640> with

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

when you see something like that does

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 
when you see something like that does
that<00:02:12.239> allow<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:12.959> build

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that allow you to then build

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
that allow you to then build
a little<00:02:14.070> bit<00:02:14.190> differently<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.820> kind<00:02:15.090> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
a little bit differently and kind of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.050 
a little bit differently and kind of
play<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.660> own<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.500> he's<00:02:17.340> taking<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
play your own game as he's taking the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.730 
play your own game as he's taking the
weight<00:02:18.210> off<00:02:18.240> your<00:02:18.360> shoulders<00:02:18.510> um<00:02:19.050> yeah<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
weight off your shoulders um yeah that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.530 
weight off your shoulders um yeah that
kind<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.520> teamfights<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.090> terms<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> them

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
kind of in teamfights in terms of them

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.640 
kind of in teamfights in terms of them
building<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> lot<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.020> magic<00:02:22.260> resist<00:02:22.530> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
building a lot of magic resist that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.960 
building a lot of magic resist that
definitely<00:02:22.920> helps<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.160> ad<00:02:23.340> carry<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
definitely helps the ad carry out the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.130 
definitely helps the ad carry out the
most<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.960> those

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
most because they have all those

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.050 
most because they have all those
negatron<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.950> cutie<00:02:26.250> pie<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.730> rip

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
negatron so cutie pie can just rip

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.580 
negatron so cutie pie can just rip
through<00:02:27.360> them<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.870> helps<00:02:27.990> me<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> little<00:02:28.440> bit

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
through them it helps me a little bit

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.200 
through them it helps me a little bit
because<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.890> Jax<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.790> saw<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.060> game

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
because I'm Jax but as you saw that game

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.970 
because I'm Jax but as you saw that game
I<00:02:30.300> was<00:02:30.390> mostly<00:02:30.600> split<00:02:31.020> pushing<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.530> flanking

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
I was mostly split pushing and flanking

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.040 
I was mostly split pushing and flanking
so<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.670> wasn't<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.300> trying<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so I wasn't really trying to do that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.300 
so I wasn't really trying to do that
much<00:02:34.170> damage<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> Champions<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.220> all

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
much damage on the Champions it's all

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
much damage on the Champions it's all
about<00:02:35.520> my<00:02:35.700> pressure<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.270> map<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> think

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
about my pressure on the map so I think

tanki items right I'll banshees veils

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.280 
tanki items right I'll banshees veils
across<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> board<00:03:32.580> lots<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.910> health<00:03:33.090> how<00:03:33.780> do

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
across the board lots of health how do

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
across the board lots of health how do
teamfights<00:03:34.830> evolve<00:03:35.250> when<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.610> get<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.850> that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
teamfights evolve when you get to that

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.390 
teamfights evolve when you get to that
point<00:03:36.030> right<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.260> see<00:03:37.530> all<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.070> same<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
point right at you see all the same is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.550 
point right at you see all the same is
positioning<00:03:38.970> targeting<00:03:39.540> burst<00:03:39.900> potential

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
positioning targeting burst potential

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.830 
positioning targeting burst potential
where<00:03:41.310> does<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.489> start<00:03:41.760> okay<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.510> later<00:03:42.660> it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
where does it start okay so the later it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.510 
where does it start okay so the later it
goes<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.170> teamfight<00:03:43.440> one<00:03:43.830> missed<00:03:44.070> position

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
goes on a teamfight one missed position

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.490 
goes on a teamfight one missed position
from<00:03:44.610> even<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.000> tank<00:03:45.270> can<00:03:45.510> lose<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.870> fight<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
from even a tank can lose you a fight so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900 
from even a tank can lose you a fight so
they<00:03:46.739> started<00:03:47.040> building<00:03:47.160> tanky<00:03:47.640> because<00:03:47.850> they

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
they started building tanky because they

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.340 
they started building tanky because they
didn't<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.270> get<00:03:48.330> one<00:03:48.510> shot<00:03:48.690> from<00:03:48.900> syndra

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
didn't want to get one shot from syndra

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.260 
didn't want to get one shot from syndra
and<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.950> did<00:03:50.100> alleviate<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.760> little<00:03:51.090> bit<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and that did alleviate a little bit of

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.430 
and that did alleviate a little bit of
pressure<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.630> us<00:03:51.720> from<00:03:51.900> them<00:03:52.050> having<00:03:52.290> less

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
pressure for us from them having less

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.990 
pressure for us from them having less
damage<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.400> team<00:03:53.580> fight<00:03:53.760> what<00:03:53.880> was

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
damage but in that team fight what was

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.670 
damage but in that team fight what was
most<00:03:54.180> important<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.959> knowing<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
most important was just knowing the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.990 
most important was just knowing the
range<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.100> their<00:03:56.220> carries<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.640> know<00:03:56.670> rise

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
range of their carries you know rise

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
that and you saw it's just abusing the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.870 
that and you saw it's just abusing the
long<00:04:10.230> range<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.590> syndra<00:04:10.950> abusing<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.670> range

that's<00:04:13.440> what<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:13.769> allowed<00:04:13.860> us<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.310> just

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
that's what really allowed us to just

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.159 
that's what really allowed us to just
play<00:04:14.880> around<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.600> fact<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.900> they<00:04:16.049> had

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
hoping they could pull that through but

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.270 
hoping they could pull that through but
yeah<00:04:34.230> we're<00:04:34.350> definitely<00:04:34.470> at<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.890> standings

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
yeah we're definitely at the standings

yeah we're definitely at the standings
it<00:04:35.400> doesn't<00:04:35.670> really<00:04:35.760> matter<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.090> much

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it doesn't really matter that much

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.270 
it doesn't really matter that much
because<00:04:36.510> it's<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:37.020> we<00:04:37.530> can<00:04:37.680> win<00:04:37.830> all<00:04:37.980> our<00:04:38.130> games

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
because it's if we can win all our games

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.350 
because it's if we can win all our games
because<00:04:38.520> eventually<00:04:38.760> we're<00:04:39.060> going<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.240> play

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
because eventually we're going to play

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360 
because eventually we're going to play
CLG<00:04:39.810> again<00:04:40.080> haven't<00:04:40.710> done<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.980> well<00:04:41.130> against

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
CLG again haven't done so well against

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.250 
CLG again haven't done so well against
them<00:04:41.520> in<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.640> LCS<00:04:41.970> but<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.510> we'll<00:04:42.660> have<00:04:43.200> a

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
them in the LCS but I think we'll have a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.770 
them in the LCS but I think we'll have a
better<00:04:43.470> match<00:04:44.280> next<00:04:44.550> time<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.000> yeah<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.690> think

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
better match next time and yeah I think

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.820 
better match next time and yeah I think
it<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:45.990> really<00:04:46.230> matters<00:04:46.470> if<00:04:46.590> we<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.800> just

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
it just really matters if we can just

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.870 
it just really matters if we can just
keep<00:04:47.010> getting<00:04:47.280> better<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.550> learning<00:04:47.850> from

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
keep getting better and learning from

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.220 
keep getting better and learning from
our<00:04:48.090> mistakes<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.600> hope<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.870> can<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.110> keep

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
our mistakes so I hope we can just keep

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.560 
our mistakes so I hope we can just keep
improving<00:04:49.530> from<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.010> final<00:04:50.730> question<00:04:51.150> you
