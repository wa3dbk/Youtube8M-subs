00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
three races on were almost in a very

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.669 
three races on were almost in a very
dominating<00:01:03.789> force<00:01:04.789> that<00:01:05.690> was<00:01:05.899> real<00:01:06.229> cool<00:01:06.500> and

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
dominating force that was real cool and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:31.990 
dominating force that was real cool and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.700 

so<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:32.960> feeling<00:01:33.140> when<00:01:33.350> you're<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.680> car

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
so the feeling when you're in the car

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.480 
so the feeling when you're in the car
when<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.730> boost<00:01:34.940> kicks<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.950> it's<00:01:36.950> an<00:01:37.100> amazing

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
when that boost kicks in it's an amazing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.580 
when that boost kicks in it's an amazing
feeling<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.030> really<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.660> pushes<00:01:39.440> your<00:01:39.530> head

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
feeling it really is it pushes your head

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.250 
feeling it really is it pushes your head
back<00:01:39.890> into<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.370> headrest<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:42.080> never

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
back into the headrest and you never

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.320 
back into the headrest and you never
want<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.590> stop<00:01:42.830> but<00:01:43.430> unfortunately<00:01:44.180> it

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
want it to stop but unfortunately it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.660 
want it to stop but unfortunately it
does<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.890> you're<00:01:45.890> back<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> combustion

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
does and you're back to the combustion

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.980 
does and you're back to the combustion
engine<00:01:47.150> but<00:01:47.330> when<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.540> have<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.810> two

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
engine but when you have the two

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.780 
engine but when you have the two
combined<00:01:48.410> together<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:49.010> hybrid<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.580> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
combined together the hybrid and the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:09.820 
combined together the hybrid and the
combustion<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.140> seriously<00:01:51.590> fast<00:01:51.890> car

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:34.940 

ah

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.170 

it's<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> great<00:02:36.160> feeling<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.700> back<00:02:36.970> at<00:02:37.150> the
