00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.540
 as Ukrainian truth reports 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 in front of us 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.900
 belonged to the beginning of the vote 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.669
 Further 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 Further 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.409
 given the rapid 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.409
 aging 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 found a typo 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.879
 with this project 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.879
 kWh 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 step 5 thousand 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.410
 recall 210 units of equipment 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 children and 4 4 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 diagram 4 4 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.240
 2 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 it's fine 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 among nominees 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 According to JSC Naftan 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.670
 took place 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 if i have listed already 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.760
 was 3 meters per second 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 after graduation 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.660
 still not killed 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.650
 two weeks 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.460
 new program 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.069
 and i'm a minute 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 I love 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.149
 in the end we get ria news 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.539
 whereas at the beginning as a result it happens 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.339
 according to apa 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.499
 it is also proposed to raise 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.639
 at 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.169
 but 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.369
 square 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.459
 it has analogues in the world 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.269
 rather strange 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.269
 if you encounter 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 it explains more precisely 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
 to find 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.659
 I ask you at least 4 5
