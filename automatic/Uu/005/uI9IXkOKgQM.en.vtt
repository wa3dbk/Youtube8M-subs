00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.040
 welcome to the kitchen hello 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.630
 Today it's about technology and that's why 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.160
 maybe it's a bit complicated 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 but otherwise I hope you find it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.070
 still interesting and stay tuned 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 Today it is about depth of field 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 just like the human eye 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.619
 yes focused the lens of a camera 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
 a certain point that's what's in focus 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.720
 is not that schaaf what is not in focus 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 is less is supposed to hurt me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.550
 I've been here for a few years now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.390
 the possibility with digital 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 also to videos 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 do 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.489
 this results in the possibility of much 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.989
 to play more with the sharpness levels 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.460
 as it was before the case one 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.590
 mirror reflex camera owns namely 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 a much larger image sensor than one 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 conventional video camera now asks her 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.239
 you maybe what an image sensor 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 that's what I'm going to do to you now 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 explain briefly here you see one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 SLR camera that is the lens 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.890
 I'll take a short break now 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 Here you can see the image sensor of the camera 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 the photosensitive sensor converts 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.039
 the image from the lens into digital data 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.989
 around that now a simple little one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.970
 Video camera taken apart this time 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.100
 and here you see the sensor of this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 camera you see it so much as much 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 smaller than the SLR camera 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.350
 the larger the sensor the lower the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.119
 depth of field 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 also plays the so-called 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.430
 blind one inside the lens 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 role 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600
 that's one of her dazzling about 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 so looks and the bigger the opening 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 this aperture is the lower the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.600
 Selective focus and the more light 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.909
 bring it through and the farther you go 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.610
 closed is the less light 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.299
 brings through and the bigger it is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.430
 depth of field 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 As you can see , the blind is this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.700
 Objectively straight because of the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.829
 background which is relatively blurred 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.939
 only the aperture lower from it 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.710
 The result is also the kitchen in the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.090
 background sharp is the result 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 resulting light loss is due 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.149
 the camera compensated what are the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.579
 Advantages and what are the disadvantages 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.020
 a slight depth of field through a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.700
 little depth of field you have one 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.189
 further possibility of the picture design 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.480
 so you can for example some things in 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.070
 to highlight the sharpness and others 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.420
 background disappear too 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.220
 the possibility of sharpness arises 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.600
 Shifting by a sharpness 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.490
 one can shift the view of the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.050
 observer steer more inconspicuously than it 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.630
 For example, I can swivel 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.680
 become 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 the disadvantage of a low 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.380
 Selective focus is that it is very much 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 more noticeable is when the focus is wrong 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.130
 is set just because most 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.900
 mirror cameras do not have one 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.670
 have autofocus that's special 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.990
 then a problem when doing blogs 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.910
 and you have someone around you 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.140
 Camera cares 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.510
 as you can see by a small one 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.200
 Selective focus a new one 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.760
 to gain creative opportunity 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.680
 if you use them properly 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 on the other side you have to consider 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.240
 that since the development of the video dsl 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.860
 first everyone has the opportunity and 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.480
 That's why this look does not matter 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.010
 more as special as it used to be 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.150
 yes I hope that was interesting again 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.200
 for you and she has a little something 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.730
 can learn 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 and if there are other topics from the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.910
 she writes film and video department 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.320
 but just down there in the comments 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.210
 and I hope to see you again soon 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.480
 in the kitchen of your confidence until then 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.480
 Zschau
