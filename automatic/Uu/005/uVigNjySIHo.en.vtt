00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.960
 with only 24 years old the sergio base 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.090
 llull has already been twice champion 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.040
 Europe with the Spanish national team its 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.080
 next big challenge will take place in the 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.119
 london olympics together with their 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.869
 selection partners but before 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.730
 split 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.350
 sergio llull submits to our 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.940
 particular about this olympic 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.940
 they are in london 2012 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 it is a dream 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.590
 an Olympic medal would be 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.260
 It is the culmination of a dream 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.300
 I would ask for a picture of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 grandÃ­simos athletes but no longer 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 would not stay with usain bolt a bit of 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.570
 music 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.150
 I like listening to hip hop 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.309
 not a book or a television series 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.030
 I still do not have my suitcase made but 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.810
 but surely I do a series more than 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.700
 medieval books 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.430
 what are the colors of the rings 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 olympics 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.060
 blue green yellow black 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.640
 and red 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.560
 how 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.610
 what is your photo of the history of the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.340
 olympic games 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.140
 and I would keep the photo of mate 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.300
 rudy in the face of the latest game 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.030
 olympics getting the medal of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.670
 silver will beat Spain's record of 22 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.650
 Olympic medals 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.799
 well let's hope that if the sport 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.470
 Spanish is in very good health and I think 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.850
 that every year goes more 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.320
 that you can beat that date 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.540
 a promise if you win a medal 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.300
 I do not like too much the subject of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.720
 promises because then the thing goes 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.229
 but well I think that if we get 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.229
 we will celebrate in a big way
