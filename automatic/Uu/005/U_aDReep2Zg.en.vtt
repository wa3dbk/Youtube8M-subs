00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
sounds better when you slow it down a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.460 
sounds better when you slow it down a
little<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.630> here's<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> intro<00:00:31.410> is

gonna<00:00:31.650> sound

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.270 

all<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:45.260> we're<00:00:45.410> gonna<00:00:45.470> start<00:00:45.560> with<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.830> C

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
all right so we're gonna start with a C

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.780 
all right so we're gonna start with a C
chord<00:00:46.520> over<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:48.620> index<00:00:49.160> finger<00:00:49.550> on

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
chord over here that is index finger on

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.630 
chord over here that is index finger on
the<00:00:50.060> first<00:00:50.330> string<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.310> first<00:00:52.310> fret<00:00:52.460> of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
the first string of the first fret of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.030 
the first string of the first fret of
the<00:00:52.790> B<00:00:52.940> string<00:00:53.320> your<00:00:54.320> middle<00:00:54.380> finger<00:00:54.800> is

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
the B string your middle finger is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.880 
the B string your middle finger is
second<00:00:55.850> fret<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.300> D<00:00:56.750> string<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.380> your

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
second fret of the D string and your

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330 
second fret of the D string and your
ring<00:00:58.340> finger<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.739> third<00:01:00.739> fret<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.250> a

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
ring finger is third fret of the a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.430 
ring finger is third fret of the a
string<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:03.530> got<00:01:03.650> our<00:01:03.739> C<00:01:03.920> chord<00:01:04.190> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
string so we got our C chord and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.250 
string so we got our C chord and
basically<00:01:06.440> you're<00:01:06.590> gonna<00:01:06.680> pluck<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:08.050> b<00:01:09.050> g<00:01:10.660> d<00:01:12.970> BG

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
basically you're gonna pluck a b g d BG

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:32.819 
basically you're gonna pluck a b g d BG
so<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:17.619> g<00:01:18.940> d<00:01:20.500> b<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> first<00:01:24.200> part

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.530 

and<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.310> intro<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.760> pretty<00:03:13.000> tough<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.450> you

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
and this intro is pretty tough if you

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.729 
and this intro is pretty tough if you
don't<00:03:13.690> get<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> at<00:03:13.959> first<00:03:14.110> then<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.620> keep

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
don't get it at first then just keep

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.910 
don't get it at first then just keep
practicing<00:03:15.989> when<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.020> first<00:03:17.290> learned<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.709> had

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
practicing when I first learned it I had

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.460 
practicing when I first learned it I had
to<00:03:18.010> start<00:03:18.220> playing<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> slow<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:20.290> just

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
to start playing it slow and then just

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.850 
to start playing it slow and then just
try<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.680> play<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.160> faster<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.640> faster<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> I

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
try to play it faster and faster so I

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.720 
try to play it faster and faster so I
just<00:03:24.010> started<00:03:24.250> off<00:03:24.370> really<00:03:24.670> slow

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
just started off really slow

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.760 
just started off really slow
I<00:03:26.760> mean<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.330> kind<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.170> picked<00:03:28.379> up<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> pace
