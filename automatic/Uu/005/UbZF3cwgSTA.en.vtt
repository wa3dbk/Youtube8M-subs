they<00:02:18.200> went<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.950> plans<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.370> people<00:02:31.730> didn't

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
they went to plans so that people didn't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.550 
they went to plans so that people didn't
have<00:02:32.030> any<00:02:32.270> place<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.630> go<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.140> go<00:02:33.170> there

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
have any place to go they can go there

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and now they're gradually filtering back

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.460 
and now they're gradually filtering back
in<00:02:39.970> whatever<00:02:40.970> whatever<00:02:41.450> happens<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.200> left

nature really is never-ending and we
can't<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.720> fully<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.140> an<00:04:16.260> appreciation

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
can't have fully have an appreciation

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.280 
can't have fully have an appreciation
for<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.190> until<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.640> see<00:04:17.850> people<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.360> him<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
for it until we see people like him in a

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.229 
for it until we see people like him in a
town<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.530> Pilger<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.549> where<00:04:20.790> people<00:04:21.090> have

town like Pilger and where people have

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.020 
town like Pilger and where people have
to<00:04:21.390> come<00:04:21.540> together<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:22.590> help<00:04:22.740> rebuild<00:04:23.220> yes<00:04:23.790> so

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
to come together to help rebuild yes so

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.570

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
but that's an indication of you know a

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.750 
but that's an indication of you know a
very<00:04:51.780> powerful<00:04:52.110> photo<00:04:52.740> that's<00:04:53.010> in<00:04:53.190> text<00:04:53.550> books

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
very powerful photo that's in text books

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.820 
very powerful photo that's in text books
meteorology<00:04:54.390> textbooks<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.380> video<00:04:55.650> that

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
meteorology textbooks but the video that

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.740 
meteorology textbooks but the video that
we<00:04:55.920> saw<00:04:56.160> unfolding<00:04:56.850> last<00:04:57.090> night<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.570> something

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
we saw unfolding last night is something

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.930 
we saw unfolding last night is something
that<00:04:58.080> many<00:04:58.800> meteorologists<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.490> myself

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
that many meteorologists like myself

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.270 
that many meteorologists like myself
included<00:05:00.720> have<00:05:00.840> not<00:05:01.050> seen<00:05:01.410> incredible<00:05:01.980> video

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
included have not seen incredible video

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.460 
included have not seen incredible video
of<00:05:03.270> these<00:05:03.810> very<00:05:04.320> violent<00:05:05.720> storms<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.050> close

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
of these very violent storms so close

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.260 
of these very violent storms so close
together<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:07.950> two<00:05:08.130> tornadoes<00:05:08.850> coming<00:05:09.090> from

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
together so two tornadoes coming from

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.860 
together so two tornadoes coming from
the<00:05:09.390> parent<00:05:09.780> supercell

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
the parent supercell

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.440 
the parent supercell
so<00:05:10.990> close<00:05:11.290> together<00:05:11.560> Gretchen<00:05:12.220> is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
so close together Gretchen is

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.450 
so close together Gretchen is
extraordinarily<00:05:13.450> rare<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.950> know<00:05:15.070> with<00:05:15.220> storm

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
extraordinarily rare you know with storm

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.950 
extraordinarily rare you know with storm
chasers<00:05:15.850> on<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.120> ground<00:05:16.330> like<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:16.570> maybe

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
chasers on the ground like this maybe

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.380 
chasers on the ground like this maybe
we'll<00:05:17.230> see<00:05:17.410> more<00:05:17.590> video<00:05:17.920> like<00:05:18.130> this<00:05:18.370> but<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.270> is

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
we'll see more video like this but it is

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.150 
we'll see more video like this but it is
rare<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.870> certainly<00:05:20.320> meteorologists<00:05:21.070> will

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
rare and certainly meteorologists will

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.500 
rare and certainly meteorologists will
be<00:05:21.280> studying<00:05:21.640> this<00:05:21.760> video<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.120> get<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> better

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
be studying this video to get a better

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.870 
be studying this video to get a better
handle<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:23.140> how<00:05:23.320> tornadoes<00:05:23.920> happen<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.670> where

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
handle of how tornadoes happen and where

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.730 
handle of how tornadoes happen and where
they<00:05:25.000> happened<00:05:25.390> Janice<00:05:25.870> thank<00:05:26.290> you<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:26.590> much

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
they happened Janice thank you so much

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
they happened Janice thank you so much
and<00:05:26.890> we<00:05:26.950> hope<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.160> don't<00:05:27.340> see<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.520> anytime

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
and we hope you don't see it anytime

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.170
