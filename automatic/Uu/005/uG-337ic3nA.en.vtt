00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.680 
these butterflies on the other fingers
so<00:04:08.410> it's<00:04:08.710> almost<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.580> little<00:04:09.760> different

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
so it's almost a little different

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.430 
so it's almost a little different
variety<00:04:11.080> of<00:04:11.110> butterflies<00:04:11.560> each<00:04:11.830> finger<00:04:12.210> ok<00:04:13.440> so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
variety of butterflies each finger ok so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.320 
variety of butterflies each finger ok so
now<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.040> have<00:04:15.280> left<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.610> do<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:15.880> clean<00:04:16.390> up

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
now all I have left to do is clean up

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.550 
now all I have left to do is clean up
which<00:04:19.330> is<00:04:19.540> going<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.900> take<00:04:20.170> me<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.380> while

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
which is going to take me a while

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040 
which is going to take me a while
because<00:04:20.860> the<00:04:21.190> sponging<00:04:21.700> always<00:04:22.270> makes<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.840> a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
because the sponging always makes it a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.270 
because the sponging always makes it a
little<00:04:23.320> bit<00:04:23.560> more<00:04:24.780> messy

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.000 

so<00:04:32.030> once<00:04:32.270> i'm<00:04:32.480> done<00:04:32.510> cleaning<00:04:32.960> up<00:04:33.170> i<00:04:33.380> will<00:04:33.500> top

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
so once i'm done cleaning up i will top

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.350 
so once i'm done cleaning up i will top
coat<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.610> i<00:04:34.639> will<00:04:34.820> have<00:04:34.970> some<00:04:35.180> pictures
