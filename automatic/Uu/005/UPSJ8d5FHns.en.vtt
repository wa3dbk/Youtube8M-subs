this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:01.079> LG<00:00:01.319> optimus<00:00:02.179> g<00:00:03.179> pro<00:00:03.589> it's<00:00:04.589> got<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
this is the LG optimus g pro it's got a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.960 
this is the LG optimus g pro it's got a
Snapdragon<00:00:06.080> 600<00:00:07.080> quad-core<00:00:07.350> processor<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor it

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.160 
Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor it
runs<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.769> 1.7<00:00:10.769> gigahertz<00:00:11.070> also<00:00:11.700> got<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> 400<00:00:12.570> PPI

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
runs at 1.7 gigahertz also got a 400 PPI

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.589 
runs at 1.7 gigahertz also got a 400 PPI
the<00:00:14.040> maximum<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> conceived<00:00:15.299> we've<00:00:15.450> got

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the maximum the I conceived we've got

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.500 
the maximum the I conceived we've got
twenty-twenty<00:00:16.049> vision<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:17.039> 77<00:00:17.699> ppi<00:00:18.090> so

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
twenty-twenty vision is for 77 ppi so

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
twenty-twenty vision is for 77 ppi so
we're<00:00:18.660> getting<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:18.960> close<00:00:19.760> some<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
we're getting pretty close some of the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210 
we're getting pretty close some of the
nice<00:00:21.180> functions<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.410> features<00:00:22.590> are<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
nice functions and features are the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.650 
nice functions and features are the
qslide<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.560> playing<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.099> full<00:00:26.699> HD<00:00:27.300> video

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
qslide so I'm playing this full HD video

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929 
qslide so I'm playing this full HD video
here<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> does<00:00:28.500> run<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.859> full<00:00:29.099> HD<00:00:29.640> are

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
here because it does run on full HD are

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.299 
here because it does run on full HD are
handsome<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:31.710> minimize<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.730> video

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
handsome you can then minimize the video

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.790 
handsome you can then minimize the video
like<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.719> remove<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> video<00:00:37.469> around

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like so you can remove the video around

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.660 
like so you can remove the video around
the<00:00:38.010> screen<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> change<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.469> shape<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the screen you can change the shape and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
the screen you can change the shape and
size<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.020> top<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.500> can

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
size and then on top of that you can

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.799 
size and then on top of that you can
change<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.070> transparency<00:00:44.430> level<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.690> go

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
change the transparency level let's go

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
change the transparency level let's go
to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> video<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.829> stay<00:00:47.070> running<00:00:47.489> as

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to do and the video will stay running as

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.139 
to do and the video will stay running as
you<00:00:47.940> open<00:00:48.360> multiple<00:00:48.739> applications<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you open multiple applications so and so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.990 
you open multiple applications so and so
you're<00:00:51.300> using<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.870> calculator<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you're using the calculator and then you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.580 
you're using the calculator and then you
can<00:00:54.149> minimize<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.199> well<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
can minimize that one down as well and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
can minimize that one down as well and
that<00:00:55.680> becomes<00:00:55.920> park<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.640> slide<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that becomes park you slide and then you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
that becomes park you slide and then you
can<00:00:58.230> even<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.770> top<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> add<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> third

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
can even on top of that add a third

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.740 
can even on top of that add a third
application<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.020> even<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> calendar

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
application so even the calendar

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.369 
application so even the calendar
remembering<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.840> we've<00:01:03.989> still<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
remembering that we've still got the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
remembering that we've still got the
video<00:01:04.619> running<00:01:04.920> underneath<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.229> ask

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
video running underneath so you can ask

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
video running underneath so you can ask
me<00:01:07.680> applications<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.610> running<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.570> who

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
me applications all running at one who

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.330 
me applications all running at one who
the<00:01:10.020> function<00:01:10.380> another<00:01:10.680> thing<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> g

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the function another thing about the g

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.140 
the function another thing about the g
pro<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.909> we've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.990> cube<00:01:13.320> remote<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pro is we've got cube remote so you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
pro is we've got cube remote so you can

phones have gone like cheese shutter
thing<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.259> tell<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.649> camera<00:01:56.859> cheese<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.490> it

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
thing we tell the camera cheese and it

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.160 
thing we tell the camera cheese and it
will<00:01:57.759> take<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.119> picture<00:01:58.509> which<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.959> quite

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
will take the picture which is quite

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.429 
will take the picture which is quite
nice<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.869> variable<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:01.990> various<00:02:02.289> other
