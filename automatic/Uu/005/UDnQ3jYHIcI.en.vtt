kite we have all different sizes and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.570 
kite we have all different sizes and
shapes<00:00:16.320> according<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> wind<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
shapes according to what the wind is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.000 
shapes according to what the wind is
gonna<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.029> us<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.810> real<00:00:19.350> light<00:00:19.590> wind<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
gonna do for us from real light wind to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.990 
gonna do for us from real light wind to
real<00:00:20.160> heavy<00:00:20.430> wind

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
real heavy wind

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.540 
real heavy wind
so<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.630> fly<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> kite<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.160> use<00:00:23.340> these

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
so we fly the kite and then we use these

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
so we fly the kite and then we use these
fancy<00:00:24.000> kite<00:00:24.510> rods<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> reels<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.680> here

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
fancy kite rods and reels like this here

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
fancy kite rods and reels like this here
now<00:00:26.160> these<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.490> electric<00:00:26.849> reels<00:00:27.289> we're<00:00:28.289> gonna

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
now these are electric reels we're gonna

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.410 
now these are electric reels we're gonna
let<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.580> 300<00:00:30.119> feet<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
let this thing go up about 300 feet in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.020 
let this thing go up about 300 feet in
the<00:00:30.510> air<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.590> by<00:00:32.219> having<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> electric

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the air and then by having the electric

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
the air and then by having the electric
you<00:00:33.149> don't<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.719> gain<00:00:34.110> wind<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you don't have to gain wind them up and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.580 
you don't have to gain wind them up and
down<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> kite<00:00:35.940> rods<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:37.350> fly<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
down so we get the kite rods to fly the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.360 
down so we get the kite rods to fly the
kites<00:00:38.000> then<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.070> setup<00:00:41.070> says

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
kites then as you see the setup says

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
kites then as you see the setup says
