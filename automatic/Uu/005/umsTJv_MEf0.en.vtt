 Kobzon 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 deleted not at the insistence of the spouse but from 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.070
 feelings of shame in the common causes of all 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 a different tattoo can get bored 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.340

 the easiest experts are old tattoo 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 block new procedure 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 called cover up the main problem in 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 which we encounter when performing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.920
 carpet on this is impossible to overlap 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.010
 darker pigments are lighter 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 what used to be practiced by many 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 tattoo artist until recently 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.289
 an experienced master had to think through 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.570
 sketch so that its dark places 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.960
 blocked old tattoo 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.000
 from this drawing was more contrast 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 but naturally big this method was 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.930
 effective only in case of small and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 much brightened tattoos while 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.410
 A new drawing does not always coincide with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.890
 flower 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.690
 so before fixing the old one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 tattoo new and best to start 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.430

 tattoo removal was done 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.690
 removal of skin in which 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.479
 contained pigment that resulted 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.350
 directly to the formation of scars or 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.220
 scarring on the skin 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.509
 now there are more humane ways 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.520
 one of the most progressive 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.619
 at the moment of time ways 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 is the selective photo method 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.740
 cavitation for this procedure 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.110
 is necessary 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.030
 neodymium or solid state laser removal 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.460
 occurs by acting on 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.860
 laser dye 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.530
 a certain wavelength which 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.950
 destroys the pigment granules being in 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.220
 skin 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.330
 lightening itself does not happen instantly 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.880
 crushed pigment is derived from 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 organism for one or two 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 months generally for removal 1 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.780
 tattoos average needed 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.660

 from 5 to 10 procedures the interval between 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.010

 all tattoos can be removed 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.380
 completely and depends on big 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.420
 the number of factors to predict which 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.280
 are not possible on average price 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.220
