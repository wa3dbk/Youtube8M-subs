00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.710
 I greet him saying the beard black 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.620
 or I know it's petrus german 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.659
 answer was absolutely accurate you show us 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.099
 Here you can see at the fair 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.220
 again we play ourselves , of course we see 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.989
 is clearly nothing else 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.480
 Product specific if the man with 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.699
 the beard and, of course, when it comes to value 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.169
 goes and goes richie plays 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.819
 of course the original production the 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.349
 majesty just right petrucci the 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.700
 MÃ¤rkische allee between presented and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.530
 Allocated spoken there is one 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 some new variants for a very 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.970
 Pretty as I think 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.620
 from the series of hot precious metal 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.210
 stop in this beautiful gold or 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.190
 still in a silver i find it quite 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.180
 chic or shit from the specs though 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.230
 not at all from the normal 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.210
 standard more through as well as with the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.530
 through the neck and everything is exactly 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.780
 the same just a little bit nicer 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.480
 So of course the question of taste but 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.140
 Roger just does not have enough signature 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.430
 guitars that's why there are now the 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.890
 jb 15 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.809
 that's a bit back to back 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.700
 basics we can still use the old model 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.189
 and she has the screw neck again 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.890
 but completely rosy meter so both 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.270
 the land as well as the neck that is one 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.639
 a little bit of modern rust 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.009
 maple likes to sound easy too 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.899
 Superman rusty maple and looks beautiful 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.189
 from if I mean that he hatch since then 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.539
 three again increased but 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.850
 that the host is sometimes quite for you 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:29.770
 funky and also a rusting maple blanket 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 however, the mahogany body is that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.350
 that is really pretty chic 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.880
 a bit dusty but you can see quite well 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.020
 they have done really great that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.799
 the guys can do really well 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.420
 you say yes 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.829
 otherwise never change necessarily 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.249
 see the same spex as the standard 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.810
 gp always had this too relative 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.579
 easy without guitar 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.600
 because it is easy because there is the 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.459
 world of tea even in one 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.100
 I'll bring another variant 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.420
 again from the 35 the zsc and indeed the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.709
 lot saw series 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.130
 this is yours next to you 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.569
 unsellable it can be so from the front 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.329
 Is it industry wise know 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.240
 but that has from mahagonny too 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.130
 marco botti and for that so maroni 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.840
 ball it really is extremely easy to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 normal mettenbrink just 3 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.819
 1 kilo I believe that maybe one 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 slightly lighter than heavier when you are 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.970
 lifts without guitar really unbelievable 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.489
 is enough synonymous, the same features of 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.290
 continuous neck and the gold hardware 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.510
 who is on it, of course, but so that 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.519
 15 debus presented in the last game 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.099
 very effective tool as I think and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.090
 the illuminated one gave it the unbelievable 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.180
 output but here you can see again 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.099
 that what you lasered this carbon look 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.790
 carbon look speed of light look yes 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.459
 exactly 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.010
 the story with his bmw wants don pedro 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.870
 Sincerely bought in the bmw and wanted 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.950
 that's why sports car is like that locally 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.079
 a guitar and in the middle of the night 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.370
 asked call the ball how are you from 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.629
 To build a guitar like this is to me 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.470
 but not so carbonneau 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.660
 made of carbon 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.849
 okay if you have two years eternity 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.200
 trades and there are 40 to 50 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.110
 prototypes of this guitar 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 who is guilty bmw bmw already on everyone 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.269
 case 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.319
 That's the kind of series there is 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.829
 different I come already meanwhile 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.660
 in five different colors and costs 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.130
 even in good euro but is really a 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.600
 absolute battleship the guitar 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.549
 So I myself have the standard metal 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.930
 is the quite cool but not imho 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.160
 a little more systems of course 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.959
 always just hear questions 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.700
 then our good old friend has the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.130
 airports also builders in the rest 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.239
 meanwhile a beard bearer her work 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.239
 just would not have a child anymore 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.910
 we have reserved the family 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.730
 maybe a few years have already existed 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.470
 once a stock was unfortunately something here 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.730
 do you say what income nri surf means 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.900
 chosen so special wood storage pad 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.579
 I believe to be 25 years old 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.049
 company anniversary , I only have to 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.209
 a read back then was also here 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.010
 twelfth bund such an inlay or too 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.889
 on board servers and limite on it 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.090
 which is of wood basically that's 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.060
 a little something new that has too 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.880
 each quilts maple blanket how to look 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.980
 Again, this beautiful inserted and 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.069
 of course a hosted mac absolutely maple 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.260
 and yes, they did not do anything 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.730
 This design is very good on the now 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.960
 Names presented there are if I'm in four 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.140
 different colors or 3 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.010
 I would have to read again exactly 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.000
 Of course , the special feature is that you can do that 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.730
 wood looks a bit through and this one 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.190
 I find this maple blanket quite whole 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.020
 Frankish and there is another one 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:34.750
 Of course, he had medium hamburger 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:39.040
 equipment and the color in francs 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.010
 took blueberry burst lukas otherwise 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.590
 otherwise the same spex was also like 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.750
 also already with the with the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.190
 user because here with the 15 db fine if it 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.870
 I really do not know 15 bethel 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.770
 myself the guitar user constantly 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:05:00.850
 By the way, an animal tool is rusting 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:02.560
 major and at the same time must be quite cool 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.060
 and is not quite as thin as this one 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.860
 all fritze finger guitar I have 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.190
 a little more wood to the euro 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.510
 if a man with beard pickups year 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.470
 are not the limitless plays now 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.150
 there are no longer any longer 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.220
 or live once in a while 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
 but that is the 9th 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.710
 it has been between look and that 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.440
 is quite normal or caste 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.030
 and pick ups from the maggio super parts 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.470
 and the color is also chic then 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.650
 that is also a limited change of 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.790
 the reception blue are similar but 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.680
 they did not do this beautiful blanket 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.810
 That's why it is also two euros more expensive 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.220
 the guitar in any case also great 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.080
 part 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.430
 and that something is done so no 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.780
 possible new achievements, however 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.330
 already a few new features and specs 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.260
 the fans just cool find it all goes well 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.260
 to be there, it's about it 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.660
 Signs if you like that 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.690
 there you can also like 40 times 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.950
 prototypes can also be built in 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.290
 water sector still something new 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.840
 then you can even go briefly over like 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:01.450
 something prepared to the right and to 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.040
 my left stingray as we see her 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.020
 Immediately depends also directly here wrong 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.610
 around for the first time with so painted 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.820
 bracket ordinary go through and 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.930
 neck that is a feature what where many 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.220
 people have been waiting 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.830
 I think in any case interesting and 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.690
 You really have to say adapt to the hand 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.940
 Takes immediately at the moment where you are 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.780
 somehow always around puts here completely 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.150
 different game feeling 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.140
 that's kinda I never say change 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.390
 a winning team but that's on everyone 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.410
 fall around sleep soundwise times have to 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.360
 Watch if you like it or not 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.130
 but many people have been looking for it for years 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570
 waiting has apparently refused 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.600
 but now it happened 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.560
 Through neck at the stingray you can 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 you also have another legend more 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.440
 retune 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.570
 that was it at first 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.320
 Updates on the hugh jackman page 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.320
 and that should be so much of the bad
