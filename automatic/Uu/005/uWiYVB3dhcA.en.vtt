what<00:02:47.150> soil<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.660> doing<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.490> land<00:02:49.760> issue<00:02:50.060> but

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
what soil is doing is the land issue but

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.050 
what soil is doing is the land issue but
this<00:02:50.990> is<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.350> drain<00:02:51.860> issue<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:53.090> also<00:02:53.330> in
