showers<00:02:34.739> are<00:02:34.920> moving<00:02:35.340> around<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:35.790> bit

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
showers are moving around a little bit

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
showers are moving around a little bit
it<00:02:36.420> has<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.600> load<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> loads<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.830> frame<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it has a load up it loads one frame at a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.190 
it has a load up it loads one frame at a
time<00:02:44.150> now<00:02:45.150> we're<00:02:45.299> going<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> zoom<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
time now we're going to zoom in so you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.509 
time now we're going to zoom in so you
can<00:02:46.380> actually<00:02:46.470> see<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.920> movie<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
can actually see the movie because this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.949 
can actually see the movie because this
looks<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.030> storm<00:02:48.330> systems<00:02:48.780> been

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
looks like this storm systems been

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:57.000 
looks like this storm systems been
pretty<00:02:49.440> slow<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.450> here<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.540> are

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.059 

you<00:02:57.939> can<00:02:58.090> see<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.269> moving<00:02:58.620> okay<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.890> that's

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
you can see it moving okay so that's

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.910 
you can see it moving okay so that's
that<00:03:02.939> video<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:05.019> can<00:03:05.140> get<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.379> local<00:03:05.769> video

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
that video you can get your local video

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.089 
that video you can get your local video
from<00:03:06.489> your<00:03:06.730> local<00:03:07.000> weather<00:03:07.299> people<00:03:08.099> while

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
from your local weather people while

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.319 
from your local weather people while
your<00:03:09.280> severe<00:03:09.730> weather<00:03:09.760> information<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.810> more

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
your severe weather information and more

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.210 
your severe weather information and more
so<00:03:13.329> let's<00:03:13.959> exit<00:03:14.349> out<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:16.980> let's<00:03:17.980> go<00:03:18.069> into

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so let's exit out of this let's go into

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.869 
so let's exit out of this let's go into
the<00:03:18.340> other<00:03:18.519> application<00:03:19.299> weather<00:03:19.629> bug<00:03:20.879> now

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
the other application weather bug now

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.899 
the other application weather bug now
what<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> did<00:03:22.510> notice<00:03:22.720> was<00:03:23.079> whether<00:03:23.319> bug

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
what I did notice was whether bug

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.550 
what I did notice was whether bug
usually<00:03:24.909> seems<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.450> update<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> little<00:03:26.439> bit

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
usually seems to update a little bit

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.710 
usually seems to update a little bit
quicker<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:27.099> temperatures<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.239> their<00:03:28.390> radar

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
quicker on temperatures but their radar

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.860 
quicker on temperatures but their radar
is<00:03:28.810> definitely<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.290> lot<00:03:29.500> less<00:03:29.829> advanced<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.810> you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
is definitely a lot less advanced so you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.539 
is definitely a lot less advanced so you
get<00:03:32.049> this<00:03:32.170> basic<00:03:32.590> same<00:03:32.769> information<00:03:33.129> just<00:03:33.430> in

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
a white thing and a little bit different

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.930 
a white thing and a little bit different

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
let's go to the maps now as you'll see

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.569 
let's go to the maps now as you'll see
maps<00:04:10.150> are<00:04:10.329> definitely<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:10.810> lot<00:04:11.109> less<00:04:11.470> advanced

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.990 

here<00:04:15.579> we<00:04:15.730> are

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.210 

now<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:20.600> can<00:04:20.810> play<00:04:21.140> these

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.730 

okay<00:04:30.180> we<00:04:30.390> can<00:04:30.510> see<00:04:30.660> them<00:04:30.750> moving<00:04:30.840> now<00:04:31.560> if<00:04:31.650> you

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
okay we can see them moving now if you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.350 
okay we can see them moving now if you
notice<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.160> didn't<00:04:32.400> get<00:04:32.490> an<00:04:32.610> option<00:04:32.910> for<00:04:33.090> past

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
notice we didn't get an option for past

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.030 
notice we didn't get an option for past
or<00:04:33.600> future<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:34.110> don't<00:04:34.260> get<00:04:34.410> feature<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.890> this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
or future we don't get feature on this

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.920 
or future we don't get feature on this
radar<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.400> just<00:04:35.550> get<00:04:35.640> past<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.720> not

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
quite as accurate but it's still radar

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.870 
quite as accurate but it's still radar
now<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.060> also<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:42.900> one<00:04:43.650> choices<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.370> two<00:04:44.610> and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
now you also get one choices of two and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.150 
now you also get one choices of two and
with<00:04:45.810> what's<00:04:46.050> nice<00:04:46.260> about<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.860> also
