00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello i am daniels springwald i 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.390
 would like to show you today how to get the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 arugula / glasses with the kinect 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 combine and thus without keyboard 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.240
 and mouse in a virtual room 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 can move 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.650
 with the kinect sdk you can get one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 normal xbox kinect sensor to the pc 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.080
 connect and from own program 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 to address out 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 The sensor provides for each body part 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 a coordinate connects the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 virtual camera with the by the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.579
 kinect measured position of the head 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.579
 you can move the camera in the room 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.250
 the motion sensor of the oculus rift 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 glasses recognizes only the rotation of the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.750
 head not but the position within 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 of the room at the same time the kinect for 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 the position and the oculus rift glasses 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.629
 to use for the rotation of the head 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.430
 complements itself very well 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.290
 That's the way things can be done on several pages 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.290
 or look up close 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.369
 with some additional hardware 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.799
 development, it is also possible the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.000
 own hand to interact with the 3d 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.000
 scene to use 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.420
 You can do this with a glove in the future 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.020
 equip with strain gages 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.850
 or 4 an almost 20 years old nylon 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 Gloves with built-in glass fibers 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.490
 use 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 by the curvature of the finger changes 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.630
 their translucency 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.340
 that in turn measure infrared diodes in 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.350
 cooperation with an arduino of the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.360
 data via usb s.der pc sends as at 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.250
 the eco of rift glasses is needed for 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.259
 the rotation of the hand is also a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.209
 Rotation system to the oculus rift 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.950
 glasses the kinect and the glove 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.500
 Together you can be in virtual 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.920
 move space while taking his own hand 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.319
 see 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.030
 as a result, manipulation in space is also possible 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.039
 for completely inexperienced users through 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.399
 Simply grab or move with the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.680
 hand possible has you also ideas for 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.049
 own virtual reality projects brought 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.970
 Do you have any suggestions or feedback? 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:20.040
 my demo then let me know 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.040
