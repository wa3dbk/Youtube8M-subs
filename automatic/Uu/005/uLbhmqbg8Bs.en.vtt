00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
just like prototypes right here but it's

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.200 
just like prototypes right here but it's
my<00:00:16.199> best<00:00:16.440> um<00:00:17.060> like<00:00:18.949> but<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.550> made<00:00:20.850> three

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
my best um like but like I made three

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.859 
my best um like but like I made three
different<00:00:22.789> three<00:00:23.789> different<00:00:23.910> slingshots<00:00:24.630> as

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
different three different slingshots as

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.009 
different three different slingshots as
prototype<00:00:25.500> slingshots<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.670> use<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.840> gonna

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
prototype slingshots to use I was gonna

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.009 
prototype slingshots to use I was gonna
go<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> smallest<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> decided<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
go the smallest one then I decided I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.010 
go the smallest one then I decided I
could<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.840> best

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
could use this one because it's the best

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.150 
could use this one because it's the best
I<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.380> hit<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.739> any<00:00:35.570> distance<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.780> height

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
I could hit from any distance or height

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.060 
I could hit from any distance or height
and<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:39.450> made<00:00:39.719> Angry<00:00:40.320> Birds<00:00:40.590> original<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> pigs

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070

maybe<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.650> brown<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.489> nothing<00:03:04.879> use<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> carton

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
maybe a brown of nothing use a carton

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.170 
maybe a brown of nothing use a carton
but<00:03:06.470> maybe<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.830> brown<00:03:07.220> because<00:03:07.610> there'd<00:03:07.940> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
but maybe a brown because there'd be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.890 
but maybe a brown because there'd be
more<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.870> slingshot<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.659> thought

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
more like the slingshot but you thought

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.210 
more like the slingshot but you thought
you<00:03:11.959> make<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.319> here<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.790> stack<00:03:14.890> three<00:03:15.890> of

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
you make them here you stack three of
