00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
going to be one inch cut I'm going to

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.599 
going to be one inch cut I'm going to
marry<00:01:42.229> my<00:01:42.409> mushrooms<00:01:42.799> in<00:01:44.859> and<00:01:45.859> a<00:01:45.950> nice<00:01:46.130> tip<00:01:46.369> to

marry my mushrooms in and a nice tip to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.190 
marry my mushrooms in and a nice tip to
start<00:01:46.820> breaking<00:01:47.240> down<00:01:47.270> these<00:01:47.509> vegetables<00:01:48.020> add

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
start breaking down these vegetables add

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.209 
start breaking down these vegetables add
a<00:01:48.229> little<00:01:48.499> bit<00:01:48.679> of<00:01:48.710> salt

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
a little bit of salt

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.069 
a little bit of salt
salts<00:01:49.999> going<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.240> pull<00:01:50.479> out<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.899> moisture

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
salts going to pull out the moisture

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.719 
salts going to pull out the moisture
from<00:01:51.499> a<00:01:51.590> lot<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.799> these<00:01:51.979> vegetables<00:01:52.249> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
from a lot of these vegetables and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.539 
from a lot of these vegetables and
actually<00:01:53.420> speed<00:01:53.749> up<00:01:53.899> your<00:01:54.020> cooking<00:01:54.380> time<00:01:54.590> on

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
actually speed up your cooking time on

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.219 
actually speed up your cooking time on
top<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.999> that<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:56.390> going<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.570> help<00:01:56.719> season

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
top of that it's going to help season

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.989 
top of that it's going to help season
your<00:01:57.350> food<00:01:57.560> quite<00:01:57.829> well<00:01:58.009> mushrooms<00:01:58.819> have<00:01:58.969> a

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
your food quite well mushrooms have a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.940 
your food quite well mushrooms have a
lot<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.329> moisture<00:01:59.659> in<00:01:59.929> them<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.350> what<00:02:00.530> happens

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
lot of moisture in them so what happens

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620 
lot of moisture in them so what happens
is<00:02:01.159> they<00:02:01.399> actually<00:02:01.850> bleed<00:02:02.210> out<00:02:02.420> their

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
is they actually bleed out their

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.989 
is they actually bleed out their
moisture<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.289> then<00:02:03.770> when<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.340> moisture<00:02:04.939> is

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
moisture and then when that moisture is

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.550 
moisture and then when that moisture is
in<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.179> pan<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.569> can<00:02:05.689> season<00:02:06.079> it<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.409> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
in the pan you can season it and the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.499 
in the pan you can season it and the
moisture<00:02:06.829> gets<00:02:07.009> reabsorbed<00:02:07.219> back<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.090> you

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
moisture gets reabsorbed back in you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.609 
moisture gets reabsorbed back in you

so<00:02:33.890> let's<00:02:34.099> build<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> little<00:02:34.730> bit

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
so let's build this a little bit

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.819 
so let's build this a little bit
casseroles<00:02:36.049> are<00:02:36.140> known<00:02:36.290> as<00:02:36.379> being<00:02:36.560> really

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
casseroles are known as being really

casseroles are known as being really
creamy<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.459> usually<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> problem<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
creamy and usually the problem with that

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.240 
creamy and usually the problem with that
is<00:02:38.810> you're<00:02:38.959> using<00:02:39.170> some<00:02:39.470> type<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.709> prepared

is<00:02:43.099> pretty<00:02:43.370> high<00:02:43.640> up<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:43.849> in<00:02:44.120> terms<00:02:44.239> of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
is pretty high up there in terms of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.089 
is pretty high up there in terms of
cholesterol<00:02:44.659> in<00:02:44.959> salt<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.470> using<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.829> fat-free

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
cholesterol in salt I'm using a fat-free

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.099 
cholesterol in salt I'm using a fat-free
version<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.819> time<00:02:46.879> so<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.629> is<00:02:47.689> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.989> be

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
version this time so this is going to be

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.289 
version this time so this is going to be
kind<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.470> thicker<00:02:48.739> soup<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.519> I'm<00:02:50.180> going

kind of the thicker soup and I'm going

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.640 
kind of the thicker soup and I'm going
to<00:02:50.329> back<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:50.959> with<00:02:50.989> actually<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> little

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to back that up with actually a little

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.250
