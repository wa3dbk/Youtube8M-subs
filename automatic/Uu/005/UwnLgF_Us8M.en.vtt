00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.750
 how easy it is and your family cooking with 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.460
 cheese creams clive today I'm going to 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.960
 prepare a pepper kit with broccoli 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.580
 write down the recipe because 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.820
 ingredients are very easy for the 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.149
 mass we have ice water flour pepper 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.860
 butter salt and eggs and for the 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.380
 stuffing we have peppers you can know 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.079
 any color creamy broccoli 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 eggs and of course the inevitable 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 cream cheese philadelphia 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.450
 we already have the mass we extend it in a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 refractory mold previously floured 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 and the butter to start doing the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.570
 filling we have to beat the whites to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 snow point 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.540
 once the keys are already beaten 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.650
 we reserve them and in another bowl we go to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.059
 Mix the cream cheese with the cream 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.320
 milk and we also add the yolks 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.090
 because we have separated them from the clear 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 and we are going to mix by approximately 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.350
 about 2 minutes now what we do is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 mix the egg whites until stiff with 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 the rest in the preparation gently 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.210
 this takes time and once we see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 that was well mixed we added the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.509
 broccoli previously boiled and the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.509
 Peppers 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.060
 let's incorporate a little salt 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 and pepper to taste 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.719
 we keep mixing gently 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.530
 and fill our mass with all the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.240
 ingredients that are ready we have 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 a preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.350
 centigrade or 350 of the NGO where we go 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.350
 to take our preparation 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.270
 and we already have the quiche ready and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.340
 He advised that they wait for someone who is warm to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.000
 able to cut it so that the mass does not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.000
 break let's put together a portion 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.520
 and ready with philadelphia you can puff up 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520
