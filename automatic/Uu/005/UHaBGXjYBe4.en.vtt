00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:18.410
 this is a video below that is from 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.410
 another one from last year of July 16 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:48.850
 now protects them young has resisted 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.850
 all winter in this area 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.550
 which is during the winter 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.550
 dies totally 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 and now 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 we give you the boats are tender though 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.759
 they have thorns and then with water to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.759
 can eat it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 this plant has thorns I suppose 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 suffer from s 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.720
 Well these are the tender stems 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 tender shoots 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:39.990
 and it's already showing if it recovers as 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:42.920
 You can see the cut a few days ago 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.920
 and the new router 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:59.300
 prudential that they have not gone 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.300
 and they are previously cut 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.970
 well, he gets in water 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.540
 in a covered place 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:26.340
 which are called mud bags with a 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:26.340
 way to 7 definitive with 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.610
 with water 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.890
 it's a very simple thing 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.890
 but it is very rich 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.980
 Well, they have seen how they are caught 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.599
 the calluses 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.599
 and look around 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.620
 and that's why every year clock 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.620
 and as no one passes or have been preserved 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.620
 the dry branches of passion 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.009
 fruits the one below 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.409
 and they start to generate new plant 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.409
 offers you some information 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:47.770
 you know that the flower comes out and then 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.580
 in the fruit that escaped him from where 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.580
 the seeds come out 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.650
 and they eat these things 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650
 the stems 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.750
 the chapinas 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.010
 and the mayor stops 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.010
 they are cured of it
