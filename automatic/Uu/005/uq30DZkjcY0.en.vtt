so<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.769> our<00:03:14.860> school<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.549> don't

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
so in our school we don't

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.089 
so in our school we don't
make<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.879> children<00:03:17.300> feel<00:03:17.569> guilty<00:03:18.140> about<00:03:18.319> how

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
make the children feel guilty about how

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.039 
make the children feel guilty about how
the<00:03:19.159> world<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.150> try<00:03:20.450> always<00:03:20.690> and

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
the world is that we try always and

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.380 
the world is that we try always and
encouraged<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:22.010> do<00:03:22.190> something<00:03:22.670> about<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:22.970> so

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
encouraged to do something about it so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.119 
encouraged to do something about it so
little<00:03:23.900> things<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.349> children<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:24.980> do

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
little things that children we can do

little things that children we can do
they<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.340> pick<00:03:25.760> up<00:03:25.940> trash<00:03:26.239> wherever<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.140> teach

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
they can pick up trash wherever I teach

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.259 
they can pick up trash wherever I teach
games<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.069> we'll<00:03:28.159> pick<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.580> trash<00:03:28.909> and<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
games and we'll pick up trash and the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.210 
games and we'll pick up trash and the
children<00:03:29.629> love<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.989> we<00:03:30.170> make<00:03:30.349> a<00:03:30.379> big<00:03:30.680> pile<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
children love it we make a big pile and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220 
children love it we make a big pile and
we<00:03:31.370> carry<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:31.909> trash<00:03:32.269> can<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.810> then

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
we carry it to the trash can and then

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.839 
we carry it to the trash can and then
they<00:03:33.349> feel<00:03:33.590> better<00:03:33.830> about<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.160> instead<00:03:34.790> of

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
they feel better about it instead of

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.330 
they feel better about it instead of
making<00:03:35.629> them<00:03:35.750> feel<00:03:36.049> bad<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.590> more<00:03:36.920> important

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
making them feel bad it's more important

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.940 
making them feel bad it's more important
to<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:38.480> do<00:03:38.660> something<00:03:39.140> about<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.769> teach

to to do something about it and to teach
them<00:03:40.250> back<00:03:40.430> maybe<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.060> miss<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.950> really

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
them back maybe I miss they really

them back maybe I miss they really
started<00:03:43.670> cleaning<00:03:43.879> into<00:03:44.299> finding<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.989> was<00:03:45.110> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
started cleaning into finding it was a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.800 
started cleaning into finding it was a
big<00:03:45.650> treasure<00:03:45.860> hunt<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.700> figure<00:03:47.329> out<00:03:47.450> what<00:03:47.659> was

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
big treasure hunt to figure out what was

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.110 
big treasure hunt to figure out what was
plant<00:03:48.680> life<00:03:48.890> versus<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:49.519> was<00:03:49.640> pieces<00:03:50.000> of

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
plant life versus what was pieces of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.819 
plant life versus what was pieces of
paper<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.540> plastic<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.230> noticing<00:03:51.709> that

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
paper and plastic and noticing that

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.250 
paper and plastic and noticing that
there<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.160> difference<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.690> children<00:03:54.140> are

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
there is a difference the children are

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.460 
there is a difference the children are
very<00:03:54.410> aware<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:55.359> areas<00:03:56.359> of<00:03:56.510> Cleveland<00:03:57.049> areas

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
very aware of areas of Cleveland areas

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.800 
very aware of areas of Cleveland areas
that<00:03:57.769> have<00:03:57.980> been<00:03:58.220> polluted<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.030> they<00:03:59.540> care

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that have been polluted and they care

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.530 
that have been polluted and they care
about<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.250> school<00:04:01.579> really

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
about that and so the school really

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.289 
about that and so the school really
wanted<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.530> be<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> part<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.129> the<00:04:04.340> cleanup<00:04:04.849> in

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
wanted to be a part of the cleanup in

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.780 
wanted to be a part of the cleanup in
order<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.930> demonstrate<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.400> caring

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
order to demonstrate that that caring

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.630 
order to demonstrate that that caring
goes<00:04:07.940> beyond<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:08.810> our<00:04:09.470> use<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
goes beyond just our use and the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.360 
goes beyond just our use and the
children<00:04:11.299> were<00:04:12.200> excited<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.829> be<00:04:12.950> part<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.310> that

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
children were excited to be part of that

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.949 
children were excited to be part of that
as<00:04:13.640> well<00:04:13.670> because<00:04:14.120> they<00:04:14.239> know<00:04:14.390> they<00:04:14.420> belong<00:04:14.930> to

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
as well because they know they belong to

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.170 
as well because they know they belong to
the<00:04:15.200> environment<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.890> there

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the environment in there

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.210

that by bringing children outside by by

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.880 
that by bringing children outside by by
showing<00:05:40.930> them<00:05:41.110> how<00:05:41.320> things<00:05:41.650> are<00:05:41.860> connected

I'm<00:05:42.550> finding<00:05:43.090> treasure<00:05:43.480> I<00:05:43.900> think<00:05:44.290> it<00:05:44.380> would

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
I'm finding treasure I think it would

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.550 
I'm finding treasure I think it would
make<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.770> huge<00:05:45.160> difference<00:05:46.020> if<00:05:47.020> beginning

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
make a huge difference if beginning

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.580 
make a huge difference if beginning
today<00:05:48.030> all<00:05:49.030> schools<00:05:49.590> were<00:05:50.590> to<00:05:50.860> only<00:05:51.730> use

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
today all schools were to only use

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.070 
today all schools were to only use
reusable<00:05:53.590> containers<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.970> do<00:05:55.540> composting

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
reusable containers and do composting

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.850 
reusable containers and do composting
and<00:05:56.950> care<00:05:57.580> for<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:57.910> environment<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.930> think<00:05:59.650> we

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
and care for the environment I think we

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.130 
and care for the environment I think we
would<00:06:00.070> notice<00:06:00.550> an<00:06:00.850> immediate<00:06:01.270> change<00:06:01.510> in

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
would notice an immediate change in

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.370 
would notice an immediate change in
beauty<00:06:02.920> all<00:06:03.370> around<00:06:03.430> us<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.480> I<00:06:05.020> think<00:06:05.050> we

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
beauty all around us and I think we

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.840 
beauty all around us and I think we
would<00:06:05.500> know<00:06:05.680> this<00:06:05.860> an<00:06:06.040> immediate<00:06:06.430> change<00:06:06.460> in

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
would know this an immediate change in

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.360 
would know this an immediate change in
health<00:06:07.120> we<00:06:07.720> would<00:06:07.960> know<00:06:08.170> this<00:06:08.380> an<00:06:08.710> eventual

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
health we would know this an eventual

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.360 
health we would know this an eventual
change<00:06:09.730> also<00:06:10.150> in<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.780> slowing<00:06:11.290> of<00:06:11.410> climate

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
change also in the slowing of climate

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.190 
change also in the slowing of climate
change<00:06:12.400> what<00:06:13.210> they<00:06:13.360> learn<00:06:13.570> now<00:06:13.810> in<00:06:14.020> their

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
change what they learn now in their

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.130 
change what they learn now in their
little<00:06:14.350> when<00:06:14.650> they're<00:06:14.830> 1<00:06:15.190> 2<00:06:15.430> 3<00:06:15.690> 10<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.960> mean

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
little when they're 1 2 3 10 I mean

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.630 
little when they're 1 2 3 10 I mean
those<00:06:17.290> are<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.470> things<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:17.800> they<00:06:17.890> take<00:06:18.070> into

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
those are the things that they take into

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.730 
those are the things that they take into
their<00:06:18.790> adulthood<00:06:19.270> it's<00:06:19.660> so<00:06:20.020> much<00:06:20.170> easier<00:06:20.380> if

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
their adulthood it's so much easier if

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.110 
their adulthood it's so much easier if
we<00:06:20.800> can<00:06:21.010> teach<00:06:21.190> them<00:06:21.220> from<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.670> beginning<00:06:22.030> and

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
we can teach them from the beginning and

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.730 
we can teach them from the beginning and
if<00:06:22.240> all<00:06:22.450> the<00:06:22.630> schools<00:06:22.900> were<00:06:23.110> teaching<00:06:23.440> all<00:06:23.620> the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
if all the schools were teaching all the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.070 
if all the schools were teaching all the
children<00:06:24.100> to<00:06:24.640> do<00:06:24.760> these<00:06:24.940> things<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:25.630> know<00:06:25.840> the

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
children to do these things you know the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.050 
children to do these things you know the
impact<00:06:26.350> would<00:06:26.530> be<00:06:26.590> huge<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:30.220> we<00:06:30.370> may<00:06:30.550> be<00:06:30.610> just

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
impact would be huge so we may be just

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.200 
impact would be huge so we may be just
one<00:06:31.630> small<00:06:31.960> piece<00:06:32.740> of<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:33.010> pie<00:06:33.280> our<00:06:33.670> little

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
one small piece of the pie our little

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.450 
one small piece of the pie our little
school<00:06:34.510> but<00:06:35.490> imagine

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
school but imagine

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.480 
school but imagine
if<00:06:37.550> other<00:06:38.060> schools<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:39.139> other<00:06:39.770> communities

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
if other schools and other communities

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.749 
if other schools and other communities
were<00:06:40.910> instilling<00:06:41.720> these<00:06:41.990> values<00:06:42.470> from<00:06:43.430> such<00:06:43.729> a

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
were instilling these values from such a

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.900 
were instilling these values from such a
young<00:06:43.880> age<00:06:44.330> I<00:06:44.810> think<00:06:45.229> that<00:06:45.470> it<00:06:46.009> becomes<00:06:46.460> a<00:06:46.669> part

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
young age I think that it becomes a part

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.170 
young age I think that it becomes a part
of<00:06:47.620> the<00:06:48.620> fabric<00:06:48.860> of<00:06:49.160> who<00:06:49.340> we<00:06:49.490> are<00:06:49.520> and<00:06:50.060> the

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
of the fabric of who we are and the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.510 
of the fabric of who we are and the
consciousness<00:06:50.840> is<00:06:51.050> something<00:06:51.500> that<00:06:52.160> just

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
consciousness is something that just

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.559 
consciousness is something that just
exists<00:06:53.300> in<00:06:53.419> us<00:06:53.660> and<00:06:54.050> we<00:06:54.110> don't

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
exists in us and we don't

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.869 
exists in us and we don't
need<00:06:55.689> so<00:06:56.199> much<00:06:56.379> of<00:06:56.589> the<00:06:56.679> education<00:06:57.309> as<00:06:57.550> we<00:06:57.729> get

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
need so much of the education as we get

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.639 
need so much of the education as we get
older<00:06:57.909> because<00:06:58.389> it<00:06:58.749> was<00:06:58.869> something<00:06:59.289> that<00:06:59.319> was

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649 
older because it was something that was

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:02.339 
older because it was something that was
taught<00:07:00.339> at<00:07:00.520> such<00:07:00.669> a<00:07:00.789> young<00:07:00.819> age<00:07:00.999> and<00:07:01.929> it's<00:07:02.199> so

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
taught at such a young age and it's so

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.320 
taught at such a young age and it's so
simple<00:07:02.649> some<00:07:03.490> of<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.699> things<00:07:03.909> that<00:07:04.089> we<00:07:04.179> can

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
simple some of the things that we can

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.659 
simple some of the things that we can
all<00:07:04.449> do<00:07:04.689> then<00:07:05.069> we<00:07:06.069> wouldn't<00:07:06.249> have<00:07:06.429> to<00:07:06.550> have

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
all do then we wouldn't have to have

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.459 
all do then we wouldn't have to have
beach<00:07:07.149> cleanup<00:07:07.659> dates<00:07:07.869> like<00:07:08.139> we're<00:07:08.319> doing

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
beach cleanup dates like we're doing

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:24.689 
beach cleanup dates like we're doing
