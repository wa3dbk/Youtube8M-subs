that<00:00:57.840> ball<00:00:58.129> like<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that ball like we know we can and like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
that ball like we know we can and like
we<00:00:59.969> haven't<00:01:00.180> trained<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> week<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.129> really

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
we haven't trained in a week but really

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
we haven't trained in a week but really
sloppy<00:01:02.309> way<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.329> mean<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.780> lucky
