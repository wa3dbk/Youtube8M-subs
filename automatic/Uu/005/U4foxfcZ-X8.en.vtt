00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
when I got this cube I was like man this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.460 
when I got this cube I was like man this
thing<00:02:33.850> locks<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.300> it's<00:02:34.570> way<00:02:34.750> too<00:02:34.810> quick<00:02:35.290> it's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.380 
thing locks up it's way too quick it's
uncontrollable<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.580> doesn't<00:02:36.910> corner<00:02:37.120> cut<00:02:37.300> as

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
uncontrollable it doesn't corner cut as

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.760 
uncontrollable it doesn't corner cut as
well<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> other<00:02:38.050> ones<00:02:38.290> at<00:02:38.500> least<00:02:38.530> mine

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
well as the other ones at least mine

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.410

doesn't<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> was<00:02:39.790> very<00:02:39.880> disappointed<00:02:40.060> but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
doesn't so I was very disappointed but

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.330 
doesn't so I was very disappointed but
honestly<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.990> more<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.470> saw<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.070> more

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
honestly the more I saw this the more

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.010 
honestly the more I saw this the more
I'm<00:02:42.640> beginning<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> may<00:02:43.960> be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
I'm beginning to like it and that may be

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.410 
I'm beginning to like it and that may be
because<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.440> used<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.860> diode<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.400> much<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.850> my

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
because I used the diode so much that my

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.840 
because I used the diode so much that my
2x2<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.710> got<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.040> know<00:02:48.160> formed<00:02:48.520> around

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
2x2 kind of got you know formed around

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.940 
2x2 kind of got you know formed around
that<00:02:49.120> cube<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:50.050> at<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> same<00:02:50.410> time<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.710> really

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
that cube but at the same time I really

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.410 
that cube but at the same time I really
don't<00:02:51.070> feel<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> link<00:02:51.640> PO<00:02:51.790> lives<00:02:52.180> up<00:02:52.360> to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
don't feel like the link PO lives up to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.210 
don't feel like the link PO lives up to
these<00:02:52.870> other<00:02:53.050> three<00:02:53.260> cubes<00:02:53.500> however<00:02:54.040> that's

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
these other three cubes however that's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.650 
these other three cubes however that's
just<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.520> opinion<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.210> may<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.540> do

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
just my opinion so it may have to do

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.620 
just my opinion so it may have to do
with<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.900> tensions<00:02:56.380> or<00:02:56.770> just<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.100> speak<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.630> in

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
with my tensions or just to speak you in

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.910 
with my tensions or just to speak you in
particular<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.440> know<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.740> lot<00:02:59.890> of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
particular because I know that a lot of

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.710 
particular because I know that a lot of
people<00:03:00.190> really<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.730> wing<00:03:00.880> PO<00:03:01.060> but<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.660> my

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
people really like the wing PO but in my

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.900 
people really like the wing PO but in my
opinion<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.140> don't<00:03:02.200> think<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
opinion I don't think that this is the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.850 
opinion I don't think that this is the
best<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.300> market<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> think<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.770> know

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
best of the market so I think you know

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.050 
best of the market so I think you know
that's<00:03:06.040> when<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.430> rule<00:03:06.580> out<00:03:06.640> right<00:03:06.850> away

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
that's when we can rule out right away

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's when we can rule out right away
but<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:08.260> love<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.590> fangshi<00:03:09.010> which

Jake will talk about all right so the
thankfully<00:03:11.350> that's<00:03:11.530> actually<00:03:11.920> my<00:03:12.160> main<00:03:12.400> and

as<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.690> see<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:14.260> bit<00:03:15.190> bigger<00:03:15.520> than

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
as you can see it's a bit bigger than

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.470 
as you can see it's a bit bigger than
the<00:03:15.970> other<00:03:16.090> ones<00:03:16.410> actually<00:03:17.610> 55<00:03:18.610> millimeter<00:03:18.970> so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
the other ones actually 55 millimeter so

aurora<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.690> almost<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.380> same<00:03:23.620> size<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.370> if

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
aurora it's almost the same size and if

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.250 
aurora it's almost the same size and if
you<00:03:25.120> have<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.300> mini<00:03:25.510> cube<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.810> actually<00:03:26.050> bigger

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
you have a mini cube is actually bigger

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.630 
you have a mini cube is actually bigger
so<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:27.310> know<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.640> pretty<00:03:27.700> big<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.720> has

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
so you know it's pretty big this has

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.100 
so you know it's pretty big this has
great<00:03:30.640> corner<00:03:31.000> cutting<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.480> know<00:03:31.510> as<00:03:31.780> always

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
great corner cutting you know as always

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.960 
great corner cutting you know as always
and<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:34.390> mean<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:35.500> does<00:03:35.920> not<00:03:36.100> lock<00:03:36.370> up<00:03:36.550> nearly<00:03:36.880> as

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and I mean it does not lock up nearly as

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.440 
and I mean it does not lock up nearly as
much<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.750> other<00:03:37.870> guys<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:39.040> love<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.209> thing

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
much as the other guys I love this thing

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.170 
much as the other guys I love this thing
it's<00:03:40.900> great<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:42.070> performs<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.670> algorithms

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
it's great it performs the algorithms

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.360 
it's great it performs the algorithms
incredibly<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:45.610> better<00:03:45.850> than<00:03:46.350> say<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.380> wit

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
incredibly much better than say the wit

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.290 
incredibly much better than say the wit
-<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.680> has<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> heavier<00:03:51.430> feel<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.970> so

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
- it's just has a heavier feel to it so

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.800 
- it's just has a heavier feel to it so
I<00:03:52.510> think<00:03:52.780> that's<00:03:53.110> what<00:03:53.290> allows<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.830> have

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
I think that's what allows it to have

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
I think that's what allows it to have
better<00:03:55.860> control<00:03:56.860> almost<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.810> yeah<00:03:59.200> I'd

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
better control almost to it so yeah I'd

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.040 
better control almost to it so yeah I'd
go<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.310> if<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.150> you're<00:04:01.690> like<00:04:01.840> me

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
go for that if you know you're like me

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.250 
go for that if you know you're like me
right<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.610> now<00:04:04.209> comes<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.510> question<00:04:04.570> what<00:04:05.110> is

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
right so now comes the question what is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.729 
right so now comes the question what is
the<00:04:05.650> best<00:04:05.980> 2x2<00:04:06.580> on<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.030> market<00:04:07.420> well<00:04:08.200> as<00:04:08.410> much

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
the best 2x2 on the market well as much

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.220 
the best 2x2 on the market well as much
as<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.040> like<00:04:09.370> more<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.570> as<00:04:10.660> much<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.989> like

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
as I like more you and as much as I like

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.080 
as I like more you and as much as I like
the<00:04:11.530> wit<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.800> v1<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.400> really<00:04:12.790> don't<00:04:12.940> feel<00:04:13.030> like

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
the wit to v1 I really don't feel like

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.610 
the wit to v1 I really don't feel like
these<00:04:13.300> are<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> two<00:04:13.660> best<00:04:13.840> now<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.410> what<00:04:14.500> -

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
these are the two best now that what -

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.310 
these are the two best now that what -
v1<00:04:14.890> has<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.070> lot<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.310> history<00:04:15.930> it's<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:17.049> really

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
v1 has a lot of history it's a really

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.170 
v1 has a lot of history it's a really
great<00:04:17.500> cube<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.070> at<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.340> same<00:04:18.489> time<00:04:18.730> dying

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
great cube but at the same time dying

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.820 
great cube but at the same time dying
and<00:04:19.570> think<00:04:19.840> she<00:04:19.989> have<00:04:20.109> knocked<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.500> out<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
and think she have knocked it out of the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.580 
and think she have knocked it out of the
park<00:04:21.190> where<00:04:21.820> there<00:04:22.030> are<00:04:22.150> two<00:04:22.300> by<00:04:22.450> tears<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:23.260> I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
park where there are two by tears so I

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.469 
park where there are two by tears so I
would<00:04:23.979> have<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.400> go<00:04:24.490> with<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.760> thank<00:04:24.970> she<00:04:25.150> even

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
would have to go with the thank she even

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.140 
would have to go with the thank she even
though

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
though

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.330 
though
my<00:04:26.300> Diane<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:26.900> really<00:04:27.259> great<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.949> even<00:04:28.190> though

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
my Diane is really great and even though

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.100 
my Diane is really great and even though
I<00:04:28.370> do<00:04:28.790> like<00:04:29.060> these<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.419> speak<00:04:29.630> use<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:29.990> think

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
I do like these to speak use I think

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.280 
I do like these to speak use I think
she's<00:04:30.470> just<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.919> good<00:04:31.449> now<00:04:32.449> just<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.259> know

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
she's just so good now just so you know

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.600 
she's just so good now just so you know
if<00:04:33.530> you're<00:04:33.680> gonna<00:04:33.830> get<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.040> 50<00:04:34.430> millimeter

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
if you're gonna get a 50 millimeter

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.480 
if you're gonna get a 50 millimeter
version<00:04:34.940> they<00:04:35.270> only<00:04:35.479> come<00:04:35.810> with<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.229> tile<00:04:36.530> as<00:04:37.070> of

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
version they only come with a tile as of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.370 
version they only come with a tile as of
now<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:37.880> if<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.090> don't<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.330> tiles<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.289> know

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
now so if you don't like tiles you know

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
now so if you don't like tiles you know
that's<00:04:39.590> really<00:04:39.919> not<00:04:40.070> recommendable<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.789> I
