Howard<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.550> let's<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.630> pull<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
Howard so let's see if we can pull this

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840 
Howard so let's see if we can pull this
off<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.650> guess<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> matter<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> how

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
off I guess it's just a matter of how

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940 
off I guess it's just a matter of how
many<00:00:33.180> times<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> pull<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> off

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
many times will it take to pull it off

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
many times will it take to pull it off
since<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.850> four<00:00:36.120> second<00:00:36.570> deal

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
since this is just a four second deal

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
since this is just a four second deal
you<00:00:37.380> either<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.250> don't<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.879> let's

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you either make it or you don't so let's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.450 
you either make it or you don't so let's
see<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.500> done<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.070> attempt
