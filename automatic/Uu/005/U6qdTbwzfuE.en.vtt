00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
little diversion even if it really is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.969 
little diversion even if it really is

a whole lot to dislike about this game
although<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.700> controls<00:01:58.149> don't<00:01:58.420> seem<00:01:58.960> that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
although the controls don't seem that

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.590 
although the controls don't seem that
responsive<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.310> lot<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> time<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.179> guess

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
responsive a lot of the time I guess

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.169 
responsive a lot of the time I guess
that's<00:02:01.780> really<00:02:02.170> my<00:02:02.319> only<00:02:02.350> big<00:02:03.100> problem<00:02:03.970> with

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179

the game in a side note it just seems so

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.090 
the game in a side note it just seems so
terribly<00:02:07.659> random<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.380> put<00:02:08.590> all<00:02:08.799> of<00:02:08.860> these

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
terribly random to put all of these

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.340 
terribly random to put all of these
characters<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.729> an<00:02:10.030> olympic<00:02:10.509> themed<00:02:10.869> video
