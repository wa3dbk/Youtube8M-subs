plays out two times too many moves on to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.330 
plays out two times too many moves on to
the<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.000> know<00:01:17.119> something<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.050> predictable<00:01:18.950> but

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the you know something I predictable but

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:29.850 
the you know something I predictable but

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.649 

so<00:01:30.860> he<00:01:30.950> plays<00:01:31.250> I'm<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.909> minor<00:01:32.420> g<00:01:33.200> e<00:01:33.530> minor<00:01:34.369> G<00:01:35.119> B

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
so he plays I'm a minor g e minor G B

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.190 
so he plays I'm a minor g e minor G B
minor<00:01:35.990> D<00:01:36.619> G<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.600> now<00:01:38.810> actually<00:01:39.799> stops<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.640> d

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
minor D G and now actually stops on d

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.990 
minor D G and now actually stops on d
but<00:01:42.200> he<00:01:42.470> goes<00:01:42.649> into<00:01:42.860> playing<00:01:43.159> G<00:01:43.490> because

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.800 

many<00:01:59.680> goes<00:01:59.890> on<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> second<00:02:00.700> verse<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.630> it's

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
many goes on to the second verse so it's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.170 
many goes on to the second verse so it's
the<00:02:01.900> same<00:02:02.080> thing<00:02:02.110> played<00:02:02.560> again<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.180> then

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
the same thing played again and then

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.260 
the same thing played again and then
there's<00:02:04.780> sort<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.080> like<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.530> solo<00:02:06.250> bit<00:02:06.550> it's
