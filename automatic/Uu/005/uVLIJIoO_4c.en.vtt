00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.150
 you want to see swirls in a glass of 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.439
 whiskey today we're going to do science in 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.939
 the bar here on very television in this 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.529
 experiment what we are going to use is 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.960
 part of the equipment of a bartender a 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.990
 dark liquor a glass of whiskey and cream 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.449
 liquid the first thing we do is boil 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.330
 a centimeter of liquor then 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.989
 Carefully helping us with a spoon 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.170
 we serve the liquid cream and at the moment 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.800
 what we will observe looking at the glass is 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.989
 a strange movement of liquor over 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.600
 of water this strange movement that 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.399
 we discovered is the convection now 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.890
 we explain what we have just 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.410
 observe here at the bar is a movement 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.539
 of convection the same kind of phenomenon 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.860
 that we observe when we heat something and 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.050
 in the same way of heat transport 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.520
 we have in the sun as we can 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.630
 play quietly in our 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.190
 kitchen with a saucepan and oil we serve the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.869
 oil in the saucepan and wait for it to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
 hot and what happens is what everyone 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.399
 we know the lower part of the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.480
 oil and ascend while the part 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.030
 cool 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.400
 and that circuit of rise and fall due 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 to the temperature difference is a 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.450
 convective motion and here we 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.890
 in the bar we have achieved it without having 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.230
 that to heat nothing only 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 using two liquids of different 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.480
 Concentrate the liquor and the cream after 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.210
 of this intense physics class of the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.500
 convection let's explain a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 experiment in which you can win 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.720
 a few eurillos in a bar for that 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 you just need to ask the waiter two 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.250
 shot glasses water and bourbon what 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 you do is serve the water in one of the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.790
 shots and in the other you serve the bourbon 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.050
 that you bet if I am able to 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.380
 change the water for the bourbon 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.850
 using exclusively a dni what 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 do you is tapas the glass of water with the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.180
 dni what you put on 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.630
 and you open a little bit so they mix 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.310
 the two books and little by little 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 you'll see how bourbon is changed 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.640
 Water 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.210
 seeing how it is appearing for a 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.740
 war 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.330
 if you have trusted me and you have done it 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.460
 you will have won the bet and you 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.770
 you will ask why the question well 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.110
 simple is simply a difference 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.240
 of density the water is denser than the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.790
 burgos the water that is above that is 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.220
 dense low and goes to the shot of 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.960
 down the bourbon is less dense and goes up and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.630
 they go to the top shot now 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.180
 we have practically changed the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.660
 bourbon by the water we have essentially 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.360
 passed with the help of a water dni to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.940
 shot of bourbon and back up to 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 the bar you can do science because the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.210
 next week more experiments here is 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.210
 very television
