00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hey ho people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.710
 new tutorial 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 This time I want to show you how you are 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 So you can finish your mod 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.099
 can export and then later 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 can use or publish 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 can and send to your friends 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 no matter what you do with it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 let me just show you now 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 video the whole thing makes you start 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.810
 simply dierikon butt butt that's it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 what eclipse is actually all the time in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 So background makes you look in there 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.480
 the clips also plate moves around the whole 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 market to test 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.219
 then he comes and then starts the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.079
 client we have to do that now with the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 make minecraft order pack manually here 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.719
 first how come a point lead out and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.899
 then start small and that makes 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.480
 actually in the background it is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.510
 a little more practical and the ried of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.410
 Sharing is ready so the deer 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 compile so combine again so 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 compile again i dont know how 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.250
 I can say that better 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.020
 well, minecraft is always good 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.939
 that does not encrypt any point java 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.439
 files but from the class files and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.030
 we have to do that with ours too 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.030
 mother participate and that with 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 so here's how office kate the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.049
 we execute and then in the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 folder here usa just look like if and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.310
 then in minecraft folder will then 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 we have to put our class on it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 we wait a moment 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is the mod tutorial point 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.579
 class and you can also directly 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 use 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 Of course, the important thing is that we 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.280
 do not forget the textures like 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.360
 are here in our eclipse 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.880
 folder band am there we have the two 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.850
 we have to copy that and in that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.350
 insert report mainz here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.270
 if you have the whole but still before 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.030
 wants to test because of black screen and so 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.610
 that one with smart client radio bath then 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 is important there are often in black screen 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 because you forget the textures in here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.619
 to pack the folder 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.900
 here are the ones too 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.879
 the whole thing is going on now if you have one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.620
 new fashion does so with new textures 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.470
 then that is very important that the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.940
 textures come in here again 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.709
 so that minecraft compact the car 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.610
 recognizes because everyone is only 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.599
 eclipse live well in the reporter 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.520
 stopped 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.170
 These three classes could be in now 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.030
 pull the minecraft there and if you can 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.910
 then the moths or then would the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.500
 whole engine already work but there 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.849
 if we already have the model or 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.870
 we can also use the cool ones 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.750
 take variant and indeed one 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.430
 zip file to put the whole thing together 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.569
 when I join you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.290
 tutorial matching the names of our 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.050
 fashion here 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.050
 and then it belongs in the mods order 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.760
 original minecraft there is the modder 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.650
 and I've already got that 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 tested 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.430
 the whole thing is copied over here and if 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.360
 now we will start the game that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.220
 whole fold 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.080
 that's what I did now was also just times 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.040
 and then we'll see you in game right away 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.150
 again so now neither are in game and 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.680
 can now direct us that nuclear power 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.840
 yes I remember that well 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670
 that's another week or so 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 two ago I made the videos 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.960
 have the last but it worked 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.520
 we have it now considers the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.650
 means in the place works before 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.500
 you can take it out texture as well 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.980
 agrees again to try the block 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.420
 yes the club can also be wonderful then 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.480
 we're actually going through the torches now 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 this block actually substitutes for this one 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.560
 not so bad idea 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.880
 and light makes everything wonderful 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.950
 I hope you have on this little 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.540
 part of my tutorial how to get 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.760
 programmed own minecraft mods 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.960
 fallen and I hope we see each other 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.960
 next time free again
