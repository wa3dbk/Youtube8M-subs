ago<00:00:45.019> I<00:00:47.479> got<00:00:48.479> this<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.819> it's<00:00:50.819> AMD<00:00:51.569> base

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
ago I got this one because it's AMD base

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.439 
ago I got this one because it's AMD base
that's<00:00:52.139> not<00:00:52.319> an<00:00:52.440> Intel<00:00:52.799> chip<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:54.089> want<00:00:54.299> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that's not an Intel chip and I want to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.549 
that's not an Intel chip and I want to
see<00:00:54.659> just<00:00:55.109> what<00:00:55.499> we<00:00:55.620> could<00:00:55.799> do<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.069> it<00:00:56.359> I<00:00:57.559> did

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
see just what we could do with it I did

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.509 
see just what we could do with it I did
try<00:00:59.459> a<00:00:59.879> 6<00:01:00.629> core<00:01:00.989> venom<00:01:01.530> chip<00:01:01.799> because<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.339> said

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
try a 6 core venom chip because it said

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.060 
try a 6 core venom chip because it said
it<00:01:02.549> would<00:01:02.699> support<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.179> phantom<00:01:03.539> ship<00:01:03.569> but<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it would support a phantom ship but just

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.969 
it would support a phantom ship but just
quad<00:01:05.339> cores<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.690> just<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.200> laughs<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> hope<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
quad cores but just for laughs I hope I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.960 
quad cores but just for laughs I hope I
throw<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> 6<00:01:08.610> core<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:11.100> knew<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
throw a 6 core in there and it knew it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.710 
throw a 6 core in there and it knew it
was<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.240> AMD<00:01:12.510> processor<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.800> knew<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.040> had

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
was an AMD processor and it knew it had

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
was an AMD processor and it knew it had
l1<00:01:15.720> l2<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> l3<00:01:16.410> cache<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:18.230> it<00:01:19.230> didn't<00:01:19.680> know

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
l1 l2 and l3 cache but it didn't know

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.980 
l1 l2 and l3 cache but it didn't know
what<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> hell<00:01:20.310> processor<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.680> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
what the hell processor it was so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
what the hell processor it was so
probably<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> bios<00:01:25.410> limitation<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
probably a bios limitation on this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.610 
probably a bios limitation on this
machine<00:01:27.620> it<00:01:28.620> does<00:01:29.010> have<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> 785<00:01:30.380> chipset<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
machine it does have the 785 chipset I

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.110 
machine it does have the 785 chipset I
believe<00:01:32.280> 785<00:01:32.910> G<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.480> I'm<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.780> mistaken<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> I'm

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
believe 785 G if I'm not mistaken so I'm

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.930 
believe 785 G if I'm not mistaken so I'm
thinking<00:01:36.540> maybe<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.530> might<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.400> bio<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
thinking maybe the might be a bio this

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.680 
thinking maybe the might be a bio this

RAM<00:02:44.590> or<00:02:44.890> anything<00:02:45.099> like<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.730> here

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
RAM or anything like that in here

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.550 
RAM or anything like that in here
so<00:02:46.569> basically<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:49.330> know<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.870> quick<00:02:50.260> pan

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
so basically you know just a quick pan

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.640 
so basically you know just a quick pan
of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.430> system<00:02:51.880> looks<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.959> inside<00:02:53.110> of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
of the system looks like the inside of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.069 
of the system looks like the inside of

weirdest thing real real special machine
this<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.300> why<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.690> want<00:04:26.080> at<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.289> 580<00:04:26.770> because

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
this is why I want at the 580 because

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.550 
this is why I want at the 580 because
it's<00:04:27.340> AMD<00:04:27.849> based<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.390> got<00:04:28.539> your<00:04:28.810> extra<00:04:29.050> PCI

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
it's AMD based you got your extra PCI

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.160 
it's AMD based you got your extra PCI
Express<00:04:30.010> slot

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
Express slot

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.740 
Express slot
and<00:04:32.670> like<00:04:33.670> I<00:04:33.790> say<00:04:33.940> from<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.270> looks<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.630> things

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
and like I say from a looks of things

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.960 
and like I say from a looks of things
that<00:04:35.110> lower<00:04:35.380> one<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:35.710> down<00:04:36.040> far<00:04:36.430> enough<00:04:36.460> where

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
that lower one is down far enough where

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.550 
that lower one is down far enough where
we<00:04:37.090> might<00:04:37.240> actually<00:04:37.450> be<00:04:37.750> able<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.990> fit<00:04:38.290> a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
we might actually be able to fit a

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.620 
we might actually be able to fit a
halfway<00:04:39.130> decent<00:04:39.160> card<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:40.030> one<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.480> won't

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
halfway decent card in this one we won't

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.590 
halfway decent card in this one we won't
have<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.990> limitation<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.970> big

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
have the limitation of that of that big

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.500 
have the limitation of that of that big
black<00:04:44.590> plastic<00:04:44.980> piece<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.880> gets<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.330> way

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
black plastic piece that gets in the way

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.340 
black plastic piece that gets in the way
like<00:04:46.810> we<00:04:46.960> did<00:04:47.170> with<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:48.420> dimensions<00:04:49.420> machine

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
like we did with the dimensions machine

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.920 
like we did with the dimensions machine
and<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.890> other<00:04:51.520> Optiplex<00:04:52.120> machines<00:04:52.540> that

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
and the other Optiplex machines that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.090 
and the other Optiplex machines that
I've<00:04:53.050> worked<00:04:53.260> on<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:55.620> guess<00:04:56.620> that's<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.070> for

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
I've worked on so I guess that's it for

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.810 
I've worked on so I guess that's it for
this<00:04:57.370> one<00:04:57.640> it's<00:04:57.820> gonna<00:04:57.970> be<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.180> wrap<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.670> just

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
this one it's gonna be a wrap and I just

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.280
