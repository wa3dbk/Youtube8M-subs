that we will have to do less mining and
also<00:03:52.170> by<00:03:52.590> doing<00:03:53.250> less<00:03:53.460> mining<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
also by doing less mining the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.490 
also by doing less mining the
environment<00:03:55.140> will<00:03:56.070> benefits<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.330> key<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
environment will benefits the key is to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.320 
environment will benefits the key is to
move<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> closed-loop<00:03:59.610> pattern<00:04:00.209> of

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
move to a closed-loop pattern of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.750 
move to a closed-loop pattern of
materials<00:04:00.959> use<00:04:01.260> what<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.550> cell

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
materials use what you have with cell

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.370 
materials use what you have with cell
phones<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.240> with<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> lot<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.690> products<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.260> our

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
phones and with a lot of products in our

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.860 
phones and with a lot of products in our
society<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.459> we<00:04:05.760> extract<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.300> materials

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
society is that we extract the materials

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.480 
society is that we extract the materials
we<00:04:07.020> make<00:04:07.200> them<00:04:07.380> into<00:04:07.560> products<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.160> use<00:04:08.310> them

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
we make them into products we use them

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.490 
we make them into products we use them
for<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.670> very<00:04:08.820> short<00:04:09.180> period<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.660> time<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.170> then

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
for a very short period of time and then

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.040 
for a very short period of time and then
we<00:04:10.560> throw<00:04:10.770> them<00:04:10.890> away<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.940> we<00:04:12.090> use<00:04:12.300> them<00:04:12.600> longer

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
we throw them away if we use them longer

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.500 
we throw them away if we use them longer
if<00:04:13.260> we<00:04:13.410> take<00:04:13.590> them<00:04:13.800> back<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.340> recycle<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.209> we

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
if we take them back and recycle them we

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.729 
if we take them back and recycle them we
are<00:04:15.600> moving<00:04:15.750> through<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.109> clothes<00:04:16.440> with

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
are moving through the clothes with

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.250 
are moving through the clothes with
pattern<00:04:17.459> survey<00:04:18.269> show<00:04:18.480> people<00:04:18.840> want<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.169> do

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
pattern survey show people want to do

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.080 
pattern survey show people want to do
the<00:04:19.380> right<00:04:19.560> thing<00:04:19.829> yeah<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:20.640> if<00:04:20.820> people

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
the right thing yeah I think if people

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.000 
the right thing yeah I think if people
knew<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.590> they<00:04:22.740> would<00:04:22.919> definitely

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
knew what it do so they would definitely

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.460 
knew what it do so they would definitely
recycle<00:04:23.730> certainly<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.990> doesn't<00:04:25.290> cost

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
recycle certainly if it doesn't cost

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.409 
recycle certainly if it doesn't cost
them<00:04:25.680> more<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.100> it's<00:04:26.610> relatively<00:04:27.000> convenient

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
them more and it's relatively convenient

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.820 
them more and it's relatively convenient
I<00:04:27.720> think<00:04:27.990> you'll<00:04:28.110> find<00:04:28.260> people<00:04:28.500> being<00:04:28.770> very

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
I think you'll find people being very

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.240 
I think you'll find people being very
cool<00:04:29.130> off<00:04:29.220> we<00:04:30.210> would<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.890> know<00:04:31.890> someone's

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
cool off we would like to know someone's

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.200 
cool off we would like to know someone's
opinion<00:04:32.490> how<00:04:32.790> yeah

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
opinion how yeah

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:49.530 
opinion how yeah
