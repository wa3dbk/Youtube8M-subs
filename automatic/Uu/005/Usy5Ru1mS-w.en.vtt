00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the idea I believe and now we're gonna

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
the idea I believe and now we're gonna
try<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
try and put in a little bit of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
try and put in a little bit of
progression<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.869> interesting<00:01:31.350> things<00:01:31.590> into

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
progression more interesting things into

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.840 
progression more interesting things into
it<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.189> simple<00:01:32.939> stuff

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.190 

so<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.939> get<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.210> idea<00:01:44.539> you<00:01:44.689> can<00:01:44.780> go<00:01:44.930> up<00:01:45.079> you

the track like I said is the same but

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900 
the track like I said is the same but
there's<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.980> kinds<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.310> elements<00:02:22.730> coming

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
there's all kinds of elements coming

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.289 
there's all kinds of elements coming
into<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.890> add<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.220> top<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.120> make

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
into it that add on top of it and make

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.729 
into it that add on top of it and make
it<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.510> little<00:02:26.660> bit<00:02:26.840> more<00:02:27.019> interesting<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
it a little bit more interesting as you

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:40.810 
it a little bit more interesting as you
go<00:02:27.860> along<00:02:28.160> these<00:02:28.370> levels<00:02:39.400> alright<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.579> it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
go along these levels alright and it

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.849 
go along these levels alright and it
feels<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.450> good<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.230> succeed<00:02:42.650> it

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
feels really good when you succeed it

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.039 
feels really good when you succeed it
requires<00:02:43.220> such<00:02:44.000> an<00:02:44.150> insane<00:02:44.420> amount<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.780> focus

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
requires such an insane amount of focus

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.599 
requires such an insane amount of focus
and<00:02:45.410> again<00:02:45.799> these<00:02:45.920> are<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> story

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
and again these are just the story

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.860 
and again these are just the story
levels<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.150> we're<00:02:47.299> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> get<00:02:47.570> through<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
levels so we're going to get through the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:59.289 
levels so we're going to get through the
last<00:02:47.989> one<00:02:48.400> hopefully<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:57.410> right<00:02:57.850> when<00:02:58.850> next<00:02:59.030> I

press we're gonna go through the actual

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.430 
press we're gonna go through the actual
game<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:02.120> gonna<00:03:02.299> try<00:03:02.600> my<00:03:02.810> best<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.230> not<00:03:03.260> gonna

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
game I'm gonna try my best I'm not gonna

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.080 
game I'm gonna try my best I'm not gonna
talk<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.680> lot<00:03:03.920> because<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:04.400> difficult<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
talk a lot because it's difficult and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.750 
talk a lot because it's difficult and
you<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.540> focus<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.709> about<00:03:06.950> twice<00:03:07.459> or

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
you have to focus it's about twice or

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.849 
you have to focus it's about twice or
three<00:03:08.239> times<00:03:08.269> or<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:08.900> faster<00:03:09.319> than<00:03:09.739> what

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
three times or it's faster than what

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.520 
three times or it's faster than what
we've<00:03:10.010> seen<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.400> far<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.880> very<00:03:11.389> long<00:03:12.170> I'm

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
we've seen so far it's very long I'm

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.470 
we've seen so far it's very long I'm
gonna<00:03:12.680> try<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.250> get<00:03:13.370> through<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.609> exactly<00:03:14.269> one

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
gonna try and get through it exactly one

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.210 
gonna try and get through it exactly one
time<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.959> will<00:03:15.139> probably<00:03:15.650> screw<00:03:15.859> it<00:03:15.950> up<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.160> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
time I will probably screw it up in the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.490 
time I will probably screw it up in the
middle<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.579> did<00:03:16.790> finish<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.180> before<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:18.350> it's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
middle I did finish it before but it's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.020 
middle I did finish it before but it's
difficult<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.160> I'll<00:03:19.250> probably<00:03:19.459> screw<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.910> up

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
difficult so I'll probably screw it up

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.750 
difficult so I'll probably screw it up
try<00:03:20.450> my<00:03:20.600> best<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.680> let's<00:03:21.889> just<00:03:22.130> let's<00:03:22.579> just

them<00:03:28.579> down<00:03:28.850> arrow<00:03:29.090> key<00:03:29.299> because<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
them down arrow key because it's the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.379 
them down arrow key because it's the
most<00:03:29.750> comfortable<00:03:30.139> one<00:03:30.260> for<00:03:30.440> me<00:03:31.239> let's<00:03:32.239> do

one more one last thing it's actually

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.110 
one more one last thing it's actually
0.8<00:05:19.229> speed<00:05:19.650> so<00:05:20.159> when<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.400> finish<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.880> level

0.8 speed so when you finish this level
it<00:05:21.510> goes<00:05:21.750> up<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.990> 0.9<00:05:22.710> which<00:05:23.310> completely

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
it goes up to 0.9 which completely

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.969 
it goes up to 0.9 which completely
messes<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.389> your<00:05:24.539> timing<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.139> in<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.830> way

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
messes with your timing and in that way

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.879 
messes with your timing and in that way
kind<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.340> creates<00:05:26.550> artificial<00:05:26.880> difficulty

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
kind of creates artificial difficulty

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.990 
kind of creates artificial difficulty
