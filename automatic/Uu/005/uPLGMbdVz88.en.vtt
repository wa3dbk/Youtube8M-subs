on<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.850> drinking<00:02:32.180> water<00:02:32.330> plant<00:02:33.070> learn<00:02:34.070> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
on the drinking water plant learn the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.410 
on the drinking water plant learn the
water<00:02:34.520> enters<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.150> water<00:02:35.510> tower<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.420> also

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
water enters the water tower and also

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.100 
water enters the water tower and also
where<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> water<00:02:39.050> exits<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.920> water<00:02:40.130> tower

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
where the water exits the water tower

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.230 
where the water exits the water tower
and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.370> wastewater<00:02:44.000> treatment

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
and then on the wastewater treatment

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.030 
and then on the wastewater treatment
area<00:02:44.750> you're<00:02:44.990> going<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> put<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.770> both

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
area you're going to put it on both

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.550 
area you're going to put it on both
sides<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.790> chlorine<00:02:47.150> basin<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.350> clay<00:02:54.350> can

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
sides of the chlorine basin and clay can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.280 
sides of the chlorine basin and clay can
work<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.190> well<00:02:55.520> but<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.060> adhesive<00:02:56.570> putty

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
work as well but the adhesive putty

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.290 
work as well but the adhesive putty
seems<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:58.070> more<00:02:58.250> reusable<00:02:58.550> than<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.120> way

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
seems to be more reusable than the way

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.480 
seems to be more reusable than the way
it<00:02:59.720> last<00:02:59.900> longer<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.620> you've<00:03:00.950> got<00:03:01.070> two<00:03:01.250> places

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
it last longer so you've got two places

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.790 
it last longer so you've got two places
on<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.970> wastewater<00:03:02.360> treatment<00:03:02.600> area<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.320> two

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
on the wastewater treatment area and two

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.460 
on the wastewater treatment area and two
places<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.460> drinking<00:03:04.850> water<00:03:05.480> area<00:03:05.960> also

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
places on the drinking water area also

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.100 
places on the drinking water area also
the<00:03:06.620> storm<00:03:07.010> drain<00:03:07.630> we're<00:03:08.630> gonna<00:03:08.720> put<00:03:08.990> one

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110

and then we're going to place your

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.330 
and then we're going to place your
wetland<00:04:11.080> that's<00:04:11.200> provider<00:04:11.620> with<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.950> model

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
wetland that's provider with the model

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.720 
wetland that's provider with the model
over<00:04:13.180> here<00:04:13.410> thanks<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.620> factory<00:04:15.069> area<00:04:15.280> but

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
over here thanks to the factory area but

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.659 
over here thanks to the factory area but
what<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.209> recommend<00:04:16.750> first<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> wetland<00:04:18.549> is

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
what we recommend first so wetland is

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.610 
what we recommend first so wetland is
usually<00:04:19.000> wet<00:04:19.180> right<00:04:19.480> yes<00:04:19.989> that's<00:04:20.290> right<00:04:20.560> so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
usually wet right yes that's right so

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.080 
usually wet right yes that's right so
wet<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.250> little<00:04:21.430> bit<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:22.180> helps<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.600> later

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
wet it a little bit it helps it later

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.300 
wet it a little bit it helps it later
place<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.270> right<00:04:25.419> there<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.229> next<00:04:29.410> thing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
place it right there and the next thing

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.340 
place it right there and the next thing
is<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.820> become<00:04:31.330> you've<00:04:31.720> been<00:04:31.960> given<00:04:32.260> a

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
is you become you've been given a
