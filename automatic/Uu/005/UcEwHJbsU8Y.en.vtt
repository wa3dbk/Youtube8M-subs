00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
 the sprint star is 3 0 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.419
 the latter was compared to what extent this year was strongest 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.009
 the 36 year old 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.650
 the fourth quarter 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 hr 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.439
 we had no choice 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.640
 according to digitimes 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.080
 because there is quite a topic promoted among members of the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.880
 interest rates 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 at that time also a loss of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 what we did and what we had in mind 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 the 24 year old woman died 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 the goalkeeper almost walked to AA Gent 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 9 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 about a minute 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 one million euros on one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 the hunger 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.080
 just a matter of time 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 they really want a lot of women 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.890
 I do not wish that the children were afraid 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.970
 I have the top ten the very police have started an investigation home 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 for inflation 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.359
 the year 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.439
 fire4it 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.439
 until it's not for nothing 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 stereo MCs 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.590
 tim kretschmer has to withdraw from afghanistan 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.480
 being recovered 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.210
 is to see that fight 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.520
 hahahaha 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.480
 That gives the citizen to return the musical again 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.000
 had greenpeace 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.939
 is a new initiative 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.170
 blame it 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.030
 tens 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.140
 the perpetrator is pessimistic 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 Sint Truiden 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.890
 the dealers 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 music critics steam 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.489
