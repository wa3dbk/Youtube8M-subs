I'm going to kick off a new series of
guitar<00:00:17.990> videos<00:00:19.149> essentially<00:00:20.149> I<00:00:20.390> guess<00:00:20.630> I<00:00:20.750> can

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
guitar videos essentially I guess I can

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.049 
guitar videos essentially I guess I can
call<00:00:21.169> them<00:00:21.320> guitar<00:00:21.800> questions<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.730> keep<00:00:22.880> it

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:23.059 
call them guitar questions to keep it

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.929 
call them guitar questions to keep it
very<00:00:23.329> generic<00:00:24.020> in<00:00:24.169> general<00:00:24.739> I<00:00:24.950> want<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:25.730> cover

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
very generic in general I want to cover

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.659 
very generic in general I want to cover
in<00:00:26.239> each<00:00:26.480> video<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:27.169> question<00:00:27.800> that<00:00:28.009> I<00:00:28.040> receive

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
in each video a question that I receive

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.870 
in each video a question that I receive
from<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.480> on<00:00:30.009> being<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.189> student<00:00:31.759> or

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
from you on being a student or

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.060 
from you on being a student or
subscriber<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.899> website<00:00:33.410> or<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.920> my

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
subscriber to the website or to my

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.400 
subscriber to the website or to my
youtube<00:00:34.520> channel<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.239> I<00:00:35.929> thought<00:00:36.109> it's<00:00:36.320> a

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
youtube channel and I thought it's a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.259 
youtube channel and I thought it's a
good<00:00:36.559> opportunity<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:37.280> just<00:00:37.519> get<00:00:38.030> these

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
good opportunity to just get these

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.270 
good opportunity to just get these
questions<00:00:38.600> answered<00:00:39.109> to<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.890> extent

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
questions answered to the extent

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.099 
questions answered to the extent
possible<00:00:40.339> there<00:00:41.210> are<00:00:41.300> some<00:00:41.480> questions<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.989> I

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
possible there are some questions that I

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.529 
possible there are some questions that I
simply<00:00:42.410> can't<00:00:42.829> answer<00:00:43.129> for<00:00:43.640> those<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.089> can

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
simply can't answer for those that I can

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.889 
simply can't answer for those that I can
answer<00:00:44.899> I<00:00:45.350> will<00:00:45.649> do<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:46.010> separate<00:00:46.609> video<00:00:46.999> so<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
answer I will do a separate video so the

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.590 
answer I will do a separate video so the
first<00:00:47.929> question<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:48.949> series<00:00:49.429> is<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:50.239> it

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
first question in this series is is it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.660 
first question in this series is is it
hard<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.350> learn<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.829> play<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.129> guitar<00:00:52.249> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
hard to learn to play the guitar and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.410 
hard to learn to play the guitar and
that's<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.839> seemingly<00:00:54.679> trivial<00:00:55.100> question<00:00:55.969> that

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
that's a seemingly trivial question that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.779 
that's a seemingly trivial question that
would<00:00:56.629> deserve<00:00:57.249> straightforward<00:00:58.249> answer<00:00:58.640> but

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
would deserve straightforward answer but

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.130 
would deserve straightforward answer but
it's<00:00:58.940> unfortunately<00:00:59.659> not<00:00:59.870> that

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
it's unfortunately not that

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.939 
it's unfortunately not that
straightforward

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
straightforward

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.219 
straightforward
because<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:01.909> all<00:01:02.120> have<00:01:02.420> different<00:01:02.929> standards

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
because we all have different standards

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.040 
because we all have different standards
when<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.949> comes<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.870> determined<00:01:05.870> what's

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
when it comes to a determined what's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.310 
when it comes to a determined what's
hard<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:06.920> hard<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.550> guess<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.630> underlying

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
hard and not hard I guess the underlying

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.470 
hard and not hard I guess the underlying
problem<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:11.210> um<00:01:11.650> with<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.910> presence

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
problem is that um with the the presence

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.920 
problem is that um with the the presence
of<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.080> internet<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.130> all<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.030> offers<00:01:17.900> that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
of the internet and all the offers that

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.670 
of the internet and all the offers that
you<00:01:18.440> see<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:19.310> kind<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.120> suggests<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.290> can

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
you see it kind of suggests that you can

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.160 
you see it kind of suggests that you can
learn<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.340> play<00:01:22.370> guitar<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.060> your<00:01:23.240> sleep<00:01:23.840> or

learn to play guitar in your sleep or
that's<00:01:25.130> probably<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.670> little<00:01:25.910> extreme<00:01:26.270> or<00:01:26.810> by

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
that's probably a little extreme or by

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.590 
that's probably a little extreme or by
putting<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.680> very<00:01:28.130> little<00:01:28.640> effort<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.450> there

like Hendrix in the you know two three
weeks<00:01:38.330> or<00:01:38.600> something<00:01:38.930> like<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.080> I'm<00:01:39.350> making

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680

weeks or something like that I'm making
this<00:01:39.800> up<00:01:40.010> but<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.700> probably<00:01:40.940> get<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.390> point

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
this up but you probably get the point

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.980 
this up but you probably get the point
on<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:42.800> goes<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> extent<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.540> found

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
on it goes to the extent that I found

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.980 
on it goes to the extent that I found
actually<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.950> an<00:01:46.940> offer<00:01:47.180> where<00:01:47.480> they<00:01:47.600> suggest

did a I did a spoof on that on on my

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.770 
did a I did a spoof on that on on my
website<00:01:54.080> um<00:01:54.320> trying<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.400> ridicule<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.570> whole

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
website um trying to ridicule the whole

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.990 
website um trying to ridicule the whole
notion<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.800> would<00:01:58.100> be<00:01:58.370> remotely

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
notion that it would be remotely

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.020 
notion that it would be remotely
possible<00:01:59.810> to<00:02:00.320> put<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:01.070> set<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.760> headphones

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
possible to put on a set of headphones

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.780 
possible to put on a set of headphones
go<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.780> sleep<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.800> essentially<00:02:04.340> do<00:02:04.640> that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
go to sleep and then essentially do that

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.970 
go to sleep and then essentially do that
for<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> couple<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.390> days<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.320> wake<00:02:06.560> up<00:02:06.590> and

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
for a couple of days and you wake up and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.700 
for a couple of days and you wake up and
then<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.310> can

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then you can

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
then you can
play<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.190> hard<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.060> nonsense

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
play it hard that's just nonsense

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.980 
play it hard that's just nonsense

really<00:02:22.620> not<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.100> complicated<00:02:23.550> anymore<00:02:24.240> you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
really not that complicated anymore you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.330 
really not that complicated anymore you
know<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.320> days<00:02:25.500> people<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.160> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
know back in the days people had to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880 
know back in the days people had to
practice<00:02:26.850> well<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.810> truth<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.500> still

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
practice well the truth is you still

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.800 
practice well the truth is you still
have<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.130> practice<00:02:29.459> there<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.450> no<00:02:30.780> other

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
have to practice there is just no other

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.880 
have to practice there is just no other
way<00:02:31.230> around

things<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.910> become<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.690> easier<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
things have become much easier with the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
things have become much easier with the
advent<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> internet<00:02:36.270> because<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.780> have

advent of the internet because you have

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.830 
advent of the internet because you have

all kinds of different things so that

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
has become much easier but nonetheless I

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.460 
has become much easier but nonetheless I
think<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:46.310> your<00:02:47.310> guitar<00:02:47.640> starter<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:48.630> think<00:02:49.110> if

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
think if your guitar starter or think if

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.400 
think if your guitar starter or think if
you're<00:02:49.709> thinking<00:02:50.280> about<00:02:50.570> starting<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:52.200> learn

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
you're thinking about starting to learn

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.080 
you're thinking about starting to learn
to<00:02:52.620> play<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> guitar<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.550> probably<00:02:54.060> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
to play the guitar it's probably a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.930 
to play the guitar it's probably a
little<00:02:54.420> bit<00:02:54.690> harder<00:02:55.140> than<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.470> would<00:02:55.500> think

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
little bit harder than you would think

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.000 
little bit harder than you would think
so<00:02:56.940> what<00:02:57.120> does<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:57.300> mean<00:02:57.720> harder<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.890> does

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so what does that mean harder what does

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.670 
so what does that mean harder what does
it<00:02:59.160> mean<00:02:59.459> putting<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> effort<00:03:00.390> well<00:03:01.350> it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
it mean putting in the effort well it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.340 
it mean putting in the effort well it
comes<00:03:02.220> down<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.610> practice<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.720> want<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
comes down to practice if you want to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.920 
comes down to practice if you want to
learn<00:03:04.530> something<00:03:05.010> new<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.180> includes<00:03:06.690> an

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
learn something new and that includes an

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.110 
learn something new and that includes an
instrument<00:03:07.650> such<00:03:07.890> as<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> guitar<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:09.090> have

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
instrument such as the guitar you have

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.410 
instrument such as the guitar you have
to<00:03:09.630> practice<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.500> order<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.340> master<00:03:12.030> that

to practice in order to master that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.600 
to practice in order to master that
skill<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.530> are<00:03:13.650> no<00:03:13.950> hard<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.489> fast

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
skill so there are no hard and fast

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
days piece of cake I can easily do that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.660 
days piece of cake I can easily do that
well<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.200> might<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.769> true<00:03:38.160> for<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.459> first

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
well that might be true for the first

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.400 
well that might be true for the first
couple<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.120> weeks<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.049> typically

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
couple of weeks but what typically

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.190 
couple of weeks but what typically
happens<00:03:40.670> once<00:03:41.670> things<00:03:42.209> get<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.690> little<00:03:42.959> bit

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
happens once things get a little bit

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.789 
happens once things get a little bit
more<00:03:44.299> challenging<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> interest

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
more challenging you know the interest

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.830 
more challenging you know the interest
drops<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.910> then<00:03:48.030> other<00:03:48.269> things<00:03:48.630> become

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
drops off and then other things become

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.949 
drops off and then other things become
more<00:03:49.200> important<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.549> very<00:03:50.959> important

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
more important so it's very important

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.670 
more important so it's very important
that<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.320> keep<00:03:52.769> keep<00:03:53.700> us<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.440> consistency<00:03:55.440> as

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that you keep keep us a consistency as

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.819 
that you keep keep us a consistency as
you<00:03:56.100> practice<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.940> don't<00:03:57.450> slag<00:03:57.840> off<00:03:58.140> so<00:03:58.769> to

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
you practice and don't slag off so to

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.580 
you practice and don't slag off so to
sum<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.269> hard<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.750> learn<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.140> play

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
sum up is it hard to learn to play

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.310 
sum up is it hard to learn to play
guitar<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:02.340> would<00:04:02.730> put<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.239> way<00:04:03.690> it's

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
guitar I would put it this way it's

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.960 
guitar I would put it this way it's
probably<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.860> little<00:04:05.100> bit<00:04:05.340> harder<00:04:05.670> than<00:04:05.790> you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
probably a little bit harder than you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.630 
probably a little bit harder than you
think<00:04:06.209> simply<00:04:06.720> because<00:04:07.160> there's<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.370> idea

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
think simply because there's this idea

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.330 
think simply because there's this idea
out<00:04:09.180> there<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.780> everything<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:11.070> much

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
out there that everything is much much

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.850 
out there that everything is much much
easier<00:04:11.700> these<00:04:12.090> days<00:04:12.150> which<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.200> true<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.620> some

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
easier these days which is true to some
