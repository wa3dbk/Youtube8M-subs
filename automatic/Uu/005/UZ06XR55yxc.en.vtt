00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.280 

I'm<00:02:00.660> also<00:02:00.930> redoing<00:02:01.590> Optimus<00:02:02.250> Prime<00:02:02.580> because

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290

I'm also redoing Optimus Prime because
the<00:02:04.290> first<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.860> did<00:02:05.010> was<00:02:05.370> with<00:02:05.580> my<00:02:05.790> shoddy

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
the first one I did was with my shoddy

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.130 
the first one I did was with my shoddy
camera<00:02:06.830> then<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.860> had<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.340> dub<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:11.340> legs

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
camera then I had to dub it so the legs

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.830 
camera then I had to dub it so the legs
separate<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:14.220> move<00:02:14.490> out<00:02:14.720> there's<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
separate and they move out there's a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.610 
separate and they move out there's a
joint<00:02:16.140> here

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
joint here

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.420 
joint here
which<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.480> how<00:02:18.720> there's<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.800> part<00:02:20.160> here

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
which you see how there's a part here

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.880 
which you see how there's a part here
that<00:02:20.460> sticks<00:02:20.910> out<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.810> leg<00:02:22.110> it's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that sticks out but on this leg it's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
that sticks out but on this leg it's
more<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.459> middle<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.870> push<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
more in the middle you have to push it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.710 
more in the middle you have to push it
out<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.600> back<00:02:29.209> comes<00:02:30.209> up<00:02:30.510> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
out like that then the back comes up to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
out like that then the back comes up to
go<00:02:30.930> behind<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> legs<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.680> they're<00:02:38.010> like

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
go behind the legs and they're like

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.840 
go behind the legs and they're like
always<00:02:39.230> half<00:02:40.230> robot<00:02:40.650> half<00:02:41.480> vehicle<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> bring

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
always half robot half vehicle so bring

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.930 
always half robot half vehicle so bring
the<00:02:45.150> window<00:02:45.600> shield<00:02:46.310> they're<00:02:47.310> supposed<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> be

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the window shield they're supposed to be

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.460 
the window shield they're supposed to be
to<00:02:48.150> bring<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> front<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:50.060> then<00:02:51.470> split

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to bring it to the front and then split

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.990 
to bring it to the front and then split
the<00:02:52.709> cab<00:02:52.980> into<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.670> this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
the cab into like that and you it this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
the cab into like that and you it this
is<00:02:57.209> kind<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.600> tricky<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.500> pull<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
is kind of tricky you have to pull it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.750 
is kind of tricky you have to pull it
out<00:02:59.989> forward<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.170> make<00:03:01.350> sure<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.160> pull<00:03:02.549> up

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
out forward and make sure and pull up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.060 
out forward and make sure and pull up
this<00:03:03.060> say<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.310> space<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.340> transform<00:03:08.510> so

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
this say I have space to transform so
