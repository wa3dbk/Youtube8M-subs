00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.009
 asq 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.480
 he says it went through your head at the time of these arrests 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.449
 summoned to the Mexican national team 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.449
 nothing for having a lot of joy said we have been going through 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.829
 p kenia gm said that this one had given him the list and that he who was the 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:21.679
 true 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.929
 I felt very happy 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.300
 it's been six months for you incredible you took ownership with 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.979
 chivas 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 and now rounds up a tournament with a call to the Mexican national team is the 

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.230
 result of the effort of a long career 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 it's a job already 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.120
 By the way six seven years ago being in the professional first division 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 that you are maturing you are growing as a non-soccer player 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.120
 i 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.590
 Well, all this, such oral work every day, I think that this is what I 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.610
 I have always focused on helping my team 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740
 is that the requirement is that we have 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.730
 in chivas because I think not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 I think that is what makes you grow chivas brings eight players of the selection 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.810
 mexican 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.439
 the team that gives them illes of the america only with three this means that 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.500
 chivas is effectively becoming the team of mexico 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.720
 Well, the truth is that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.000
 what 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.770
 the sun we have a good diego set 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.880
 they could be fairer 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.110
 I presented 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.180
 a pompous Mexican citizen for an operation that we are 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.630
 having I think that 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.079
 we have a good we are not well mentalized in the station and how 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.210
 Cuba, I think 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.510
 this to the quality enchanted position talking with those of the differences 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.039
 that you find among the chivas that won the championship the last bull 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.320
 the chivas delia babies 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 that stops being coasts 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060
 at this time 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
 I live the present 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 as the axis of the delivered to the maximum 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.100
 nitrate help my teammates on the side more than I can to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.540
 in what is in my hands to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.059
 to get the final results 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.199
 wear 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.609
 takes chivas to the top of the process 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.789
 as he writes according to performance that we have that great 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.699
 they will go this 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:20.820
 constans that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.069
 this regularity we have shown 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.349
 the block what we have left is good 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.739
 you have to turn yourself in every day 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.329
 each match and receive it to the fullest in order to continue growing and getting the 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:32.790
 objectives
