00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.810
 for the medical community the tissue that surrounds the cells did not have any 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.109
 importance for many years 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.499
 so it's really a filler material you may not have any 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:16.560
 function 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 let's see what can be found if we approach with the microscope 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429
 electronic 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.970
 naked eye 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.039
 the outer structure resembles a matrix 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.810
 we actually observe a network of sugar biopolymers I think that already 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260
 had a three-dimensional space 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 very prominent tacuary mind are intertwined 12 a varied network of farms 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.690
 structural elements such as collagen and elastin 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.970
 we continue a bit in these two structures 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.550
 the collagen 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 It is observed in the form of thicker fibers 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.990
 similar constitution yundulah will do without free ends of donations 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.250
 while elastin has caracas farms 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.640
 rectilinear 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 that branches in Chiapas years 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.309
 We also found a rich circulatory counterpart charged with exchange of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.410
 nutrients the transport of biomarkers 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 is the path of arrival of structural immunological components 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 near the blood vessels by matches by the matrix are the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.630
 liver cells 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 we went through ana martínez 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.299
 Fibroblasts appear with a large core composed of nuclei 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 Fixed key macrophages for local defense processes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.230
 irregularly 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.670
 with numerous extensions and paco hours 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 we come across conglomerates of fat cells in the way you expect 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.890
 bright of variable sizes 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.020
 we also observe an intricate network of terminal slab farms that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.420
 start otermín longing matrix 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 these structural rows 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.680
 so contact with the cell membrane 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.149
 it becomes evident that interconnection that the matrix this week 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.620
 as matrix cellular ribbon of the cytoskeleton 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.760
 that reaching the nucleus of the cell 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.960
 allows that information gave you that contact with the nuclear ribbon matrix and 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 impact on the atc in
