click i'm clicking on this so what we

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.700 
click i'm clicking on this so what we
have<00:00:39.979> is<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:41.000> collection<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:42.280> various<00:00:43.570> sized

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
have is a collection of various sized

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.609 
have is a collection of various sized
objects<00:00:45.710> that<00:00:46.489> are<00:00:46.729> grouped<00:00:47.269> together<00:00:47.750> so

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:48.619 
objects that are grouped together so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:50.799 
objects that are grouped together so
what<00:00:48.769> we<00:00:48.860> have<00:00:48.979> to<00:00:49.100> do<00:00:49.549> first<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.390> delete<00:00:50.750> some

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
what we have to do first to delete some

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.460 
what we have to do first to delete some
of<00:00:51.080> these<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.129> actually<00:00:52.280> ungroup<00:00:53.150> them

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
of these is to actually ungroup them

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.030 
of these is to actually ungroup them
best<00:00:54.470> way<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.920> that<00:00:54.949> right<00:00:55.960> click<00:00:56.960> go<00:00:57.260> right

best way to do that right click go right

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.969 
best way to do that right click go right
there<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.400> ungroup<00:00:58.879> click<00:00:59.570> on<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.960> what<00:01:00.830> that

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
there to ungroup click on it what that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.770 
there to ungroup click on it what that
does<00:01:01.189> is<00:01:01.220> breaks<00:01:01.729> them<00:01:01.909> all<00:01:02.030> up<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:02.239> now<00:01:02.540> when<00:01:02.689> I

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
does is breaks them all up so now when I

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.289 
does is breaks them all up so now when I
click<00:01:03.080> here<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:04.189> not<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.519> same<00:01:04.760> as<00:01:04.909> here

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
click here it's not the same as here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.750 
click here it's not the same as here
it's<00:01:05.630> not<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.990> same<00:01:06.229> as<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.310> know<00:01:07.430> so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
all those different pieces are broken up

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.840 
all those different pieces are broken up
now<00:01:11.210> you'll<00:01:11.420> notice<00:01:11.719> that<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:13.009> have<00:01:13.039> some

on my plasma cutter so what I do is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.190 
on my plasma cutter so what I do is
select<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:24.979> actually<00:01:25.390> translucent<00:01:26.390> it

these to get go on little one here and I
already<00:01:59.689> get<00:01:59.929> that<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.789> now<00:02:01.789> what<00:02:02.359> we<00:02:02.479> should

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
already get that one now what we should

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.309 
already get that one now what we should
have<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.389> object<00:02:05.389> start<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.959> finish

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
have is just one object start to finish

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.010 
have is just one object start to finish
and<00:02:06.350> this<00:02:06.679> is<00:02:06.889> exactly<00:02:07.360> what<00:02:08.360> our<00:02:08.390> plasma

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
and this is exactly what our plasma

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.290 
and this is exactly what our plasma
cutter<00:02:09.289> will<00:02:09.770> follow<00:02:10.130> around<00:02:10.340> will<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.150> these

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
cutter will follow around will do these

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780 
cutter will follow around will do these
interior<00:02:12.020> cuts<00:02:12.350> first<00:02:12.770> which<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.340> kind<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
interior cuts first which is kind of the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.300 
interior cuts first which is kind of the
protocol<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:15.170> we'll<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.530> ahead<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.890> do

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
protocol and then we'll go ahead and do

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
protocol and then we'll go ahead and do
the<00:02:16.460> exterior<00:02:16.910> all<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> way<00:02:17.420> around

so let's go in i currently have this set
to<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.129> make<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> black<00:02:29.819> object<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.780> here

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
to just make a black object down here

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.789 
to just make a black object down here
let's<00:02:32.129> take<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> square<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.379> draw<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.439> square

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
let's take a square and draw a square

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.050 
let's take a square and draw a square
right<00:02:35.189> over<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.579> top<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.200> now<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.400> know<00:02:38.609> if

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
right over the top of it now you know if

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.179 
right over the top of it now you know if
i<00:02:39.269> select<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.810> area<00:02:40.260> you'll<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.980> that

different stuff is there but this is
kind<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.709> back<00:02:43.889> to<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.189> illustrator<00:02:44.730> 101<00:02:45.329> if

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
kind of back to that illustrator 101 if

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.720 
kind of back to that illustrator 101 if
I<00:02:45.599> select<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.109> square<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.980> select<00:02:47.639> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
I select that square and select the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
I select that square and select the
other<00:02:47.939> object<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.109> a<00:02:49.139> well<00:02:49.379> bills

it's completely gone and removed so

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.390 
it's completely gone and removed so

let's do the other one this is the other
one<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.790> didn't<00:03:09.060> necessarily<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.659> so

let me draw a square over the top of it
you<00:03:12.900> could<00:03:13.230> make<00:03:13.439> a<00:03:13.469> circle<00:03:14.150> anything

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
you could make a circle anything

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.339 
you could make a circle anything
actually<00:03:16.639> go<00:03:17.639> back<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.030> our<00:03:18.239> main<00:03:18.569> selection

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
actually go back to our main selection

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.789 
actually go back to our main selection
tool<00:03:19.829> select<00:03:20.329> both<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.569> those<00:03:21.719> and<00:03:22.109> then<00:03:22.440> here

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
tool select both of those and then here

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.839 
tool select both of those and then here
we'll<00:03:23.010> weld<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.459> BAM<00:03:24.379> completely<00:03:25.379> gone<00:03:25.639> up<00:03:26.639> and

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
we'll weld it BAM completely gone up and

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.740 
we'll weld it BAM completely gone up and
left<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.859> what<00:03:28.859> we<00:03:28.979> have<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.209> vector

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
left so what we have this is a vector

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.020 
left so what we have this is a vector
image<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.790> we've<00:03:32.790> tried<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> distill<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.810> down

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
image and we've tried to distill it down

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.280 
image and we've tried to distill it down
into<00:03:36.030> something<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.540> we<00:03:36.629> can<00:03:36.810> cut<00:03:36.989> out<00:03:37.109> with

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
into something that we can cut out with

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.819 
into something that we can cut out with
our<00:03:37.319> plasma<00:03:37.889> cutter<00:03:38.449> well<00:03:39.449> we're<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.169> Adobe

we can save it as an image tiff whatever
this<00:04:28.080> is<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> one<00:04:28.529> I'm<00:04:28.650> after<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:29.099> dxf<00:04:30.029> file

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
this is the one I'm after this dxf file

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.480 
this is the one I'm after this dxf file
and<00:04:31.630> I'm<00:04:31.750> going<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.930> save<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.230> out<00:04:32.490> already

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
and I'm going to save it out already

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.120 
and I'm going to save it out already
just<00:04:33.760> did<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.180> actually<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:34.890> save<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:36.040> out

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
just did this actually but save it out

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.880 
just did this actually but save it out
as<00:04:36.190> blur<00:04:36.690> dxf<00:04:37.770> we'll<00:04:38.770> go<00:04:38.980> ahead<00:04:39.510> replace<00:04:40.510> it

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
as blur dxf we'll go ahead replace it

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.950 
as blur dxf we'll go ahead replace it
now<00:04:41.890> when<00:04:42.550> you're<00:04:42.700> exporting<00:04:43.360> there's<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
now when you're exporting there's a

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320 
now when you're exporting there's a
number<00:04:44.230> of<00:04:44.440> different<00:04:44.590> types<00:04:45.070> of<00:04:45.340> dxf<00:04:46.000> files

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
number of different types of dxf files

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.960 
number of different types of dxf files
that<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.810> can<00:04:46.960> pick<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.620> what<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.280> found<00:04:48.700> that

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
that you can pick and what I found that

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.630 
that you can pick and what I found that
works<00:04:49.270> for<00:04:49.600> me<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.080> go<00:04:50.440> back<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.070> oldest

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
works for me is to go back to the oldest

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.920 
works for me is to go back to the oldest
type<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.690> anyone<00:04:53.140> gives<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:55.690> one

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
type that anyone gives you and that one

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.520 
type that anyone gives you and that one
seems<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.680> be<00:04:56.860> more<00:04:57.600> recognizable<00:04:58.600> than<00:04:58.630> some

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
seems to be more recognizable than some

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.070 
seems to be more recognizable than some
of<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.740> newer<00:04:59.950> ones<00:05:00.480> again<00:05:01.480> depending<00:05:01.960> on

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of the newer ones again depending on

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.630 
of the newer ones again depending on
your<00:05:02.200> CAD<00:05:02.500> program<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.280> sort<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.580> thing

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
your CAD program and that sort of thing

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.140 
your CAD program and that sort of thing
but<00:05:04.000> think<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.110> reverse<00:05:05.850> compatibility<00:05:06.850> if

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
but think of reverse compatibility if

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150 
but think of reverse compatibility if
you<00:05:07.330> go<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.750> older<00:05:08.080> one<00:05:08.440> you're<00:05:08.980> better

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
you go with the older one you're better

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.820 
you go with the older one you're better
now<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:10.030> can<00:05:10.360> also<00:05:10.480> scale<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.200> at<00:05:11.320> this<00:05:11.500> point

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
now you can also scale it at this point

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.190 
now you can also scale it at this point
I<00:05:12.040> usually<00:05:12.370> skip<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.790> number<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:13.840> colors

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
I usually skip that number of colors

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.870 
I usually skip that number of colors
guess<00:05:14.590> what<00:05:14.830> we<00:05:15.040> don't<00:05:15.190> have<00:05:15.250> any<00:05:15.490> color<00:05:15.700> we

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
guess what we don't have any color we

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.120 
guess what we don't have any color we
have<00:05:15.970> black<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.210> white<00:05:16.480> and<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:17.470> can<00:05:17.710> do<00:05:18.100> a

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
have black and white and you can do a

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.510 
have black and white and you can do a
PNG<00:05:18.790> file<00:05:19.240> or<00:05:19.450> JPEG<00:05:20.020> if<00:05:20.560> you're<00:05:20.800> saving<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.400> out

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
PNG file or JPEG if you're saving it out

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.660 
PNG file or JPEG if you're saving it out
as<00:05:21.730> that<00:05:21.910> type<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:24.100> few<00:05:24.310> other<00:05:24.430> options

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
as that type and a few other options

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.090 
as that type and a few other options
here<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.360> really<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:26.080> main<00:05:26.320> one<00:05:26.590> right<00:05:26.950> up

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
here but really the main one right up

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.980 
here but really the main one right up
here<00:05:27.400> that's<00:05:27.880> where<00:05:28.120> we<00:05:28.270> want<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.570> save<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.780> out

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
here that's where we want to save it out

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.990 
here that's where we want to save it out
as<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.530> oldest<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.100> we<00:05:30.190> can<00:05:30.370> possibly<00:05:30.820> get

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
as the oldest that we can possibly get

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.040 
as the oldest that we can possibly get
click<00:05:31.870> OK<00:05:32.050> we<00:05:32.680> did<00:05:32.920> that<00:05:33.480> now<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.540> next<00:05:34.840> step

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
click OK we did that now the next step

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.890 
click OK we did that now the next step
is<00:05:35.680> we're<00:05:36.040> going<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.190> be<00:05:36.370> over<00:05:36.850> in<00:05:37.180> rhino<00:05:37.480> 3d

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
is we're going to be over in rhino 3d

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.230 
is we're going to be over in rhino 3d
and<00:05:38.200> we're<00:05:38.290> going<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.470> resize<00:05:38.980> this<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.850> kind

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
and we're going to resize this to kind

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.200 
and we're going to resize this to kind
of<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.510> cutting<00:05:41.080> size<00:05:41.320> that<00:05:41.590> we<00:05:41.710> want<00:05:41.920> to<00:05:42.010> do

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
of the cutting size that we want to do

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.060 
of the cutting size that we want to do
but<00:05:43.210> really<00:05:44.050> what<00:05:44.200> we<00:05:44.350> did<00:05:44.530> there<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:45.630> took

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
but really what we did there is took

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.700 
but really what we did there is took
raster<00:05:48.070> image<00:05:48.490> a<00:05:48.670> pixel<00:05:49.180> image<00:05:49.630> converted<00:05:50.560> it

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
raster image a pixel image converted it

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.490 
raster image a pixel image converted it
into<00:05:50.830> vector<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.760> then<00:05:52.360> did<00:05:52.570> some<00:05:52.600> cleanup<00:05:53.140> on

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
into vector and then did some cleanup on

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.120 
into vector and then did some cleanup on
it<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:54.580> next<00:05:55.210> stop<00:05:55.600> I'll<00:05:55.900> meet<00:05:56.290> you<00:05:56.350> over<00:05:56.560> and
