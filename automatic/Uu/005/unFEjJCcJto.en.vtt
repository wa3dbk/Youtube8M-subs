hi I'm Alice rosario from pingskills i
seem<00:00:03.600> has<00:00:03.780> asked<00:00:04.049> us<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> question<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.799> what

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
seem has asked us a question about what

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.519 
seem has asked us a question about what
to<00:00:05.549> do<00:00:05.819> with<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> ball<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.810> drops<00:00:07.080> down

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
to do with the ball that drops down

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.270 
to do with the ball that drops down
below<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> table<00:00:08.820> level<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.200> seem<00:00:10.469> ideally

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
below the table level so I seem ideally

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.339 
below the table level so I seem ideally
you<00:00:11.670> want<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> get<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> ball<00:00:12.420> earlier<00:00:13.049> when

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you want to get the ball earlier when

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.930 
you want to get the ball earlier when
the<00:00:13.469> ball<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.679> above<00:00:14.040> table<00:00:14.400> height<00:00:14.730> but

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the ball is above table height but

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.060 
the ball is above table height but
sometimes<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.630> get<00:00:15.870> caught<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.800> if

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
sometimes you do get caught out so if

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.160 
sometimes you do get caught out so if
you're<00:00:17.279> struggling<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.600> across<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
you're struggling to get across to the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
you're struggling to get across to the
ball<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.820> down<00:00:21.060> below

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
ball and you find that it's down below

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.929 
ball and you find that it's down below
the<00:00:21.779> table<00:00:22.170> level<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> need<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.670> is

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the table level what you need to do is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
the table level what you need to do is
obviously<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.689> can't<00:00:25.080> hit<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> ball<00:00:25.320> too

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
obviously you can't hit the ball too

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.140 
obviously you can't hit the ball too
flat<00:00:26.189> because<00:00:26.340> you're<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> go<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
flat because you're going to go into the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.359 
flat because you're going to go into the
end<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> table<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.560> need<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.279> able

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
end of the table so you need to be able

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.959 
end of the table so you need to be able
to<00:00:29.550> lift<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.179> ball<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.279> make<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to lift the ball up and make it on the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270 
to lift the ball up and make it on the
table<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.469> lifting<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.130> ball

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
table now when you're lifting the ball

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
table now when you're lifting the ball
up<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.360> couple<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.750> things<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> need

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
up there's a couple of things you need

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
up there's a couple of things you need
to<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.600> get

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to think about one is you need to get

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
to think about one is you need to get
the<00:00:39.899> ball<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.890> quite<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> spin<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the ball with quite a lot of spin to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.200 
the ball with quite a lot of spin to
brush<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> ball<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> down

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
brush the ball to get it up and down

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
brush the ball to get it up and down
quickly<00:00:45.210> over<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> net<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.379> second<00:00:46.739> thing<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
quickly over the net the second thing is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
quickly over the net the second thing is
to<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.360> placement<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to really think about your placement and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
to really think about your placement and
your<00:00:49.440> speed<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.730> can't<00:00:51.030> hit<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> ball<00:00:51.390> too

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
your speed you can't hit the ball too

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.100 
your speed you can't hit the ball too
fast<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
fast so now you need to think about the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
fast so now you need to think about the
pace<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> hit<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> ball

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pace that you're going to hit the ball

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270 
pace that you're going to hit the ball
out<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> also<00:00:57.780> need<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.710> focus<00:00:58.890> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
out you also need to really focus on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
out you also need to really focus on
where<00:00:59.640> you're<00:00:59.820> hitting<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> ball<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.719> from

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
where you're hitting the ball so from

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
where you're hitting the ball so from
here<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.739> can't<00:01:02.010> hit<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> ball<00:01:02.340> too<00:01:02.550> fast<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
here you can't hit the ball too fast you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
here you can't hit the ball too fast you
need<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> think<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.350> placement<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
need to think about your placement and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.289 
need to think about your placement and
your<00:01:05.670> speed<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.710> their<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:09.000> away

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
your speed so if their way back away

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.760 
your speed so if their way back away
from<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> table<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.110> might<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> think

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
from the table you might want to think

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
from the table you might want to think
about<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.250> getting<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> short<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> lower

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
about just getting it short and lower

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.929 
about just getting it short and lower
over<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> net<00:01:17.600> if<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.640> are

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
over the net if they are if they are

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
over the net if they are if they are
close<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> table<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.590> might<00:01:22.770> want

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
close to the table then you might want

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
close to the table then you might want
to<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.340> getting<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> ball<00:01:24.150> really

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to think about getting the ball really

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.609 
to think about getting the ball really
deep<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> close<00:01:25.500> into<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:30.320> similarly<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
deep and close into them similarly you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
deep and close into them similarly you
can<00:01:31.770> start<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:33.150> direction

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
can start to think about which direction

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
can start to think about which direction
you're<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> play<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.860> better<00:01:35.100> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you're going to play are they better on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
you're going to play are they better on
the<00:01:35.430> backhander<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.180> better<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the backhander they better on the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
the backhander they better on the
forehand<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.070> work<00:01:38.280> out

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
forehand and then you need to work out

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
forehand and then you need to work out
where<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> place<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> ball

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
where you're going to place the ball

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:53.340 
where you're going to place the ball
across<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> table<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.340> well

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.320 

so<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.380> seen<00:01:54.680> there's<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.190> few<00:01:55.400> ideas<00:01:55.610> for<00:01:56.210> what

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
so I seen there's a few ideas for what

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.240 
so I seen there's a few ideas for what
you<00:01:56.510> can<00:01:56.660> do<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.080> ball<00:01:57.380> have<00:01:57.860> dropped

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
you can do with that ball have dropped

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:09.430
