00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
sims could that happen let's talk about

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.840 
sims could that happen let's talk about
actually<00:02:05.950> implementing<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.070> into<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> game

actually implementing this into the game

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.149 
actually implementing this into the game
because<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.629> very<00:02:08.989> possible<00:02:09.409> because

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
because this is very possible because

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.339 
because this is very possible because
the<00:02:10.489> Sims<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:10.939> fictional<00:02:11.450> universe<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:12.170> can

the Sims is a fictional universe it can

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.870 
the Sims is a fictional universe it can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
take liberties and make things

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.030 
take liberties and make things
comically<00:02:14.690> easier<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.470> people<00:02:15.560> who<00:02:15.830> might

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
comically easier for people who might

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.860 
comically easier for people who might
otherwise<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.850> been<00:02:17.060> disadvantaged

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
otherwise have been disadvantaged

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.230 
otherwise have been disadvantaged
there's<00:02:18.350> no<00:02:18.530> racism<00:02:18.800> because<00:02:19.550> from<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.880> design

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
there's no racism because from a design

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.080 
there's no racism because from a design
standpoint<00:02:20.780> race<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.070> facial<00:02:22.670> features

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
standpoint race is just facial features

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.270 
standpoint race is just facial features
and<00:02:23.330> coloring<00:02:23.870> it'd<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.380> very<00:02:24.620> difficult<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
and coloring it'd be very difficult to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760 
and coloring it'd be very difficult to
