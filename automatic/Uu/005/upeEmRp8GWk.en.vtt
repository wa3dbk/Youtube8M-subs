00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
patches okay there so diesel turns

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.760 
patches okay there so diesel turns
darker<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> week<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:19.020> scale<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
darker for about a week and scale up and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.620 
darker for about a week and scale up and
fall<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:20.130> these<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.760> stickers<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.510> have

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fall off these are stickers so we have

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090 
fall off these are stickers so we have
to<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> treat<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.289> harder<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> okay

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
to kind of treat them harder you okay

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.009 
to kind of treat them harder you okay
sometimes<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> gives<00:00:24.300> us<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.660> brain

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
sometimes it gives us a little brain

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.600 
sometimes it gives us a little brain
freeze<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> ones<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:31.650> hair<00:00:31.949> tend<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> kind

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
freeze the ones in our hair tend to kind

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.860 
freeze the ones in our hair tend to kind
of<00:00:32.669> come<00:00:32.880> back<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.270> faster<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
of come back a little faster because I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.770

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
think they're a little bit within our

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.209 
think they're a little bit within our
hair<00:00:36.780> follicle<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> hide<00:00:38.040> from

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
them kind of stays around and go when we

00:00:41.489 --> 00:01:02.349 
them kind of stays around and go when we
freeze<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.879> let<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> couple<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> these

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.289 

liquid<00:01:03.359> nitrogen<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:05.000> if<00:01:06.000> they're

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
liquid nitrogen like this if they're

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880
