00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.270
 will hello to you all enough 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 welcome atomium on indymac in a 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 new indie preview today I 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.910
 I'll be able to talk to you about 4 lateral 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 damaged which is a game with history my 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.139
 faith not banal is a kind of project 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 delirium that is to say that in fact the guy he 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 made a joke he said bastien 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 on the internet I'm going to swing a young 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.869
 browser we're going to play a cat we're going 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 to type objects we will make them fall 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.260
 we're going to fuck the dawa we're going to iron wire and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 this a few youtuber it will walk from 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.580
 thunder and the bet has been worthily 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 successful since it's a game of which very 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
 a lot of people have heard about it and in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.170
 did what happened was that of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
 he decided to make a version 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 larger scale and so he has 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 tried to get financed on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 kickstarter he managed to height 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 a few tens of thousands of dollars and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.110
 so the version I'm going to show you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 here is the version that has been rendered 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 available for people who have bac and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 the project likely quest 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.730
 side of a match should come out on 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 steam in the month of May so I do not know 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.920
 it's not an online version focused on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 a full version was not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 specified for the moment in any case you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.020
 go see what suddenly looks like the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.609
 game and see a little bit of what it gives 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.390
 a pre-game side cat more 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.989
 large format 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 my faith we'll see we'll see that together 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.689
 then there are two modes available you 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 have the goal mode and the monitor 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.990
 boxing we will launch the objective mode which 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 is I think more speaking is so it's 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.960
 the one we're actually going to have 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.180
 a lot of things to do is to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 say levels should level with 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.840
 here is this little cat that we will embody 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.790
 and in fact we will be asked to do 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 one and only thing is to do 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 falling objects so there for example 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.330
 see hop I can give shots of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 legs with triggers not trigger 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.520
 right trigger left 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.759
 I can also do a paw 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 like that frontal with rb and lb is in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.310
 does my goal and the one that is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 indicated at the top left of the screen at 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.939
 know how to bring down two hundred objects 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.140
 with a secondary goal that is him 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.450
 indicated below is to do 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.340
 therefore fall 25 objects of this form that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.570
 indicated to me is so this thing down there 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 must be free red is not about 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.880
 nonsense so in the meantime we will try 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.370
 to see that so I can jump well 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.530
 obviously like this 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.790
 and so that must be it yes it's okay 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 so here I 'm going to make it fall like this 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.020
 25 to have a secondary objective and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 so we're going to chain the courses then this 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 Standard courses are quite enough 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.330
 done it's pretty funny because on 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.800
 kickstarter years with the bearings of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.270
 funding there was put then is the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.860
 blow all the time of thousands of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.020
 dollars I will propose a new level 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.940
 you will have the museum you will have this this 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.810
 and it's good overall levels get 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 look like a little bit anyway 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.080
 do not mess around and what's going on 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.940
 is that you're going to have a lot of pain 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.530
 things to do anyway but by 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.690
 against I tell you right away there is a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.190
 many times this I know it's just 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.750
 ultra repetitive 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.670
 it's a crazy thing to say that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.600
 here we are doing this so here is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 from time to time we have like that 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.990
 events that will pop and and there in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.550
 the occurrence I have is gravity 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.410
 lunar so that means that I could 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.210
 jump much higher the same see 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.500
 when I throw objects 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.360
 there will be a much bigger return 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.490
 and so it will be necessary to compose also with 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.470
 these stuff there for just that's it 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.210
 try 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.010
 to get the best possible scores 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.090
 I do not know if we can not succeed in 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.050
 do the secondary goal like this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.610
 might not be too bad since the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.020
 see the one I dropped and there the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.410
 red book is still not the most 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.060
 difficult 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.620
 so we'll see that so I've 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.540
 almost everything in terms of books 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.140
 and stay here here tac a shelf 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.670
 we are almost at the end see 22 23 and there 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.200
 I think I can catch the last 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.880
 then to get a candy this very 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.410
 very high then in terms of interface in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.520
 done you can see the objects that 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.380
 you make fall because they are 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.580
 indicated on the top right of the screen and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.780
 here it is so suddenly as I did 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.700
 my secondary goal i'm going to grab 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.920
 a new strike so a little box 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.390
 like sakic hip hop in front of me and I 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.070
 I'll be able to press the cross key 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.470
 to be able like that then not 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.440
 better to love it to bite and destroy it 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.580
 and here she is so little has been 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.900
 relatively interesting of the game that for 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.400
 the shot I think it's cool you 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.709
 have a small side rpg actually in 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.390
 which one asks you to recover 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.560
 like that points is actually these 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.150
 points are visible points here this 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.410
 are stats points so you go 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.490
 power like that you move so 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.200
 a little more crazy you will be able 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.940
 jump more and more to the hitting 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.650
 louder so we'll say that 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.910
 the data is interesting I 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.560
 want to tell you really know 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.140
 why not through against maybe one 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.670
 classic experience system with 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.860
 precisely the number of objects that falls 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.090
 it would have been a little more catchy 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.230
 because here it's true that every 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.610
 end of level we will get points 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.690
 except that there are not really any systems 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.980
 backup that is to say that there by 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.310
 example I did a game yesterday pretty 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.410
 long 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.310
 and when I came back on the game for 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.540
 you do this video but I was 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.380
 starting from scratch so buy a little 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.060
 little disappointed I think it's a shame 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.019
 because it does not encourage us to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.420
 come back I think that will be corrected 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.950
 this being after good ben this is it to 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.570
 to say that there in terms of concept you 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.239
 will see like that you really only have 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.350
 so I do not know the price of the final game 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.780
 I imagine it will be around the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.720
 ten or fifteen euros but it's 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.370
 true that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.019
 that's funny actually on a game 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.130
 browser these voices where it's the kind 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.630
 of stuff you're going out a buddy actually 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.560
 you are at a friend's house telling you that you 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.610
 do not know that at ground there but I 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.350
 wait for me i watch i show you everything 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.910
 except that the problem is that from this 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.100
 delusion there arises a game that is him 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.300
 paying that further down here is a cost 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.890
 certain price even imagined 10 euros 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.750
 it's almost the price of a horse 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.830
 night for example or other games 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.940
 really cool is the price turmoil 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.580
 Men do not say stupidity here 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.930
 it hurts a bit to say that for 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.270
 a simple delirium we will have a game 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.950
 like that complete I have nothing against the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.270
 principle but it's true that here we are 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.790
 find a little bit the side I'm kidding 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 of simulator god and I confess that I can 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.940
 not I can not decently you 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.190
 encourage to take this kind of stuff there 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.430
 let's go here we go to that one 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.510
 get the point of move and job 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.560
 that's fine and then we 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.240
 we only have to go back to a 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.680
 small cardboard to finish the level 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.300
 after that it's true that I think for 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.350
 people who like games very delirious 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.460
 and all that and who are not fooled 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.990
 the requirement may well be because at 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.669
 side of that I would still like 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.840
 emphasize two things that in my opinion 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.220
 are very important is that this game has 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.660
 already an art direction that is 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.000
 certainly very simple and but who for the 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.110
 blow works quite with his 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.669
 theme so from this point of view this is 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.470
 really a success and the other thing 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.490
 is that real side is clean it's 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.630
 really clean so it's not at all 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.950
 ambitious clearly but that's enough 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.870
 clean there is no really there is 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.310
 worry we say ah that's bad fuck 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.210
 it's badly done finally there is no 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.710
 really shocking thing 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.110
 it's just that the concept is more in 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.070
 10 minutes what but after outside of 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.170
 salah 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.360
 relief the technical quality of the game is 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.010
 not in question and I would like to emphasize 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.140
 because on the other hand it was not at all 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.160
 case on other games like this 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.140
 that we could possibly have 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.180
 present so here I really wanted 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.220
 to insist on it is not really the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.390
 general quality of the title and of what 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.500
 been done it's not the job of the 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.170
 wholesale developer when involved but 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
 it is rather beautiful the desired theme 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.380
 approach and the fact that it does not work 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.110
 not very well actually just 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.340
 here after I'm sure they publish 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.450
 for that so at least you have some 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.370
 heard about you know that can you 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.540
 interest or not and suddenly you are 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.440
 only judge anyway in the 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.580
 comments it's always fun too 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.660
 to read you and see a little opinion 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.680
 that they are confronted fight do not hesitate 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.210
 not if you ever find it's a 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.410
 game to defend absolutely not made the 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.700
 and if you ever find it's a 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.200
 game on the contrary which is rather low not 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.700
 really up to what we 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.410
 could wait or in any case 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.790
 maybe a little too much I do not know me 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.740
 opportunistic or anything ben 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.120
 do not hesitate to step by the wavy 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.470
 let's fight together it's always 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.800
 always a pleasure go on this I'm going 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.630
 leave you 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.860

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.680
 yes we feel good sense here is well and well 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.510
 take good care of yourself and lower the 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.580
 next for a new video 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.580
