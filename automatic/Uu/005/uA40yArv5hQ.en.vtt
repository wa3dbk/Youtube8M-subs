00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 all beaver dear friends are my feet 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 have long been asked when the form comes out 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.919
 iphone version when iphone version comes out 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 generally yes 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.160
 iphone version finally came out then i think 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 somewhere 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 a day ago she came out went out to the appstore and 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.050
 now you can play five nights at 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.260
 freddy's 4 on my ipad and iphone 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.269
 for only three dollars but it's 180 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180
 rubles like I can now with pathos 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.680
 say you can bring nightmares with 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 yourself in your iphone 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.960
 to any bus school or university 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 or where else can you play there 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.360
 games little remarochka guys in iphone 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 version there is one picture which is not 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.660
 was not on the pc version on the version for 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.090
 android 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.250
 what makes me think that where there 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 there is one different picture 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 maybe something else different 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 so guys if you suddenly see 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.910
 any differences in iphone or android 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.969
 version from the version on the letter 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.559
 then be sure to email me either 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.400
 comments either in vk 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.049
 because the last times in fnaf 3 were 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 quite a lot of cove 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 different they helped 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 understand where the elements are important to the plot 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 and where is not important for the plot give an example 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.650
 let's say in fnaf 3 there were 5 in the mini game 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.619
 battle scores yes she android version instead 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.350
 5 there stands 3 balun battle of this can 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 to conclude that their number does not have 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.259
 meaning for the plot because otherwise their 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.240
 the amount would be the same in the iphone 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.670
 version and in android version 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 and in the version of the letter but they are different 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.439
 then they are made there just for decoration 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 here somehow there are such reasonings and they 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.750
 allow us to determine what is important for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 plot 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.220
 why do you know a member so if you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.500
 find something interesting 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.140
 be sure to write and after a few 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.700
 days you can make a video where you can 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 will talk about the differences 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.280
 iphone android and recording versions from this 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 make some interesting conclusions well 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.509
 Well guys on this all hope you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.250
 I like it if you are an iPhone owner 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.340
 you can rejoice because 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.539
 finally and you can play and there 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.730
 all androids andru 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.459
 species is now the only platform on 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.769
 which there is no sheep and it looks like there will be no 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.530
 This windows phone I do not know why but 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.599
 scott said nothing about what he 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.159
 will release the version on windows phone 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.250
 maybe he has some problems with 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.840
 porting games and or something else but he 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.819
 when he did the first news 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.920
 He said that I will release on android and a little 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.109
 later on iphone about windows phone he 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.909
 said nothing at all as if about 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.920
 him okay guys on this all 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.489
 I hope you enjoyed it bye bye 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.489
