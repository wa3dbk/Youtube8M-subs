00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.450 

this<00:03:25.950> mod<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> horrible<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:28.130> think<00:03:29.130> it's<00:03:29.280> one<00:03:29.370> of

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.680 
this mod is horrible I think it's one of
them<00:03:29.550> where<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:29.790> hitting<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.090> too<00:03:30.270> slow<00:03:30.570> and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
them where I'm hitting it too slow and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.910 
them where I'm hitting it too slow and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's hard if you've got a bit quicker

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.120 
it's hard if you've got a bit quicker
it's<00:03:32.130> easier

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.970

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.640 

well<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.570> think<00:06:02.690> it'll<00:06:02.870> be<00:06:02.990> interesting<00:06:03.110> going

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
the other way you know it's sort of all

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.380 
the other way you know it's sort of all
downhill<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.760> bet<00:06:07.970> it<00:06:08.060> would<00:06:08.120> be<00:06:08.210> more<00:06:08.360> fun

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
downhill I bet it would be more fun

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:18.280 
downhill I bet it would be more fun
going<00:06:08.630> uphill<00:06:16.030> so<00:06:17.030> much<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.360> led<00:06:17.510> ups<00:06:17.900> much<00:06:18.110> I'm

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
going uphill so much it led ups much I'm

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:30.850 
going uphill so much it led ups much I'm
not<00:06:18.320> going<00:06:18.680> off<00:06:19.780> beast

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:41.930 

well<00:06:39.949> so<00:06:40.949> you<00:06:41.009> kind<00:06:41.340> of<00:06:41.460> following<00:06:41.789> like<00:06:41.910> a

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
well so you kind of following like a

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.340 
well so you kind of following like a
little<00:06:42.210> stream<00:06:42.479> down<00:06:42.720> here<00:06:42.900> a<00:06:42.930> lot<00:06:43.050> but<00:06:43.229> at

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
little stream down here a lot but at

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.860 
little stream down here a lot but at
times<00:06:43.560> you're<00:06:43.830> in<00:06:43.889> it<00:06:44.150> the<00:06:45.150> times<00:06:45.419> you're<00:06:45.630> next

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
times you're in it the times you're next

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.040 
times you're in it the times you're next
to<00:06:45.990> it<00:06:46.940> so<00:06:47.940> that's<00:06:48.060> obviously<00:06:48.449> what's<00:06:48.660> keeping

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
to it so that's obviously what's keeping

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:59.700 
to it so that's obviously what's keeping
it<00:06:49.139> damp

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.189 

but<00:07:00.580> maybe<00:07:00.940> that's<00:07:01.150> why<00:07:01.389> it<00:07:01.449> says<00:07:01.690> no<00:07:01.930> through

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
but maybe that's why it says no through

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.770 
but maybe that's why it says no through
road<00:07:02.380> for<00:07:02.560> motor<00:07:02.740> vehicles<00:07:03.509> but<00:07:04.509> I<00:07:04.539> don't

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
road for motor vehicles but I don't

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.510 
road for motor vehicles but I don't
understand<00:07:05.229> how<00:07:05.350> you<00:07:05.470> can<00:07:05.650> have<00:07:05.740> a<00:07:05.800> byway<00:07:06.280> that

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
understand how you can have a byway that

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.520 
understand how you can have a byway that
isn't<00:07:07.000> a<00:07:07.180> through<00:07:07.479> Road<00:07:07.780> but<00:07:08.169> you're<00:07:08.320> allowed

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
isn't a through Road but you're allowed
