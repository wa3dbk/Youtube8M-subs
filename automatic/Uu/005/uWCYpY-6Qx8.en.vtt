00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.629
 good jr thank you very much for 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.510
 treat us with what sensation faces and 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.630
 if this cup america not for enchanted of 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.660
 be here with you talking as 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.259
 good with the feeling and the association 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.079
 of encouragement not of joy I think for 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.900
 we Dominicans playing this 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.200
 fruit of returns is something special 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.720
 we know 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.460
 the historical importance of a 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.930
 america cup 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.500
 we know the tradition that 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.320
 and what do they have today 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.220
 and Quique vibrates and lives as 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:50.620
 people and for us to play it 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.470
 is particular that is not the tournament that 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.070
 corresponds to us by the area but 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.890
 but good every time we play it with 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 the illusion of doing good paper to have 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.360
 Gold Cup America 's Cup in its 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.550
 challenge for you if you say and is is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.740
 difficult for mexico strong this 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.759
 tournament because we have to divide 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.940
 between gold cup and cup america is 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.060
 complicated because the same selection does not 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.000
 can be in both tournaments 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.909
 in two months in which you can not 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.149
 have the players concentrated on 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.799
 all the time because some end 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.570
 tournament and immediately join to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.149
 a tournament after there is no vacation and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.409
 start other tournaments is difficult 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:42.759
 it's hard we wish we could play it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.970
 with the strong team not because also 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.530
 we have the problem that the cup 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.780
 america to us as doctors 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.000
 guests does not give us the pass to the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.330
 confederations and that's why we're 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.920
 forced to play the gold cup 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.990
 well that takes a point more than 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.849
 importance but good not either 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.429
 we throw what the america cup does not 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.229
 play the most every time we are 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.599
 in a tournament we try to get as much 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.970
 far possible always talking about that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.400
 copa america is the goal be the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.980
 title why 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.049
 personally, I like that staff 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 every time we play a tournament I like it 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.780
 always think about winning when you play and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.220
 complete is for something 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.810
 I consider myself the winner and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.500
 being there they have more 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 possibilities that others are difficult 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.700
 it's not easy there are not very selections 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 strong but we have not been so far 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.670
 I already Mexico was close in a couple of 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.670
 final 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.209
 that has been played by the third or 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.680
 fourth place I had to live in the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.099
 america cup of venezuela 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.459
 and we are there we are not close is not 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.090
 simple because I repeat for having to 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:11.170
 put together two campuses and focus a bit 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.939
 more in the gold cup but but hey this 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.000
 it's football you have to play is eleven against 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.020
 eleven and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.240
 better and that is that the insurance is going to 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.820
 make the effort to get to the 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.510
 final how do you value your options 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.880
 in that group chile ecuador bolivia 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.640
 Complicated Complications of the Two 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.290
 teams many times on paper it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.820
 can say that some are stronger 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 than others but currently there is no 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.340
 rival the single not currently 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.800
 all elections have become very 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.950
 competitive have become 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 very difficult to win with very matches 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.800
 equalized and good to play against Chile 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:03.510
 it has something different from the other parties 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.460
 it's going to be totally visiting but 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.460
 totally 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.930
 it's a nice match to play I think 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.900
 that can motivate us to get a better 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.480
 result without a doubt I do it as the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.430
 more complicated match without 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.710
 without diminishing importance to others 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.020
 maybe chile part bottom and favoritism 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.160
 for playing at home yes yes yes of course 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.820
 they are local and without a doubt they are the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.720
 group favorites that they know 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.090
 they assume it 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.120
 and well we know about the difficulty that goes 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.220
 to have this game but we respect it 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.190
 a lot because it does not scare us like 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.700
 selection does not motivate us to have this 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.560
 kind of scenarios is going to be beautiful and they are 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.900
 of the parties that to one set list 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.520
 of he likes to have we have to look at the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.800
 last world to have a reference 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.300
 of which will be mythical 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.569
 Well, look, I think 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.750
 is going to be going to be is going to try to 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:11.349
 keep this line different because 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.720
 as I repeat you it will not be depends what 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.580
 let the coach say what he says 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.840
 miguel herrera who go gold cup and 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.820
 America Cup 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.380
 is difficult because it has to arm the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.250
 schools 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:29.180
 Maybe it's all different from the one 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.040
 world and good in selections there is very 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.410
 little time to work and more when 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.610
 you have to make two selections always 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.610
 it is more difficult
