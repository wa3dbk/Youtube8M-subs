00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.170
 first 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.170
 to the bounce 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.949
 echeverría no 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.279
 chilies 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 very good play prepared although it arises 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 after the bounce they armed it valued in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 the corner from the left and rodrigo 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.630
 team of hugo tocalli has 1 venezuela 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.460
 0 echeverría the 6 minutes 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.570
 tocalli had mentioned that he did not have 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.500
 definition and in the first 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.600
 that comes with danger join those of the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.390
 background because the one that comes out of that play 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.829
 to define using the loop is the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.200
 three sticks there is a short bounce and the one that 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.330
 it takes advantage is echeverría or the two 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.240
 central banks in full vocation 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.979
 Chile up on the first arrival

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.890
 days 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.240
 and it was almost a blow to hit it ponce 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.240
 vegan spent five days 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.750
 to see 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.350
 vargas 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.610
 red itchy itchy itches and it hangs 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.610

 second time south 2 and got into the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.450
 medium without profile or for your leg more 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 You know and defined about Velázquez Chile 2 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.810
 venezuela 0 caves the power of goal that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.960
 Chilean had the first time what 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.890
 get in these few arrivals before 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.000
 Venezuela 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.870
 who defends with 10 who plays with 10 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.870
 the expulsion of vargas 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 there is a good rating he finds 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.910
 in the recoil to Velázquez 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.380
 This ride is exquisite 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.810
 already lets chop the number 15 caves can 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.240
 habilitation of red as a pitcher in 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.220
 the middle 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.800
 there is a slap but it is not effective 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.710
 of Velázquez two arrivals and a half if 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.680
 you want for Chile two cries for the 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.330
 set of tocalli the expense he did 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.490
 Venezuela 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.240
 the points are taken by our 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.570
 blood 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.340
 well that's over ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.710
 46 minutes for a lot more the referee is 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.530
 relieved of some time ago Chile won 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.390
 won the red by hugo tocalli with goals 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.250
 of echeverría at 6 minutes from the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.110
 first part and of caves at 3 in the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.900
 Complement chile 2 venezuela 0 2 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.670
 different times we have seen in this 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.810
 first presentation with victory 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.300
 Chilean that rearranges so many in the table 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.600
 of positions after having tasted 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.990
 with fall to Brazil 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.150
 marked the start with echeverría after 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.940
 it was all of venezuela in the first 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.750
 time the situation on the ball 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.720
 arrivals but nothing concrete in 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.710
 the complement without savarino for me of 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:56.420
 the best of the Venezuelan set 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:59.090
 Chile turned the expulsion of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.240
 vargas was also adding up so that the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 party go changing hands on course 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.010
 won in confidence to tocalli set 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.470
 he got the first three points 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.480
 ended up playing with superiority 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.030
 number by the last expulsion of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.530
 cermeño the two laterals in the set 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.239
 of chen aus and saw the red 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.849
 ramirez that I enter 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.720
 he could also have deserved the last 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.720
 but it relented haro 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.860
 well things 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.469
 Chile 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.969
 be comfortable and until they play Brazil and 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.969
 Uruguay also has 3
