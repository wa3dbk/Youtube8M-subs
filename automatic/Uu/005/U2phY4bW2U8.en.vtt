00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.550
 how could they notice 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.349
 it looks a little better and it's because 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.990
 time to get some new cameras 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'm already super super super happy with 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.240
 good see in the title of trabajito them 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.650
 came the video that is in backpack and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.359
 I decided to do it because that's the way 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.369
 finish the semester and then he wants us 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.960
 show you mind a very video 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 entertaining I like this kind of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 videos and I hope you like them and if I eat 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.769
 I told them what I could have done for 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.410
 a lot of time but I do not know why not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.410
 I did in said but it takes months 3 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.450
 so I decided to do it and well we're going to 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 see what's in my backpack this is my 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.180
 backpack and in the back-to- school hub 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.940
 different to medicine where it was from and 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.610
 a local store in my city ​​I do not know how 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.070
 they are called an agreement and at zero total 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.040
 and yes it is a floral print the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 it's like that and it has pink flowers and 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.510
 I love being whenever you want a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.960
 backpack of this kind and enchanted half 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.360
 Seriously supports everything I carry and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.850
 let's have the probe and well 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.310
 I'm going to start teaching them what I have 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 in this part that are rather like that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 my notebooks books and that kind of thing 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.869
 and then let's see what's good opens 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.450
 well and it 's images and since you open it brings 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.420
 these like strings like that and what 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 first I bring is my klein case 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 which is of black and white strips that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.530
 I really love this pattern 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 I really like it, I do not know, it fascinates me 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 assured that very basic elegant I do not know me 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.259
 love and then I bring pigment 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 colors because when I write I love 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.149
 that continue as very colorful and I do not know 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.330
 about the little things women I am in case 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.490
 I colored pens mark texts or not 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.350
 yellow or orange and a little rose and me 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.100
 I love the brand texts down 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.569
 a baby stapler is very small and I 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.049
 love it for guys it can take 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.209
 everywhere a black pen a pencil or 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.670
 a very small pencil and these 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.519
 they love it because when you get the point 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.860
 smell or bring aroma and this was 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.620
 orange and she very rich 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.450
 a pencil sharpener and finally I 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.900
 I realized that I bring money and I bring 3 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.390
 pesos with 50 cents I'm rich already 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.850
 then a cap came because in the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.120
 recreation I like to eat apple 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.850
 he bit it and I 'm sorry here and it has 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.740
 been because I'm done and if I love 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.500
 because it's pink and I like it 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.840
 I just gave a lot of attention 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.920
 two calculators and this is from my brother 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.780
 so 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.790
 after I returned them and there was no 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.200
 mind that he was wearing this and then he is 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.340
 like something good to do this kind of 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.340
 videos you find things 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.290
 a little brush because you look a lot at 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.420
 hair then sometimes choose kitchen 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.520
 I have to brush to make it look good 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.550
 of itself when all disheveled like this 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.130
 I feel like a brush or a success 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.200
 obviously it's like that something basic to 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.430
 to wear we did not take off because you did not 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.320
 go to take the one of your giant house 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.290
 because if you're not going to be very happy 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.280
 then better not chic I wear you saw like 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.110
 little touch with dried cranberries 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.300
 because they know very rich I love 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.400
 that certainly makes me hungry because I 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.180
 as in some they are super rich in 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.130
 Serious are like popcorn I do not know I like them 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.200
 a lot and lately like they gave me 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.900
 want to draw and color so 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.210
 I'm successful with colors to the color 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.660
 It was a pen I do not know how they say 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.000
 where he lives 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.160
 with colors by system cravings for him or 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.770
 something like that 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.230
 obviously I carry notebooks this is 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.930
 this one of economic structures of mexico 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.150
 and it's also English and this is from 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.430
 literature and I love it because it 's the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.410
 minions and it is beautiful we have given 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.420
 a lot and we have seen that it is a 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.580
 organizer for my physics jobs 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.030
 because my teacher gives us sheets with 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.370
 problems or with information then 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.860
 we are accommodating what I have here and we have 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.510
 to the first partial second partial third 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.850
 partial and this would be the fourth partial 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.470
 but the room still does not give us anything 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.470
 partial because we still do not get well 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.960
 I want then then here I have leaves 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.370
 white and in three I recommend a lot 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.190
 take something like that to make your 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.710
 jobs or things like that because the other 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.240
 semester I used to be like that one 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.280
 it was the army nothing else and the whole area 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.320
 suddenly my hand folded 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.390
 so this has helped me a lot 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.700
 have my jobs organized so 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.320
 I recommend them a lot and finally 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.830
 carry books 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.870
 be of English physics and literature 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.430
 and I just discovered that at the most 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.300
 deep in my backpack bring the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.040
 scissors this is dangerous games yes ones 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.690
 scissors that did not beat them what 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.240
 I have in these parts and you're going to 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.730
 begin with is visibly I carry a 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.010

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.240

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.520
 gone eating these bars and I did not 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.800
 I have tired in service and very rich 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.190

 swine heat or if I feel that the 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.070
 change is bothering me a lot because I 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.990
 I make a tail I come back for the style and 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.300
 On the other side, the only thing I bring is my 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.030
 water bottle that is empty because in 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.680
