total<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.230> four<00:01:55.530> sections<00:01:56.190> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.460> entire

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
total of four sections for the entire

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
total of four sections for the entire
bottom<00:01:57.420> half<00:01:58.460> okay<00:01:59.460> moving<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.030> release<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
bottom half okay moving on release the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
bottom half okay moving on release the
top<00:02:01.200> half<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:02.010> gonna<00:02:02.100> split<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.580> hair

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
top half and we're gonna split the hair

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.570 
top half and we're gonna split the hair
in<00:02:02.910> two<00:02:03.240> working<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.140> half<00:02:04.410> at<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> time<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.340> just

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
in two working one half at a time I just

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.730 
in two working one half at a time I just
have<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> ton<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> hair<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> makes<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
have a ton of hair so this makes it more

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
have a ton of hair so this makes it more
manageable<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.420> first<00:02:09.750> half

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
manageable so with that first half

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
manageable so with that first half
stretched<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.890> hair<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.550> see<00:02:11.760> how

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
stretched out the hair just to see how

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.730 
stretched out the hair just to see how
it<00:02:11.970> will<00:02:12.120> lay<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.630> pulling<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> hair<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it will lay I'm pulling the hair in the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.190 
it will lay I'm pulling the hair in the
front<00:02:14.040> down<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.850> create<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> tapered<00:02:15.930> bob

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
front down to create that tapered bob

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.560 
front down to create that tapered bob
look<00:02:16.560> longer<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.550> front<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> shorter<00:02:18.480> in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
look longer in the front and shorter in

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.240 
look longer in the front and shorter in
the<00:02:18.600> back<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.040> hair<00:02:20.220> on

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the back and as you can see the hair on

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.370 
the back and as you can see the hair on
top<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.850> way<00:02:21.180> too<00:02:21.240> long<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:21.990> completely

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
top is way too long and it completely

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260 
top is way too long and it completely
covers<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> short<00:02:23.310> hair<00:02:23.490> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> bottom<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
covers a short hair on the bottom so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.180 
covers a short hair on the bottom so
let's<00:02:24.300> fix<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.260> gonna<00:02:25.560> create<00:02:25.950> more

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
let's fix that I'm gonna create more

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.970 
let's fix that I'm gonna create more
natural<00:02:26.520> looking<00:02:27.180> gradual<00:02:27.810> layers<00:02:28.050> starting

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
natural looking gradual layers starting

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.890 
natural looking gradual layers starting
in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> front<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:29.820> gonna<00:02:30.120> move<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.540> very

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
in the front I'm gonna move that very

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.620 
in the front I'm gonna move that very
top<00:02:31.290> layer<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.590> hair<00:02:32.040> aside<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.360> gonna

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
top layer of hair aside so I'm gonna

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110 
top layer of hair aside so I'm gonna
grab<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.140> bottom<00:02:34.650> section<00:02:34.950> directly<00:02:35.910> behind

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
grab that bottom section directly behind

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
grab that bottom section directly behind
the<00:02:36.450> hair<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> front<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.290> giving<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the hair in the front I'm giving it a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.310 
the hair in the front I'm giving it a
twist<00:02:38.160> at<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.400> root<00:02:38.700> wrapping<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.450> into<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> bun

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
twist at the root wrapping it into a bun

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.160 
twist at the root wrapping it into a bun
and<00:02:40.650> allowing<00:02:41.459> enough<00:02:41.910> ends<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.570> hang<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
and allowing enough ends to hang to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.740 
and allowing enough ends to hang to
create<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.590> gradual<00:02:44.280> tapered<00:02:44.850> look<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.420> pin

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
create a gradual tapered look then pin

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.930 
create a gradual tapered look then pin
the<00:02:45.900> bun<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.140> place<00:02:46.170> moving<00:02:46.980> towards<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.700> back

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060 
the bun in place moving towards the back
of<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.180> head<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.630> move<00:02:48.959> aside<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.500> top<00:02:49.800> layer

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
of the head I move aside the top layer

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.370 
of the head I move aside the top layer
again<00:02:50.640> grabbing<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.450> loose<00:02:51.720> hair<00:02:51.989> directly

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
again grabbing the loose hair directly

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.520 
again grabbing the loose hair directly
underneath<00:02:52.950> twist<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.970> bun<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> pin<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.410> at

underneath twist it bun it and pin it at

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.740 
underneath twist it bun it and pin it at
the<00:02:55.680> roots<00:02:55.920> allowing<00:02:56.670> enough<00:02:57.060> hair<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.360> fall

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the roots allowing enough hair to fall

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.800 
the roots allowing enough hair to fall
for<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> gradual<00:02:58.709> layered<00:02:59.130> look<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.450> place

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
for a gradual layered look and now place

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.350 
for a gradual layered look and now place
the<00:03:01.080> top<00:03:01.350> layers<00:03:01.680> over<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.400> bun<00:03:02.640> delayers<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the top layers over the bun delayers you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.570 
the top layers over the bun delayers you
just<00:03:03.630> created<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.380> buns<00:03:04.620> will<00:03:04.890> create<00:03:05.190> enough

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
just created the buns will create enough

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.850 
just created the buns will create enough
volume<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.330> make<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.660> top<00:03:06.959> layer<00:03:06.989> appear

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
volume to make the top layer appear

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.070 
volume to make the top layer appear
shorter<00:03:08.370> without<00:03:08.790> any<00:03:09.060> pinning<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.720> release

wrap them into a bun and pin the bun in
place<00:03:22.530> allowing<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.549> ends<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.090> hang<00:03:24.299> out<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
place allowing the ends that hang out to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.619

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.180 

now<00:03:29.629> I<00:03:30.019> need<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.590> rid<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.799> some<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.129> this

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
now I need to get rid of some of this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.820 
now I need to get rid of some of this
links<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.420> get<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.750> top<00:03:33.019> layer<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
links so get that top layer out of the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.559 
links so get that top layer out of the
way<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.280> work<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.879> those<00:03:35.000> long<00:03:35.299> layers

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
way and work on those long layers

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.640 
way and work on those long layers
underneath<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:38.629> just<00:03:38.870> keep<00:03:39.080> twisting

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
underneath so just keep twisting

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.979 
underneath so just keep twisting
blending<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.340> pinning<00:03:40.940> those<00:03:41.120> inside<00:03:41.690> layers

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
blending and pinning those inside layers
