00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
eyelid and it's always good idea to

eyelid and it's always good idea to
apply<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> black<00:01:44.340> eyeshadow<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.970> layers

apply the black eyeshadow in layers

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
apply the black eyeshadow in layers
use<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> little<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> build<00:01:47.640> up

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
use a little bit at a time and build up

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
use a little bit at a time and build up
the<00:01:48.000> intensity<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> elongate<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the intensity I like to elongate the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
the intensity I like to elongate the
shape<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.600> eyes<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:52.229> pulling<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
shape of my eyes by pulling the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.499 
shape of my eyes by pulling the
eyeshadow<00:01:53.159> upwards<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.759> outwards<00:01:53.880> towards

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
eyeshadow upwards and outwards towards

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.569 
eyeshadow upwards and outwards towards
the<00:01:54.780> end<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.079> brow<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.619> find<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> shape

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the end of my brow I find the shape

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.069 
the end of my brow I find the shape
really<00:01:56.909> helps<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> blending<00:01:57.869> process

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
really helps with the blending process

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.469 
really helps with the blending process
if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.040> blend<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> line<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.240> can't

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
if you blend it in that line you can't

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
if you blend it in that line you can't
really<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.960> wrong<00:02:01.200> once<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.369> pulled<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> color

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
really go wrong once I pulled the color

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
really go wrong once I pulled the color
up<00:02:03.210> into<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> crease<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.469> soften

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
up into the crease I'm going to soften

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
up into the crease I'm going to soften
the<00:02:04.860> edges<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> fluffy<00:02:05.909> blending<00:02:06.030> brush

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the edges with a fluffy blending brush

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
the edges with a fluffy blending brush
I'm<00:02:07.049> using<00:02:07.259> back<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> forth<00:02:08.039> sweeping

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
I'm using back and forth sweeping

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.510 
I'm using back and forth sweeping
motions<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.360> disperse<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.050> color<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> with

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
motions to disperse the color so with

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
motions to disperse the color so with
blending<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.569> lost<00:02:12.750> some<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
blending you will have lost some of the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
blending you will have lost some of the
city<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> black<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.239> said<00:02:15.510> applies

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
city of the black like I said applies

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.589 
city of the black like I said applies
and<00:02:16.290> layers<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.709> go<00:02:17.160> back<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.610> add<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.360> more

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
and layers just go back in add some more

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.630 
and layers just go back in add some more
and<00:02:19.050> repeat<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> process<00:02:19.800> until<00:02:20.340> you're

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and repeat the process until you're

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.050 
and repeat the process until you're
satisfied<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.569> color<00:02:21.750> payoff<00:02:22.849> black<00:02:23.849> on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
satisfied with the color payoff black on

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 
satisfied with the color payoff black on
zone<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:25.050> hard<00:02:25.319> color<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.709> blend

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
zone can be a very hard color to blend

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280 
zone can be a very hard color to blend
so<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.000> taking<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.569> bottom<00:02:28.080> left

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so I'm just taking the bottom left

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.920 
so I'm just taking the bottom left
contour<00:02:28.860> shade<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.430> help<00:02:29.640> blend<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.269> add<00:02:30.630> some

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
contour shade to help blend and add some

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.059 
contour shade to help blend and add some
warmth<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.800> eye<00:02:31.830> makeup<00:02:32.099> look<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:37.069> don't

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
warmth to the eye makeup look I don't

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.589 
warmth to the eye makeup look I don't
think<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:38.880> be<00:02:38.910> complete<00:02:39.420> without

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
think this look will be complete without

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.050 
think this look will be complete without
adding<00:02:40.260> some<00:02:40.500> winged<00:02:40.709> eyeliner<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
adding some winged eyeliner and this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.940 
adding some winged eyeliner and this

I'm taking this beautiful color and it's

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.840 
I'm taking this beautiful color and it's
kind<00:05:33.240> of<00:05:33.390> like<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.870> sparkly<00:05:34.800> pink<00:05:35.010> shade<00:05:35.370> it's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
kind of like a sparkly pink shade it's

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.850 
kind of like a sparkly pink shade it's
really<00:05:36.120> unique<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:36.900> I've<00:05:37.020> just<00:05:37.050> applied<00:05:37.350> this

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
really unique so I've just applied this

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.340 
really unique so I've just applied this
to<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.220> lips<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.730> started<00:05:39.480> off<00:05:39.570> by<00:05:39.600> outlining

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
to the lips I started off by outlining

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.950 
to the lips I started off by outlining
my<00:05:40.620> lips<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.430> then<00:05:41.490> I'm<00:05:41.700> going<00:05:41.910> to<00:05:42.450> leave<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
my lips and then I'm going to leave a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.770 
my lips and then I'm going to leave a
space<00:05:43.350> in<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.770> middle<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:44.250> go<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:45.300> a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
space in the middle and go in with a

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.140 
space in the middle and go in with a
really<00:05:46.320> nice<00:05:46.470> nude<00:05:46.830> lipstick<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.610> this<00:05:48.030> is

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
really nice nude lipstick and this is

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.360 
really nice nude lipstick and this is
probably<00:05:48.480> too<00:05:48.750> nude<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.320> wear<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.620> its<00:05:49.800> own<00:05:50.010> but

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
probably too nude to wear on its own but

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.040 
probably too nude to wear on its own but
pairs<00:05:50.670> with<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:50.910> liner<00:05:51.150> like<00:05:51.420> this<00:05:51.660> that<00:05:51.870> works

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
pairs with a liner like this that works

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.620 
pairs with a liner like this that works
fine<00:05:52.380> I've<00:05:52.800> just<00:05:53.340> applied<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:54.060> lips<00:05:54.330> and

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
fine I've just applied to the lips and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.810 
fine I've just applied to the lips and
then<00:05:54.900> blended<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:55.560> out<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:56.010> then<00:05:56.490> re

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
then blended it out and then re

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.330 
then blended it out and then re
intensified<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:58.260> liner<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:59.100> outer

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
intensified the liner on the outer

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.130 
intensified the liner on the outer
corners<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.300> make<00:06:00.420> everything<00:06:00.780> blend

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
corners to make everything blend

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.380 
corners to make everything blend
seamlessly<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:02.070> that<00:06:02.640> completes<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.180> look

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
seamlessly and that completes the look

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.810 
seamlessly and that completes the look
so<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:03.960> hope<00:06:04.200> you<00:06:04.380> enjoyed<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.920> tutorial<00:06:05.040> don't
