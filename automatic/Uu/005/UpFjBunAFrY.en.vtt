00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
application by tarla call ekak me and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960 
application by tarla call ekak me and
it's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> couponing<00:00:22.410> application<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.279> we're

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it's a couponing application that we're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
it's a couponing application that we're
going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.210> seeing<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.859> near<00:00:26.039> future

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be seeing in the near future

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
going to be seeing in the near future
because<00:00:26.699> well<00:00:27.470> NFC's<00:00:28.470> hot<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:28.980> days<00:00:30.080> so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
because well NFC's hot these days so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
because well NFC's hot these days so
basically<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.399> would

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
basically what we have here this would

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.060 
basically what we have here this would
be<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> backend<00:00:33.469> that<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.920> when

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
be the backend that you would see when

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
be the backend that you would see when
you<00:00:35.190> sign<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.880> you'd<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.329> choice<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you sign in so you'd have your choice of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
you sign in so you'd have your choice of
all<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.200> these<00:00:37.320> applications<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> top

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
all of these applications so the top

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
all of these applications so the top
downloads<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.020> coupons<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:41.700> all

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
downloads the coupons so these would all

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.170 
downloads the coupons so these would all
be<00:00:42.239> different<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.040> different<00:00:44.340> things

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
be different you know different things

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.900 
be different you know different things

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
maybe ten percent off let's see what's

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
maybe ten percent off let's see what's
in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.899> another<00:00:52.890> scription<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.520> yet<00:00:53.699> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in there another scription just yet but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.290 
in there another scription just yet but
we<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.090> choose<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.860> watch<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.219> video<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.180> if

pervasive<00:01:31.140> purchasing<00:01:31.799> card<00:01:32.009> using<00:01:32.340> NFC<00:01:33.110> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
pervasive purchasing card using NFC and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
pervasive purchasing card using NFC and
so<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.979> even<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.060> link<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so we even actually have this link to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
so we even actually have this link to
your<00:01:36.570> phone<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> demo<00:01:38.189> there's<00:01:38.460> actually

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
your phone in the demo there's actually

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.140 
your phone in the demo there's actually
a<00:01:38.820> few<00:01:38.970> other<00:01:39.150> options<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:39.950> for<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.790> oyster

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150

there's like just a whole bunch of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.830 
there's like just a whole bunch of
different<00:01:49.049> ways<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.189> could<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:50.840> NFC

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
different ways that we could see NFC

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
different ways that we could see NFC
being<00:01:52.049> used<00:01:52.200> by<00:01:52.409> by<00:01:52.710> carriers<00:01:53.220> yeah<00:01:54.090> octopus

being used by by carriers yeah octopus
card<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.110> mean<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.380> these<00:01:55.920> things<00:01:56.159> are<00:01:56.219> very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
card I mean all these things are very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.469 
card I mean all these things are very
very<00:01:56.700> viable<00:01:57.140> re<00:01:58.140> realistic<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.670> NFC<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
very viable re realistic for NFC in in

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.280 
very viable re realistic for NFC in in
the<00:02:00.600> near<00:02:00.750> near<00:02:00.990> future<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the near near future so if we take a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.370 
the near near future so if we take a
look<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> ability<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.460> share<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.200> can

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
look at the ability to share so we can

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.160 
look at the ability to share so we can
