00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.020
I’ve no freakin’ idea what that means…

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.600
Hello, guys!

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.484
Are we on air yet?

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:22.399
Ok…

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.940
Hello, guys! That’s NS again, and «I want to know» again.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.440
Let’s start watching cool stuff at once.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.760
First thing for today is Illusionists feature.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.420
This thing is that gems work on Illusions.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.100
Therefore, someone like Naga Siren becomes great counter

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.625
for heroes like Techies or Riki.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.645
And you can use Illusion with gems

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:42.165
to look for wards over whole map

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.780
without being afraid for your ass.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.380
Gems look great on support or carry Naga.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.680
So, if you are carry Naga, make your support get a gem for you!

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680
Omniknight is terrible support.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.645
He really is terrible!

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:56.455
If the game is long enough,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.140
it’s going to be really impossible to play against him.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.840
It’s all because of his Ultimate – it’s too strong!

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.940
But even the strongest one may fail, as people say.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.160
There are many ways to remove Omni’s Ultimate from enemies.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.780
For example, you can use Shadow Demon’s Ultimate, Eul, Diffusal or Doom.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.820
It means that even if you don’t have heroes,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.000
who can do something with Omniknight’s Ult,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.820
you can always buy an artifact to counter it.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.980
But all these ways work only for lone targets.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.360
And there are ways to remove Omniknight’s Ultimate from several characters at once.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.780
Brewmaster is the one you need for it.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.840
His blue spirit can dispel over the area.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.360
If he is close enough, Oracle can remove Omniknight’s Ultimate,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.922
using his first skill.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.340
But top place in our Omniknight fighters rating goes to Invoker.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.360
His Tornado has great AOE

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.020
and Omniknight’s Ult will be removed from everybody, who got in.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.269
A bit more about Omniknight.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:52.460
Ult is not the only strength of that hero.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.640
Actually, one of his main spells is Repel.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.260
And we all know that it gives magical invulnerability.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.900
But only few know that apart from that

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.440
it removes a lot of effects from the one it is casted on.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.600
We can use this feature to harm our enemies.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.140
For example, you can use Repel to remove rune effect from your enemy.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.200
It is most effective with Double Damage or Haste.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.980
In one of our previous issues

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.620
I told you about Axe killing couriers with his Ultimate.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.920
And now it’s time to tell you more on this theme.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.300
Beastmaster can use his Ultimate on couriers.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.015
And it even has repulsion effect on them.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:32.319
But there is no damage.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.840
Bane can tickle courier’s sides,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.111
but there is no damage either.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.640
Sniper shoots couriers blank…

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.660
But Slardar uses real Ultimate on them,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.573
decreasing their armor and making them visible.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.160
It can be really useful against flying couriers,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.951
who will be our scout.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.480
Common myth about Shaker killing every couriers with his Ultimate

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.470
should be refuted.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.600
No, he doesn’t kill them.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.340
But the tree can cast Living Armor on courier and save him this way.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.360
In our last issue I told you about originals ways Rubick can act.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.840
But he is not the only one who can do it.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.041
Tiny is another one.

00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.460
For example, on 30th second we can bother neutral creeps

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.685
and make them follow us.

00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:17.080
Then we use Toss to move neutral creeps to our ones

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.720
and voila! Easy money!

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.140
I’ve no freakin’ idea what that means…

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.980
I ran out of interesting facts for today again,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.700
but I’ll get some more for the next show.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.977
So if you want to be aware,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.260
subscribe to our channel and wait for the next issue.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.860
Hello, friends! That’s NS and that’s my show…

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.740
f@#$... I’m sick and tired of saying it every time…

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.648
But you need to say «hi» to people!

00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:53.172
Yeah, yeah…

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.600
And you can use Illusion with gems without being afraid for your ass…

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.320
No, no! I got to be more expressive!

00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:05.837
I forgot what’s it all about.

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:09.284
You can mount it somehow…

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.000
So if you are carry Naga, make your… No, not your.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.180
There is another word for it. Make them…

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.713
Yeah.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.740
So, if you are carry Naga, make your support get a gem for you!
