full aluminium one like the iPhone 5 I'm

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.850 
full aluminium one like the iPhone 5 I'm
not<00:02:23.330> saying<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.750> bad<00:02:23.780> thing<00:02:23.960> but<00:02:24.440> look

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
not saying that's a bad thing but look

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.620 
not saying that's a bad thing but look
whether<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.520> go<00:02:25.640> plastic<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> gal<00:02:26.480> the

whether you go plastic with you gal the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.580 
whether you go plastic with you gal the
medium<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:26.960> not<00:02:26.990> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> make<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> massive

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
medium is not going to make a massive

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.790 
medium is not going to make a massive
difference<00:02:28.120> inside<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.170> slot<00:02:30.560> for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
difference inside you have the slot for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.980 
difference inside you have the slot for
the<00:02:30.830> SIM<00:02:31.250> card<00:02:31.280> as<00:02:31.700> well<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> micro<00:02:32.330> SD<00:02:32.690> card

the SIM card as well as a micro SD card
as<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:33.800> as<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.190> put<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.459> battery<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.940> in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
as well as to put the battery in in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.150 
as well as to put the battery in in
there<00:02:35.450> now<00:02:36.020> what's<00:02:36.230> cool<00:02:36.440> obviously<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:36.980> can

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
there now what's cool obviously you can

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.580 
there now what's cool obviously you can
change<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.209> backplate<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.930> different<00:02:39.380> cases

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
change the backplate to different cases

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.350 
change the backplate to different cases
which<00:02:39.980> means<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.370> flip<00:02:40.640> covers<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.240> this

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
which means like flip covers and this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.940 
which means like flip covers and this
and<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.500> get<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.800> back

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
and that so if you do get the back

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.010 
and that so if you do get the back
scratched<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.670> easily<00:02:43.820> switch<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.930> over

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
scratched you can easily switch it over

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.380 
scratched you can easily switch it over
for<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> different<00:02:45.680> sort<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.980> casing<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.970> clips

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
for a different sort of casing it clips

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.210 
for a different sort of casing it clips
on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> back<00:02:47.810> there<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.680> nice<00:02:48.860> kind<00:02:49.070> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
on the back there in a nice kind of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.050 
on the back there in a nice kind of
setup<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.040> can<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.370> here<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.760> phone

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
setup as you can see here the phone

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.550 
setup as you can see here the phone
actually<00:02:53.390> fits<00:02:53.600> quite<00:02:53.750> comfortably<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.440> my

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
large display and the reality is also is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.180 
large display and the reality is also is
very<00:03:02.090> lightweight<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.870> much<00:03:03.590> lighter<00:03:03.860> than

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
very lightweight it's much lighter than
