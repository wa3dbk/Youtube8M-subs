00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
such a high level because I think this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.460 
such a high level because I think this
j-league<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.990> highest<00:01:56.260> level<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:57.369> Asia<00:01:58.470> so

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
had the ground disappears under your

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.280 
had the ground disappears under your
feet<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.640> was<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.669> black<00:04:30.970> hole<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:32.110> was

feet and was a black hole and it was

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.659 
feet and was a black hole and it was
also<00:04:33.010> pretty<00:04:33.340> bad<00:04:33.610> into<00:04:34.000> me<00:04:34.150> so

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669

also pretty bad into me so
but<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.270> think<00:04:36.509> after<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:37.259> injury<00:04:37.469> I<00:04:37.680> will<00:04:37.860> get

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.040 
but I think after this injury I will get
back<00:04:38.219> stronger<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:38.729> then<00:04:39.090> I'm<00:04:39.330> even<00:04:39.870> more

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050
