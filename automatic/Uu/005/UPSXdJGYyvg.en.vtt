 the ingredients and begin immediately with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.550
 the recipe first cut the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.550
 diced cheese 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.350
 a large and cut cheese a

 cubes we keep the ham as 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.880
 this in strips 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:21.310
 then in a container add a 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.310
 whole egg and two yolks 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 voila 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:58.320

 add the Greek yogurt which is 150 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.010
 grams then a whole landscape 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.230
 there may be even bigger jars 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.230
 this point 150 grams 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 8 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.689
 mix everything well 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:50.329
 salt as it rises a pinch a beautiful one 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:56.900
 handful a handful and a half e 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:03:00.680
 continue to mix at this point 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.440
 add the cheese and ham 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.019
 cooked that previously having cut to 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.409
 strips actually the chopped 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.250
 in short, I don't know if it ends up broken 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.760
 in short I made it spezzini and amalgamate 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.760
 all well 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.650
 we spread the puff pastry are 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:41.650
 ca pyrex with baking paper underneath 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:44.790
 prick with a fork at this 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.790
 stitch add to the dough 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.069
 flatten it well so it's nice 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.819
 uniform over the entire surface of the 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.819
 puff pastry 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.689
 bake at 200 degrees for about 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:13.269
 half an hour precisely the time depends on a 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.700
 from your oven, check it every 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.930
 so much our oven more or less 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.410
 half an hour and is a normal oven not ad 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.410
 air 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:54.980
 the cake is ready and is beautiful and 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.980
 very good 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.860
 then this is the end result not 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.569
 we cut it which was still a while 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.059
 lukewarm maybe it was better to wait 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.919
 yet another moment, however, another 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.619
 recipe that I've seen advice because 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.089
 in the end very simple super fast ed 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.409
 it's very good 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.079
