with<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.720> device

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
with the device

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640 
with the device
on<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> vehicle<00:02:14.240> itself<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
on the vehicle itself so this is the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.200 
on the vehicle itself so this is the
device<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:15.950> will<00:02:16.160> go<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.340> each<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.820> each<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
device that will go on each of each of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.480 
device that will go on each of each of
the<00:02:17.270> car<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.750> basically<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.800> you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the car so basically what this is is you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.480 
the car so basically what this is is you
would<00:02:19.730> swipe<00:02:19.940> your<00:02:20.120> ID<00:02:20.300> here<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.370> you're

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
going to pop out right out here now you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.370 
going to pop out right out here now you
take<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.360> out<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.630> road<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:26.960> test<00:02:27.170> drive
