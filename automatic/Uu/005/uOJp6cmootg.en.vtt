I<00:00:07.020> thought<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.800> was<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.950> bit<00:00:08.100> sad<00:00:08.370> actually<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
I thought it was a bit sad actually and

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.450 
I thought it was a bit sad actually and
a<00:00:09.330> bit<00:00:09.510> kind<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:09.930> like<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.590> dog<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.340> his

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
a bit kind of like like my dog with his

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.379 
a bit kind of like like my dog with his
tail<00:00:11.700> between<00:00:11.730> his<00:00:12.059> legs<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:13.940> Djokovic<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
tail between his legs and Djokovic and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.589 
tail between his legs and Djokovic and
Nadal<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.470> Federer<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.670> don't<00:00:17.970> sort<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
Nadal and Federer they don't sort of

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.780 
Nadal and Federer they don't sort of
sneak<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> competitions<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.580> way

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
sneak out of competitions in that way

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.060 
sneak out of competitions in that way
and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.540> just<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:21.840> Andy<00:00:22.200> you<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.800> who<00:00:22.950> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and I just think Andy you know who is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
and I just think Andy you know who is
the<00:00:23.189> most<00:00:23.369> phenomenal<00:00:23.790> player<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.599> know<00:00:24.720> he

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the most phenomenal player you know he

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.560 
the most phenomenal player you know he
still<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:26.040> of<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.399> not<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.610> most<00:00:26.970> exciting

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
still is one of if not the most exciting

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.999 
still is one of if not the most exciting
player<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.169> the<00:00:28.259> game<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.649> terms<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.919> the

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
player in the game in terms of the

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.429 
player in the game in terms of the
variety<00:00:29.220> shot<00:00:29.759> we<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.029> play<00:00:30.239> his<00:00:30.930> tactical

I<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.700> he<00:00:32.880> he<00:00:33.300> either<00:00:33.480> needs<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.020> get

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
I just think he he either needs to get

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990 
I just think he he either needs to get
him<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.920> strong<00:00:35.309> look<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.579> himself

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
him have a very strong look at himself

him have a very strong look at himself

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
who's gonna actually shake him up and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830 
who's gonna actually shake him up and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
you know but the clock is ticking if
he's<00:01:00.089> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.269> win<00:01:00.329> an<00:01:00.510> agent<00:01:00.839> I<00:01:04.129> like<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
he's going to win an agent I like to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
he's going to win an agent I like to
think<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
think so I really like to think so and I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.220 
think so I really like to think so and I
think<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> key<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.110> will

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
think the key thing but that will

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.289 
think the key thing but that will
determine<00:01:10.500> whether<00:01:10.800> he<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.909> really

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
determine whether he has a really really

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
determine whether he has a really really
big<00:01:12.509> chance<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> than<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.140> made<00:01:13.320> next<00:01:13.649> year<00:01:13.770> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
big chance to than he made next year or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.690 
big chance to than he made next year or
only<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.180> slight<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> who<00:01:16.649> he<00:01:16.890> decides<00:01:17.280> or

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
only a slight one is who he decides or

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
only a slight one is who he decides or
who<00:01:18.270> decides<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:20.189> coach<00:01:20.640> him<00:01:20.939> mentor

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
who decides to actually coach him mentor

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
who decides to actually coach him mentor
him<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:21.990> manage<00:01:22.590> him<00:01:22.829> whoever<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
him and manage him whoever that is I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
him and manage him whoever that is I
think<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> absolutely<00:01:24.960> key<00:01:25.200> Evan<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
think that's the absolutely key Evan you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.080 
think that's the absolutely key Evan you
saw<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.250> playing<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.579> Toronto<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
saw the way playing in Toronto and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
saw the way playing in Toronto and
elsewhere<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.079> sees<00:01:28.320> every<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
elsewhere you know he sees every bit the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.440 
elsewhere you know he sees every bit the
equal<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> best<00:01:29.880> players<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> world

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
equal of the best players in the world

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.590 
equal of the best players in the world
but<00:01:31.439> you've<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> best<00:01:32.759> you've<00:01:33.479> got

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
but you've got to be the best you've got

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
but you've got to be the best you've got
to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> best<00:01:34.020> time<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> time

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to be the best time and time and time

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
to be the best time and time and time
again<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.969> can't<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> flip<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
again you can't just flip in and out and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.630 
again you can't just flip in and out and
that's<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.579> he

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that's what you know that's what he

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.510 
that's what you know that's what he
can't<00:01:38.820> afford<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> do

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
can't afford to do

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.830 
can't afford to do
I<00:01:43.119> think<00:01:44.119> he's<00:01:44.270> not<00:01:44.450> quite<00:01:44.720> as

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
I think he's not quite as

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.539 
I think he's not quite as
straightforward<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.380> character<00:01:45.799> as<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.189> rapper

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
straightforward a character as as rapper

mean I think Andy is quite it's quite
it's<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.899> much<00:02:03.049> more<00:02:03.200> complex<00:02:03.649> character<00:02:04.189> much

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700

it's a much more complex character much
more<00:02:04.880> fiery<00:02:05.179> character<00:02:05.899> as<00:02:06.020> well<00:02:06.170> so

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
more fiery character as well so

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.960 
more fiery character as well so
obviously<00:02:06.770> perhaps<00:02:07.159> not<00:02:07.340> quite<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.580> easy<00:02:07.820> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
obviously perhaps not quite so easy to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.609 
obviously perhaps not quite so easy to
work<00:02:08.090> with<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.630> think<00:02:08.989> it's<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.229> very<00:02:09.470> very

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619
