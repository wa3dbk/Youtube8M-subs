 gai snow drifts asks drivers not 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.150

 snow removal equipment works 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.350
 past day roads of the republic 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.450
 cleared more than a thousand cars to 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.320
 cleaning recommends more actively engage and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.320
 residents themselves 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.299
 almost turn to citizens so that 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.970
 there are some places where not held 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.769
 cleaning so we owned in a timely manner 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.269
 information can be accessed at 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.709

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.890
 organizations have a hot telephone 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.630
 lines in every area have sites in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.610
 each area therefore this information 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.910
 if he takes away we will be very 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.950
 thankful in Belarus since 2013 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.290
 benefits for children under three years old 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.970
 will grow almost together the corresponding 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.220
 parliamentarians considered the bill 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.980
 today in the second reading he can 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.019
 from January 1, one of 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.329
 major innovations document changes 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.450
 mechanism for calculating monthly payments and 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.310
 their dependence on the order of birth 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.230
 so the size of childcare benefits in 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 under three years old will be tied to 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.680
 minimum subsistence budget 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.910
 a monthly average wage 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.000
 workers by country recalculation will be 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.940

 wages and pensions February 1 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.359
 so for now according to preliminary data 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.370
 means 35 percent if you take 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.790
 today's position it will be order 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.470
 million four hundred and forty percent is 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.260
 on the second and subsequent children this 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.120
 about million 600 thousand and on 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.280
 disabled child 45 percent is 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.900
 about a million 800 thousand 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.120
 Rosatom promises to fulfill obligations 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.859

 international norms and recommendations 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.739

 between rights agreements if Belarus 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.659

 the right to make a decision that is she 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.829

 last year's gala concert will remind 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.550
 rather bright colorful show 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.530
