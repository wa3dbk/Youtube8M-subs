right Deb in Elliot's place at bellevue

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
right Deb in Elliot's place at bellevue
hill<00:00:19.800> valera<00:00:20.800> and<00:00:20.890> we're<00:00:21.880> setting<00:00:22.150> up<00:00:22.210> an

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
hill valera and we're setting up an

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.510 
hill valera and we're setting up an
aquaponic<00:00:23.470> system<00:00:23.860> so<00:00:24.040> it's<00:00:24.160> part<00:00:24.369> of<00:00:24.430> a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
aquaponic system so it's part of a

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.830 
aquaponic system so it's part of a
bigger<00:00:24.700> project<00:00:24.970> where<00:00:25.420> we're<00:00:25.600> establishing

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
bigger project where we're establishing

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.590 
bigger project where we're establishing
a<00:00:26.230> sustainable<00:00:26.800> landscape<00:00:27.340> as<00:00:27.550> part<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.420> a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
a sustainable landscape as part of a

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.540 
a sustainable landscape as part of a
Cooper<00:00:29.380> Creek<00:00:29.590> project<00:00:29.770> so<00:00:30.130> we're<00:00:30.250> trying<00:00:30.370> to

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
Cooper Creek project so we're trying to

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.490 
Cooper Creek project so we're trying to
enhance<00:00:30.850> Cooper<00:00:31.660> Creek<00:00:31.930> which<00:00:32.110> is<00:00:32.230> part<00:00:32.440> of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
enhance Cooper Creek which is part of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.430 
enhance Cooper Creek which is part of
the<00:00:32.620> Sydney<00:00:32.920> Harbour<00:00:32.950> catchment<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.690> this<00:00:35.230> is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the Sydney Harbour catchment and this is

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.100 
the Sydney Harbour catchment and this is
a<00:00:35.470> little<00:00:35.890> part<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:37.989> is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
a little part of doing that so this is

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.350 
a little part of doing that so this is
an<00:00:38.199> aquaponics<00:00:38.770> setup

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.950 

nah

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
nah

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:55.630 
nah
Oh

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.340 

what<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.300> we<00:00:56.329> got<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:56.570> we've<00:00:56.840> set<00:00:57.020> up<00:00:57.050> a

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
what do we got here we've set up a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.410 
what do we got here we've set up a
really<00:00:57.770> basic<00:00:58.010> aquaponic<00:00:58.700> system<00:00:59.059> we've<00:00:59.270> got

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
really basic aquaponic system we've got

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.580 
really basic aquaponic system we've got
the<00:00:59.540> tank<00:00:59.800> we've<00:01:00.800> got<00:01:00.920> our<00:01:00.950> five<00:01:01.540> goldfish

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
the tank we've got our five goldfish

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.500 
the tank we've got our five goldfish
which<00:01:03.590> are<00:01:03.739> going<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.150> establish<00:01:05.150> the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
which are going to establish the

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.240 
which are going to establish the
equilibrium<00:01:06.020> they're<00:01:06.170> going<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.350> add<00:01:06.500> add<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
equilibrium they're going to add add the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.719 
equilibrium they're going to add add the
ammonia<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.020> fish<00:01:09.200> poo<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.610> new

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
ammonia and the the fish poo and the new

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.440 
ammonia and the the fish poo and the new
chance<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.330> system<00:01:11.720> we've<00:01:12.560> got<00:01:12.770> our<00:01:12.800> pump

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
chance to the system we've got our pump

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.350 
chance to the system we've got our pump
which<00:01:14.450> comes<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.020> for<00:01:15.320> 50<00:01:16.130> seconds<00:01:16.610> every<00:01:17.180> hour

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
which comes on for 50 seconds every hour

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.920 
which comes on for 50 seconds every hour
so<00:01:18.100> we've<00:01:19.100> got<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> timer<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.630> power

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
so we've got a timer on the on the power

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.320 
so we've got a timer on the on the power
outlet<00:01:21.650> there<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.610> that'll<00:01:22.850> pump<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.150> dirty

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
outlet there so that'll pump the dirty

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.600 
outlet there so that'll pump the dirty
water<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.900> into<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.259> grow<00:01:24.440> bed<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> grow

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
water up into the grow bed now the grow

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.370 
water up into the grow bed now the grow
bed<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.270> we've<00:01:27.200> used<00:01:27.409> expanded<00:01:28.070> clay<00:01:29.380> which

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
bed is we've used expanded clay which

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.870 
bed is we've used expanded clay which
has<00:01:30.590> lots<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.920> surface<00:01:31.280> area<00:01:31.580> for<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
has lots of surface area for the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.969 
has lots of surface area for the
bacteria<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.600> grow<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.289> bacteria<00:01:33.890> are

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
bacteria to grow in so bacteria are

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.770 
bacteria to grow in so bacteria are
going<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> live<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.610> system<00:01:34.820> they're

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
going to live in this system they're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.940 
going to live in this system they're
going<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.050> take<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.320> nutrients<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to take the nutrients in the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.889 
going to take the nutrients in the
ammonia<00:01:37.310> out<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.970> water<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.509> convert<00:01:38.869> it

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
ammonia out of the water and convert it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.050 
ammonia out of the water and convert it
into<00:01:39.259> fish<00:01:39.680> into<00:01:40.280> plant<00:01:40.520> food<00:01:41.770> they're

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
into fish into plant food they're

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.190 
into fish into plant food they're
feeding<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.270> plants<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.810> cleaning<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
feeding the plants and cleaning the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
feeding the plants and cleaning the
water<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.320> flood<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:49.009> an

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
water so it's a it's a flood it's an

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.169 
water so it's a it's a flood it's an
it's<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.869> what<00:01:50.869> do<00:01:50.929> we<00:01:51.020> call<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:52.000> flood<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's a what do we call it a flood and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.310 
it's a what do we call it a flood and
drain<00:01:53.360> system<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.490> pump<00:01:55.810> basically<00:01:56.810> fills

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
drain system so the pump basically fills

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.020 
drain system so the pump basically fills
the<00:01:57.470> bed<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:57.770> with<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.100> nutrient-rich<00:01:58.670> water

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the bed up with the nutrient-rich water

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.929 
the bed up with the nutrient-rich water
and<00:01:59.360> then<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.470> drained<00:02:00.710> slowly<00:02:01.280> through<00:02:01.820> this

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
and then it drained slowly through this

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.859 
and then it drained slowly through this
drain<00:02:02.360> hole<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.890> back<00:02:03.890> out<00:02:04.119> into<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.360> into

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
drain hole and back out into the into

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.020 
drain hole and back out into the into
the<00:02:05.960> pond<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.799> it's<00:02:06.979> basically<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.549> gravity

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the pond so it's basically a gravity

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.400 
the pond so it's basically a gravity
system<00:02:08.269> once<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.720> gets<00:02:08.869> pumped<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.229> here

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
system once it gets pumped up here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.530 
system once it gets pumped up here
gravity<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.009> flows<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.729> flows<00:02:11.060> back<00:02:11.299> down

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
gravity just flows it flows back down

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.210 
gravity just flows it flows back down
the<00:02:12.320> pump<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.769> 250<00:02:13.730> watts<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.980> given<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.010> it's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the pump is 250 watts so given that it's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.509 
the pump is 250 watts so given that it's
only<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.579> on<00:02:16.820> for<00:02:17.120> 8<00:02:17.329> or<00:02:17.950> 24<00:02:18.950> minutes<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.340> day

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
only going on for 8 or 24 minutes a day

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.420 
only going on for 8 or 24 minutes a day
it's<00:02:20.000> pretty<00:02:20.239> energy-efficient<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.950> aerator

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's pretty energy-efficient the aerator

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.699 
it's pretty energy-efficient the aerator
needs<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.299> be<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.720> time<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> thing

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
needs to be on all the time so the thing

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.259 
needs to be on all the time so the thing
that<00:02:24.829> makes<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> bubbles<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.000> water

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
that makes the bubbles because the water

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.759 
that makes the bubbles because the water
needs<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:26.900> lots<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.200> oxygen<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.709> it

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
needs to have lots of oxygen in it

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.680 
needs to have lots of oxygen in it
otherwise<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> fish<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:29.299> fish<00:02:29.329> will<00:02:29.660> die

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
otherwise a fish the fish will die

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
otherwise a fish the fish will die
basically<00:02:30.380> they<00:02:30.530> need<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> very<00:02:31.130> oxygen-rich

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
basically they need a very oxygen-rich

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.710 
basically they need a very oxygen-rich
environment<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:33.970> after<00:02:34.970> two<00:02:35.540> or<00:02:35.570> three

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
environment and after two or three

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.020 
environment and after two or three
months<00:02:35.920> with<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> fish<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.430> there<00:02:37.640> just

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
months with the fish in there just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.750 
months with the fish in there just
feeding<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.450> fish<00:02:39.160> bacteria<00:02:40.160> will<00:02:40.370> start<00:02:40.640> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
feeding the fish bacteria will start to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.090 
feeding the fish bacteria will start to
grow<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.120> these<00:02:41.299> rocks<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:41.989> system<00:02:42.920> will

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
grow on these rocks and the system will

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.330 
grow on these rocks and the system will
become<00:02:43.480> stable<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.810> quite<00:02:45.280> sort<00:02:46.280> of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
become stable and quite sort of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.190 
become stable and quite sort of
self-sustaining<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.269> all<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.720> do<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.900> feed

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
self-sustaining and all you do is feed

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.229 
self-sustaining and all you do is feed
the<00:02:48.320> fish<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.799> fish<00:02:49.549> feed<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> plants

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
the fish and the fish feed the plants

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.610 
the fish and the fish feed the plants
and<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.420> plants<00:02:50.450> clean<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.049> water<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and the plants clean the water for the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.349 
and the plants clean the water for the
the<00:02:52.160> fish<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.900> stream<00:02:54.650> where<00:02:55.359> with

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
the fish it's like a stream where with

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.880 
the fish it's like a stream where with
the<00:02:56.450> reed<00:02:56.630> bed<00:02:56.870> you've<00:02:57.170> got<00:02:57.350> all<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> plants

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
the reed bed you've got all the plants

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.170 
the reed bed you've got all the plants
down<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> side<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.640> stream<00:02:58.910> they're

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
down the side of the stream they're

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.110 
down the side of the stream they're
basically<00:02:59.600> cleaning<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.140> water<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
basically cleaning the water for for the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.030 
basically cleaning the water for for the
fish<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.840> system<00:03:03.230> that's<00:03:03.380> closed<00:03:03.709> but

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
fish so it's a system that's closed but

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.830 
fish so it's a system that's closed but
it's<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.310> equilibrium<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.269> it's<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.629> based

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
it's in equilibrium and it's it's based

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.530 
it's in equilibrium and it's it's based
on<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.050> natural<00:03:06.590> natural<00:03:07.310> stream<00:03:07.819> ecosystem

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
on a natural natural stream ecosystem

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.010 
on a natural natural stream ecosystem
and

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.500 
and
really<00:03:09.260> productive<00:03:09.530> yeah<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.670> 1500<00:03:11.060> litre

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
really productive yeah so 1500 litre

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.530 
really productive yeah so 1500 litre
pond<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.080> we've<00:03:12.290> only<00:03:12.380> got<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> 200<00:03:13.220> litre<00:03:13.540> grow

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
pond and we've only got a 200 litre grow

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.040 
pond and we've only got a 200 litre grow
bed<00:03:14.750> ok<00:03:15.740> so<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:16.220> 1500<00:03:17.120> litre<00:03:17.360> pond<00:03:17.600> we<00:03:17.840> could

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
bed ok so for 1500 litre pond we could

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.150 
bed ok so for 1500 litre pond we could
have<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:19.340> maximize<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.330> output<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.690> fish

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
have to maximize the output of fish

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.050 
have to maximize the output of fish
maximize<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.280> number<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.580> fish<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:22.760> could

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
maximize the number of fish we could

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.880 
maximize the number of fish we could
have<00:03:23.210> a<00:03:23.240> three<00:03:23.720> thousand<00:03:24.200> liters<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.680> grow

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
have a three thousand liters of grow

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.610 
have a three thousand liters of grow
beds<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.490> can<00:03:25.640> have<00:03:25.850> 15<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.660> those<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
beds so we can have 15 of those the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.960 
beds so we can have 15 of those the
beauty<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.100> system<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.820> keep

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
beauty of this system is you can keep

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.900 
beauty of this system is you can keep
adding<00:03:29.180> grow<00:03:29.630> beds<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.200> go<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:31.550> if<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.730> did

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
adding grow beds as you go so if you did

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.520 
adding grow beds as you go so if you did
get<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> get<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.510> hang<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.900> with<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> few<00:03:33.290> fish

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
get a get the hang of it with a few fish

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.440 
get a get the hang of it with a few fish
and<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.130> wanted<00:03:34.400> more<00:03:34.520> just<00:03:34.970> add<00:03:35.090> more<00:03:35.270> grow

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
and you wanted more just add more grow

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.230 
and you wanted more just add more grow
beds<00:03:35.720> add<00:03:35.990> more<00:03:36.230> fish<00:03:36.500> at<00:03:37.370> 1000<00:03:37.940> litres<00:03:38.210> of

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
beds add more fish at 1000 litres of

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.500 
beds add more fish at 1000 litres of
water<00:03:38.830> will<00:03:39.830> grow<00:03:40.040> approximately<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.330> hundred

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
water will grow approximately a hundred

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.040 
water will grow approximately a hundred
at<00:03:41.950> maximum<00:03:42.950> capacity<00:03:42.980> 100<00:03:43.760> kilos<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.420> fish<00:03:44.750> in

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
at maximum capacity 100 kilos of fish in

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.950 
at maximum capacity 100 kilos of fish in
a<00:03:45.140> year<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.160> could<00:03:46.310> grow<00:03:46.540> 150<00:03:47.540> kilos<00:03:47.930> of

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
a year so we could grow 150 kilos of

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.550 
a year so we could grow 150 kilos of
fish<00:03:48.260> with<00:03:49.130> 15<00:03:49.880> grow<00:03:50.120> beds<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:50.840> one<00:03:51.080> grow<00:03:51.320> bed

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
fish with 15 grow beds so one grow bed

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.460 
fish with 15 grow beds so one grow bed
you<00:03:51.710> grow<00:03:51.890> 15<00:03:52.400> kilos<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:52.880> fish<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:54.140> fish<00:03:54.320> is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
you grow 15 kilos of fish and a fish is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.490 
you grow 15 kilos of fish and a fish is
about<00:03:54.770> anywhere<00:03:55.370> between<00:03:55.580> 500<00:03:56.110> grams<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
about anywhere between 500 grams and a

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.550 
about anywhere between 500 grams and a
kilo<00:03:57.830> say<00:03:58.130> 15<00:03:59.030> fish<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.420> year<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.810> for<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.530> to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
kilo say 15 fish a year and for it to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.980 
kilo say 15 fish a year and for it to
kick<00:04:00.830> in<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.460> can<00:04:01.700> take<00:04:01.910> up<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.180> about<00:04:02.450> 3<00:04:02.810> months

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
kick in it can take up to about 3 months

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.290 
kick in it can take up to about 3 months
for<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.830> system<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> find<00:04:04.550> its<00:04:04.700> balance<00:04:04.760> so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
for the system to find its balance so

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.650 
for the system to find its balance so
for<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.630> bacteria<00:04:06.140> levels<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.590> grow<00:04:07.510> for<00:04:08.510> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
for the bacteria levels to grow for the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.470 
for the bacteria levels to grow for the
fish<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.930> produce<00:04:09.320> enough<00:04:10.190> nutrients<00:04:10.790> for<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
fish to produce enough nutrients for the

fish to produce enough nutrients for the
bacteria<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.080> grow<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.459> know<00:04:13.580> can<00:04:13.820> Evan

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
bacteria to grow so you know can Evan

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.580 
bacteria to grow so you know can Evan
flow<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.300> little<00:04:14.510> bit<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:14.900> three<00:04:15.290> months

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
flow a little bit in that three months

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.110 
flow a little bit in that three months
you<00:04:15.680> might<00:04:15.830> get<00:04:16.040> some<00:04:16.190> algae<00:04:16.549> growing<00:04:16.790> it

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
you might get some algae growing it

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880 
you might get some algae growing it
might<00:04:17.270> not<00:04:17.420> be<00:04:17.510> as<00:04:17.600> productive<00:04:17.780> as<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.739> could

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
might not be as productive as it could

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.130 
might not be as productive as it could
be<00:04:18.920> but<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.670> three<00:04:19.910> months<00:04:20.030> time<00:04:20.180> these<00:04:20.810> plants

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
be but in three months time these plants

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.440 
be but in three months time these plants
are<00:04:21.380> going<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.430> be<00:04:22.580> going<00:04:22.730> gangbusters<00:04:23.030> and

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
are going to be going gangbusters and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.420 
are going to be going gangbusters and
growing<00:04:23.810> really<00:04:23.960> well<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:24.950> set<00:04:25.220> up<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
growing really well so to set up a

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.150 
growing really well so to set up a
system<00:04:25.610> like<00:04:25.880> this<00:04:26.060> we've<00:04:26.570> just<00:04:26.810> finished

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
system like this we've just finished

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.130 
system like this we've just finished
actually<00:04:28.160> setting<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.610> up<00:04:28.730> in<00:04:28.970> about<00:04:29.780> four

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
actually setting it up in about four

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.830 
actually setting it up in about four
hours<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.760> was<00:04:31.910> pretty<00:04:32.060> pretty<00:04:32.450> simple

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
hours so it was pretty pretty simple

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.060 
hours so it was pretty pretty simple
once<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.140> got<00:04:33.260> all<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.410> bits<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.800> pieces

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
once we got all the bits and pieces

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.070 
once we got all the bits and pieces
together<00:04:34.220> really<00:04:34.910> quick<00:04:35.240> really<00:04:35.420> easy<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.900> set

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
together really quick really easy to set

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.260 
together really quick really easy to set
up<00:04:36.110> lots<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.160> running<00:04:37.490> around<00:04:37.640> trying<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.120> find

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
up lots of running around trying to find

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.400 
up lots of running around trying to find
all<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.570> bits<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.840> pieces<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.200> first

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
all the bits and pieces in the first

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.190 
all the bits and pieces in the first
place<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:41.660> know<00:04:41.750> we've<00:04:41.870> got<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> lot<00:04:42.170> of

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
place but you know we've got a lot of

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.900 
place but you know we've got a lot of
finishing<00:04:42.650> off<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.890> do<00:04:43.010> aesthetically<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:43.850> a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
finishing off to do aesthetically it's a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.310 
finishing off to do aesthetically it's a
little<00:04:44.090> bit<00:04:44.210> challenged<00:04:44.630> at<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.870> moment<00:04:45.200> but

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
little bit challenged at the moment but

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.990 
little bit challenged at the moment but
we<00:04:45.440> can<00:04:45.590> put<00:04:45.770> we'll<00:04:46.040> put<00:04:46.190> some<00:04:46.370> timber<00:04:46.730> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
we can put we'll put some timber and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.640 
we can put we'll put some timber and
some<00:04:47.240> will<00:04:47.780> get<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:48.020> looking<00:04:48.230> really<00:04:48.500> nice

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
some will get it looking really nice

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.350 
some will get it looking really nice
it's<00:04:48.950> probably<00:04:49.280> another<00:04:49.460> day's<00:04:49.730> work<00:04:50.030> in<00:04:50.240> it

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
it's probably another day's work in it

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.990 
it's probably another day's work in it
so<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:51.350> know<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> day<00:04:51.890> maybe<00:04:52.250> two<00:04:52.370> days<00:04:52.550> at<00:04:52.910> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
so you know a day maybe two days at the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.310 
so you know a day maybe two days at the
most<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.330> can<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.930> set<00:04:54.110> up<00:04:54.200> your

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
most you can you can set up your

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.439 
most you can you can set up your
aquaponic<00:04:54.860> system

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
aquaponic system

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:08.150 
aquaponic system
Oh

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.920 

alright<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> nutshell<00:05:09.300> that's<00:05:09.660> how<00:05:09.870> to

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
alright so in a nutshell that's how to

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.480 
alright so in a nutshell that's how to
install<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.350> really<00:05:11.070> quite<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.280> simple

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
install a really quite a simple

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.290 
install a really quite a simple
aquaponic<00:05:12.240> system<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.880> as<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> bit<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.240> a

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
aquaponic system just as a bit of a

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.610 
aquaponic system just as a bit of a
checklist<00:05:15.540> for<00:05:15.810> maintenance<00:05:16.140> you<00:05:16.410> want<00:05:16.560> to

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
checklist for maintenance you want to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.380 
checklist for maintenance you want to
make<00:05:16.740> sure<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.250> bubble<00:05:17.670> machine<00:05:18.240> is

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
make sure that that bubble machine is

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.450 
make sure that that bubble machine is
going<00:05:18.660> all<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.960> time<00:05:18.990> if<00:05:19.710> that<00:05:19.770> turns<00:05:20.100> off<00:05:20.310> you

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
going all the time if that turns off you

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.210 
going all the time if that turns off you
can<00:05:20.610> lose<00:05:20.790> your<00:05:20.820> fish<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:22.530> want<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.860> check

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
can lose your fish you want to check

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.580 
can lose your fish you want to check
that<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.640> pump<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.030> working<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.630> it's<00:05:25.410> going

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
that the pump is working and it's going

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.380 
that the pump is working and it's going
on<00:05:25.800> at<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.010> regular<00:05:26.280> intervals<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:27.090> are

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
on at the regular intervals that are

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.050 
on at the regular intervals that are
programmed<00:05:27.870> into<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.260> timer<00:05:28.820> just<00:05:29.820> keep<00:05:29.970> an

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
programmed into that timer just keep an

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.500 
programmed into that timer just keep an
eye<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.330> plants<00:05:30.660> if<00:05:30.870> they're<00:05:31.080> going<00:05:31.230> ok

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
eye on the plants if they're going ok

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.270 
eye on the plants if they're going ok
there<00:05:33.510> are<00:05:33.660> certain<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.560> can<00:05:34.680> test<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.070> water

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
there are certain you can test the water

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280 
there are certain you can test the water
using<00:05:36.120> water<00:05:36.330> testing<00:05:36.750> kits<00:05:36.930> you're<00:05:37.080> looking

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
using water testing kits you're looking

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.640 
using water testing kits you're looking
for<00:05:37.470> pH<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.070> all<00:05:38.490> those<00:05:38.640> sorts<00:05:38.970> of<00:05:39.030> things<00:05:39.650> and

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
for pH and all those sorts of things and

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.670 
for pH and all those sorts of things and
just<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:42.240> want<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.630> test<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:43.020> make<00:05:43.230> sure<00:05:43.350> that

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
just you want to test to make sure that

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.020 
just you want to test to make sure that
the<00:05:43.770> pond<00:05:43.920> does<00:05:44.070> an<00:05:44.160> empty<00:05:44.370> itself<00:05:44.640> so<00:05:44.910> if

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
the pond does an empty itself so if

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.850 
the pond does an empty itself so if
we've<00:05:45.270> checked<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:45.870> there<00:05:46.110> are<00:05:46.230> no<00:05:46.320> leaks<00:05:46.590> in

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
we've checked that there are no leaks in

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.700 
we've checked that there are no leaks in
the<00:05:47.010> system<00:05:47.160> anywhere<00:05:48.350> because<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.530> last

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
the system anywhere because the last

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.170 
the system anywhere because the last
thing<00:05:49.830> obviously<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.520> want<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.760> do<00:05:50.880> is<00:05:51.030> when

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
thing obviously you want to do is when

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.760 
thing obviously you want to do is when
the<00:05:51.300> pump<00:05:51.450> comes<00:05:51.720> on<00:05:51.900> if<00:05:52.080> there's<00:05:52.290> a<00:05:52.350> leak<00:05:52.590> we

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
the pump comes on if there's a leak we

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.950 
the pump comes on if there's a leak we
can<00:05:52.920> empty<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.250> pond<00:05:53.460> eventually<00:05:54.000> so<00:05:54.330> it's

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
can empty the pond eventually so it's

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.360 
can empty the pond eventually so it's
really<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.290> keeping<00:05:55.650> an<00:05:55.770> eye<00:05:55.860> on<00:05:55.890> it<00:05:56.160> making

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
really just keeping an eye on it making

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.220 
really just keeping an eye on it making
sure<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> fish<00:05:56.910> are<00:05:57.090> healthy<00:05:57.420> they're<00:05:58.110> not

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
sure the fish are healthy they're not

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.830 
sure the fish are healthy they're not
sort<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.530> floating<00:05:58.890> upside<00:05:59.010> down<00:05:59.460> underneath

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
sort of floating upside down underneath
