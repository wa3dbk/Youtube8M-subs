00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
untethered so this is a big deal because

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.510 
untethered so this is a big deal because
this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:53.880> untethered<00:00:54.719> jailbreak

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
this is the first untethered jailbreak

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.440 
this is the first untethered jailbreak
for<00:00:56.520> iOS<00:00:57.000> 5<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.170> other<00:00:58.680> versions<00:00:59.040> are

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
for iOS 5 all the other versions are

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.860 
for iOS 5 all the other versions are
tethered<00:01:00.450> which<00:01:01.050> means<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
tethered which means that you have to

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.169 
tethered which means that you have to
connect<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.369> iPhone<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.939> pc<00:01:08.939> or

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
connect your iPhone to the pc or

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.779 
connect your iPhone to the pc or
macintosh<00:01:09.539> if<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.439> power<00:01:10.649> down<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.249> reboot<00:01:11.609> it

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
macintosh if you power down to reboot it

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.389 
macintosh if you power down to reboot it
so<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.719> won't<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> reboot<00:01:13.649> our<00:01:13.889> Apple

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
so now we won't have to reboot our Apple

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.139 
so now we won't have to reboot our Apple
devices<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.149> they<00:01:15.840> power<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> first

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
devices if they power down so the first

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.090 
devices if they power down so the first
thing<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.659> should<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:19.079> is<00:01:19.109> check<00:01:19.829> in<00:01:19.859> your

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
thing you should do is check in your

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.059 
thing you should do is check in your
settings<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:22.139> to<00:01:22.200> general<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:22.859> you

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
settings and go down to general then you

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.609 
settings and go down to general then you
go<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.219> about<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.899> then<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.109> should<00:01:25.289> go<00:01:25.319> down

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
go to about and then you should go down

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
go to about and then you should go down
and<00:01:25.829> look<00:01:26.249> to<00:01:26.700> make<00:01:26.850> sure<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.209> you're<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and look to make sure that you're in

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
and look to make sure that you're in
five<00:01:27.779> point<00:01:28.109> zero<00:01:28.350> point<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.389> you<00:01:30.479> see

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
five point zero point one so if you see

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
five point zero point one so if you see
right<00:01:30.779> here<00:01:30.929> this<00:01:31.109> version<00:01:31.529> is<00:01:31.560> five<00:01:31.740> point<00:01:32.039> O

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right here this version is five point O

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.469 
right here this version is five point O
so<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.700> we're<00:01:32.849> going<00:01:32.999> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.179> is<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.389> going

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.419 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:33.539> update<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.560> latest<00:01:34.740> version<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
to update it to the latest version and

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.639 
to update it to the latest version and
then<00:01:35.999> we're<00:01:36.569> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.719> use<00:01:36.869> redsnow<00:01:37.319> to

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
then we're going to use redsnow to

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.899 
then we're going to use redsnow to
jailbreak<00:01:38.099> it<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.399> your<00:01:39.329> phone<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.909> unlocked

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
jailbreak it if your phone is unlocked

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.749 
jailbreak it if your phone is unlocked
and<00:01:42.329> you're<00:01:42.959> using<00:01:43.200> t-mobile<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.609> other

and you're using t-mobile or some other
carrier<00:01:45.179> you<00:01:45.990> should<00:01:46.969> hold<00:01:47.969> out<00:01:48.419> on<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:49.049> doing

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
carrier you should hold out on on doing

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.899 
carrier you should hold out on on doing
it<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.099> way<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.429> you're<00:01:50.609> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.819> have

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to hold that baseband that you have so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.909 
to hold that baseband that you have so
that<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.729> doesn't<00:01:56.909> lock<00:01:57.209> you<00:01:57.419> up<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.169> you're

00:01:58.909 --> 00:01:58.919
