minecraft episodes up tomorrow or and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
minecraft episodes up tomorrow or and
not<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.449> already<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.810> 830<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> live

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.339 
not it's already like 830 where I live
so<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> pointless<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.869> upload<00:00:31.140> right

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so be kind of pointless to upload right

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
so be kind of pointless to upload right
now<00:00:32.000> because<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.270> videos<00:00:33.809> don't<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.230> very<00:00:34.350> good

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
now because my videos don't do very good

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.810 
now because my videos don't do very good
