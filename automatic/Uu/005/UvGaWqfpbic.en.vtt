00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.740
 to me from a very good point of view 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.900
 nights what a pleasure to greet you this 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.339
 Wednesday so soon in the middle of the week 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.049
 let's start with the information the 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.539
 thermometer at the moment is indicating us 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.759
 a temperature of 24 degrees centigrade 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.619
 and same thermal sensation humidity 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.150
 relative of 89 percent and point of 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.890
 dew 22 degrees 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.900
 the surf this moment is very 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.119
 stable with a height of 2 to 3 feet and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 the port is open to everything 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.689
 type of navigation and we are registering 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.210
 also southeasterly component winds 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.159
 a speed of 19 kilometers per hour 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.350
 we continue with the surada all day of 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.750
 today it has continued to register throughout 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.940
 of the gulf of mexico that's why 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
 we have this storm that for nothing 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.449
 it was predicted we had a 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.609
 pretty precipitation probability 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.170
 low that went from 5 to 7 percent 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.750
 let's say not a 10 percent then 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.760
 it sounds pretty low and in a way 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.219
 quite illogical that those 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.170
 precipitation but the truth things 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.120
 they change in a second as to the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.300
 weather conditions that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.920
 we have a pretty stable pressure thousand 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.030
 12,000 and bars I do not guarantee stable 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.460
 for tomorrow night 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 we know that the previous morning that the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.360
 front system number 43 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.160
 a little bit down the pressure values 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.440
 and suddenly they tend to rise from a 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000
 way that we can be scared a bit 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.160
 sunrise for the day tomorrow 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.400
 we have at 6 with 30 minutes and put 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.350
 of sun 18 hours with 44 minutes let's see the 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.090
 next image to comment everything in 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.470
 matter of national territory I have 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 good news the front system 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.479
 number 42 of the season finally no longer 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.790
 we see it on our map already dissipated and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.740
 we do not have anything in the gulf of mexico what 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.380
 that he did leave if you remember the day of 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.240
 yesterday there was presence of two high 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.970
 pressures and when there are two highs 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.430
 pressures can sometimes arise changes 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.500
 as in this memory also yesterday 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.690
 I told him about the presence of a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.940
 line of trough in the gulf of mexico 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.880
 in the southern portion of the gulf of mexico 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.740
 then that gave rise to the event of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 surada that we have been recording as 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.119
 long today and we knew that 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 we had rainfall conditions 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.200
 and storms in veracruz in tabasco in 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.820
 entities of the center to potential 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.399
 hail that is still in the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.649
 next 24 hours then that's those 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.019
 rainfall and those storms do not the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.030
 the surada went up that's why we had 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.439
 these storm effects we have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.730
 now a little agility in terms of 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.530
 wind thing that was also not 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.030
 predestined and things that are going to change 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 still for tomorrow you are 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 things are let's say just a little 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.189
 by the event of surada things are going to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.109
 be somewhat stable for the day of 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.970
 tomorrow but again there is a change 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.970
 already for tomorrow night and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.049
 first hours of the day Friday flipping 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.849
 towards this side I have something very 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.709
 important to comment we have 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.530
 still an area in stability that already 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.879
 went up to the south of the American union 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.220
 this north of chihuahua and coahuila 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.319
 over the limits generating still 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.510
 wind that reaches gusts of these 50 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.879
 kilometers per hour and rainfall in 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.950
 these two entities things that are going to 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.359
 change for the following a new 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.950
 frontal system we already came 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.409
 talking since we started this 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.970
 week the number 43 of the season already 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.280
 we have extended it here still in the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.349
 south of the american union and this for 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 the next few hours, he hopes that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.159
 locate and extend for the day of 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.569
 specifically tomorrow I already believe in 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.150
 early hours of the morning and we'll 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.680
 to start registering on our map to 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.780
 throughout the entire portion I do not 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.490
 northeast and north of the Mexican soil 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.160
 exactly from where 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.230
 extend from the northeast of the USA going 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.390
 to take part of the north of our 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.490
 been up chihuahua is the system 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.320
 frontal will cover part of the northeast and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.450
 north of national territory and it is expected 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.280
 that as you move quickly is 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.620
 the gulf of mexico already for the day 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 Friday is covering part of the gulf 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.090
 of mexico and reaching also the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.590
 Yucatan peninsula on this same side 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.140
 that will generate the frontal system 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.940
 number 43 of the season we know well 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.470
 a drop in thermometers 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.510
 again here in the south of tamaulipas 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.910
 we do not have to scare much 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.520
 minimum values ​​that reach 16 and 17 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.710
 degrees centigrade and only that now that 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.360
 more will change we know well that elevates 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.160
 the probability of rainfall in 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.990
 all the entities of the north table 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.570
 accompanied by thunderstorms 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.340
 potential for hail in high areas of 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.530
 these same entities effects that 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.120
 they will extend to the entities of the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.830
 center where they still record it for 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.810
 tomorrow the potential for hail 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.910
 accompanied by rainfall by the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.830
 moisture income that is part of 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.940
 from the Pacific 'into the interior of the 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.500
 Mexican Republic 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.209
 we see stream in a lot 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 instability and much of the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.270
 national territory are going to be 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.090
 recording rainfall 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.860
 talk about the 43rd front that's going to 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.349
 generate we know well wind that reaches 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.840
 gusts of 50 and 60 kilometers per hour in 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.940
 the north table and northern event 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.900
 eye on the shores of Tamaulipas and 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.530
 veracruz with gusts that reach 75 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.240
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.069
 those changes regarding the event of 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.539
 'north' is expected to start at 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.330
 register is tomorrow afternoon 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.400
 night and the decline is coming 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.470
 moment begins to register and the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.060
 first hours of the day Friday you can 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.849
 start to cool tomorrow and the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.039
 night but low reaching 16 17 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.110
 degrees throughout the day Friday 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.819
 partial cloudy conditions and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.550
 total we know well that portion 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.830
 northeast as well as we can not 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.750
 rule out the presence of rains though 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.000
 we have a very low probability of 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.949
 they must consider the effects of 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.330
 frontal system number 43 because when 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.120
 we had started talking this week 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.219
 from front 43 has made us several 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.199
 plays was presented as a front 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.330
 pretty weak right now we see that no 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.310
 because as it spreads it extends 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.250
 towards the south of the gulf of mexico goes to 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.700
 overcome the 75- kilometer gusts in 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.920
 the area 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.510
 same and gulf of tehuantepec then yes 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.250
 the event of 'north' comes somewhat strong 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.410
 as for this frontal system 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.960
 conditions of significant decline 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.300
 let's say it this way cloudy 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.640
 and hail rainfall in high areas 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.380
 it also can not be ruled out by this 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.210
 same side we still see high income from 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.800
 humidity on the part of the Pacific ' we see the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.810
 jet stream if we see the image 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.430
 of satellite we will be able to appreciate with more 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.560
 detail how is it is moving 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.660
 all this humidity and also the changes 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.220
 of the front system number 43 still what 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.840
 we see part of the southern part of the 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.460
 American union looks in a very 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.590
 small in this part still comes 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.090
 accompanied by low pressures this 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.910
 is moving and already for the day of 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.070
 tomorrow I reiterate part from our 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.930
 been in the northern part until the 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.100
 chihuahua up here the first part of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.900
 the information we wait for more 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.430
 details in the second section of the 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.140
 weather forecast and fire me 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.090
 Thankful as my people do every night and 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.460
 sponsorship you already know that if 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.240
 you want and everything the monkey finds my 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.240
 large boutique
