00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.120
 temperature detection with the 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.110
 third pole 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.110
 infrared thermometer 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.039
 to turn it on one of the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 any buttons and you see the wording 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.730
 at this point we proceed to the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.530
 calibration by pushing cousin and smiley face 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.640
 together the word cane is highlighted 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.760
 a door opens and you take the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 target disk and calibration is performed 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.580
 gives off two beams of light they must 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.159
 converge in a single point forming a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.309
 perfect bottom 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.759
 at this point it is ready to detect the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.310
 temperature is very important to perform 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.530
 this maneuver was within the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.360
 in the patient because the thermometer of the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 first detect it temperatures 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.409
 environment is controlled the front of the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 parties that are not associated also not 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 is covered by hair and that it is that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 whether he has a clean skin or not 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.460
 be touched in the case of women yes 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 pushes the smiley button while holding down 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.179
 always approaches on the forehead doing 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.710
 with green for the two lines in one 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:53.039
 dot it leaves blinks and detects the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.619
 temperature at this point if in the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.869
 the patient's room should be measured 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.560
 temperature also through others 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.539
 patients 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 no need to run the 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.479
 calibration the calibration must be done 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.829
 only when leaving the room e 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.829
 you enter another room
