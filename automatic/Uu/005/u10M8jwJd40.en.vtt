 I always say it's the best car for me. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.330
 It's not to show because it has two colors. 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.560
 it is not the car of a single car of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.329

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.210

 verdi lima moleque had seen that car there 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.900
 It hurts my eye, it's too sharp that I 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.090
 I said go away and go back to the wheel or I 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.960
 whiting out front just let it all 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.370

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.500
 thing that got nicer than it is like 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.970
 row who came already out culture 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.889
 differentiated is connected in what I am 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.930
 talking you do not follow the 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.060
 reproduction that would occur would be very 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.310
 cool but I'd rather this question is so 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.900
 green ball of the human 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.080

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.039
 Put a green pigment show will look 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.039
 How is it out there? 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.410
 and I loved this car there is this culture 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.530
 which I loved a lot that is very 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.490
 cool this boring rain does not 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.650

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.470
 almost chose which color 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.380
 You preferred the green toxic violet to 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.200
 violet is more for women gamers 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.440
 I see that this is more for a galera 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.270
 That from my team I liked both of them talking 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.170

 Someone is stealing here already. 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.380
 I do not think it 's a plan I had 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.970
 differences in killing this guy from him 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.140
