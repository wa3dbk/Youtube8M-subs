 area of ​​neurology around psychiatrist he briefly 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 How does one feel among so many? 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.520
 There were a total of 12 yes there you can 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.350
 In principle , we only feel good 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 we are very excited that was 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.369
 the first time we were in the 16 years 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.959
 for the galleries miss mal performed 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.200
 both what the participant the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 Victims as well as what concerns the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 There is success with the audience 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.979
 next year a repeat 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.509
 So I can already say that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.310
 Today's success proves us right 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 and I believe that next year 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.560
 Try a small increase 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.240
 should 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.979
 Say we have only the miss today 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.899
 We will vote next year 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 maybe even a mister win 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.030
 In addition, this could be a chance 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.830
 his 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.019

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.220
 support midnight shopping 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.680
 That's why I chose a poor final 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.470
 I think that the number of participants 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.630
 Candidate was great the audience was the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.170

 collective breathe the first 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.359

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.359
