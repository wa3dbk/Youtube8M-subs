artifexian here you were learn
everything<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.419> ever<00:00:03.510> wanted<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> know<00:00:04.049> about

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
everything you ever wanted to know about

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.990 
everything you ever wanted to know about
we're<00:00:04.710> building<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.310> then<00:00:06.270> some<00:00:10.370> so<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.820> want

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
we're building and then some so you want

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.549 
we're building and then some so you want
to<00:00:12.090> build<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.300> multiple<00:00:12.690> star<00:00:12.929> system<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
to build a multiple star system like the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.450 
to build a multiple star system like the
one<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.830> Battlestar<00:00:14.309> Galactica<00:00:14.849> step<00:00:15.570> warm

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.560 
one in Battlestar Galactica step warm
configuration<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.150> we're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> be

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
configuration so we're going to be

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.300 
configuration so we're going to be
working<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.990> four<00:00:19.289> stars<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:20.010> your

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
working with four stars here your

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
working with four stars here your
primary<00:00:20.820> secondary<00:00:21.180> tertiary<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
primary secondary tertiary and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400 
primary secondary tertiary and
quaternary<00:00:22.350> stars<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.250> B<00:00:23.760> C<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.300> D<00:00:24.750> take<00:00:25.199> your

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
quaternary stars a B C and D take your

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.019 
quaternary stars a B C and D take your
four<00:00:25.619> stars<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.369> divide<00:00:26.699> them<00:00:26.910> into

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
four stars and then divide them into

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
four stars and then divide them into
smaller<00:00:27.449> sub<00:00:27.810> systems<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> binary<00:00:28.680> pairs<00:00:29.130> like

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
smaller sub systems of binary pairs like

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
smaller sub systems of binary pairs like
so<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.390> hang<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.320> wanted<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so but hang on what if you wanted to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
so but hang on what if you wanted to
work<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.130> an<00:00:32.219> odd<00:00:32.430> number<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.880> stars<00:00:33.180> okay

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
work with an odd number of stars okay

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
work with an odd number of stars okay
take<00:00:34.410> tree<00:00:34.680> stars<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.640> divided<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.059> like

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
take tree stars there be divided up like

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.340 
take tree stars there be divided up like
this<00:00:36.480> five<00:00:37.469> stars<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.910> etc<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.079> rule

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this five stars like this etc the rule

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
this five stars like this etc the rule
is<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.890> divide<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.520> multiple<00:00:42.000> star<00:00:42.270> system

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is to divide your multiple star system

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
is to divide your multiple star system
into<00:00:43.260> smaller<00:00:43.649> sub<00:00:44.010> systems<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.239> two

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
into smaller sub systems of one to two

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
into smaller sub systems of one to two
stars<00:00:45.870> why<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:47.100> reasons<00:00:47.550> workability<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
stars why two reasons workability and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.319 
stars why two reasons workability and
plausibility<00:00:49.350> okay<00:00:50.190> back<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.059> stars

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
plausibility okay back to my four stars

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
plausibility okay back to my four stars
I'll<00:00:51.539> divide<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.910> sort

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I'll divide them up like this this sort

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'll divide them up like this this sort

your<00:03:46.430> binds<00:03:46.960> so<00:03:47.960> now<00:03:48.170> we<00:03:48.230> need<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> glue<00:03:48.830> our

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
your binds so now we need to glue our

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.070 
your binds so now we need to glue our
two<00:03:49.250> subsystems<00:03:49.880> together<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.630> form<00:03:50.900> our

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
two subsystems together to form our

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080 
two subsystems together to form our
fully<00:03:51.350> fledged<00:03:51.680> multiple<00:03:52.370> star<00:03:52.640> system

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
fully fledged multiple star system

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.020 
fully fledged multiple star system
firstly<00:03:54.080> find<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.710> total<00:03:55.220> mass<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.640> each<00:03:55.850> of

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
firstly find the total mass of each of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.690 
firstly find the total mass of each of
your<00:03:56.120> subsystems<00:03:56.810> like<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:57.640> pretend<00:03:58.640> a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
your subsystems like so pretend a

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880 
your subsystems like so pretend a
hypothetical<00:03:59.180> star<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.020> combined<00:04:00.590> mass

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
hypothetical star of this combined mass

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.500 
hypothetical star of this combined mass
sits<00:04:01.340> at<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.610> very<00:04:01.850> center<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:02.330> your

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
sits at the very center of your

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.870 
sits at the very center of your
subsystems<00:04:03.350> then<00:04:03.920> treat<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.370> whole<00:04:04.580> thing

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
subsystems then treat the whole thing

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.540 
subsystems then treat the whole thing
like<00:04:05.060> one<00:04:05.390> massive<00:04:05.840> distant<00:04:06.650> binary<00:04:07.100> system

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
like one massive distant binary system

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.760 
like one massive distant binary system
next<00:04:08.210> set<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.600> average<00:04:08.960> separation<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.680> your

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
next set the average separation of your

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.800 
next set the average separation of your
subsystems<00:04:10.370> anywhere<00:04:10.850> between<00:04:11.000> one<00:04:11.360> thousand
