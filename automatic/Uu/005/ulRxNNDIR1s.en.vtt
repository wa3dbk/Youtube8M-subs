 Egypt 

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.397
 There was a new king over Egypt that could not be dealt with 

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:59.060
 He said to himself: This is the people of Egypt great and great 

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:01.474
 Let us take advantage of them, they should not have access to much, 

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:08.388
 Because that will drive them to revolt against me and they may hate me and fight me through th 

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:09.304
 Facebook! 

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:15.203
 We have suffered for decades 

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:21.691
 The dictator has so far held his chair 

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:28.570
 O Egyptian, get up! From now do not give up! 

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:35.530
 The light comes out of darkness! 

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:37.078
 Go away, Mubarak! 

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.306
 You are no longer a ruler! 

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:48.429
 Of course you do not want to get involved with the repressed people 

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:50.052
 Go away, Mubarak! 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.095
 The situation will not continue! 

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:59.514
 Go away, Mubarak! Get out of here! 

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:18.291
 I have a good slave 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.109
 Do not grieve all this grief 

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:28.600
 Yes, we supported the President 

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:32.286
 But it is time for the president to retire 

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:37.618
 Before you catch ... O Mubarak, do not go! 

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.427
 Go away, Mubarak! 

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:42.047
 Because blood is shed! 

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:50.209
 Whoever supports you will find himself dead! 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.594
 Go away, Mubarak! 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.758
 Because Egypt has changed 

00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:58.255
 Until you are purified! 

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:07.811
 Because we may regret tomorrow for our delay ... 

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:19.756
 Come back, Mubarak!
