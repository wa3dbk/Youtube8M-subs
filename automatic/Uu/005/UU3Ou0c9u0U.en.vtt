okay<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> question<00:00:08.520> that<00:00:08.550> Kelsey

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
okay so this is the question that Kelsey

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480 
okay so this is the question that Kelsey
was<00:00:09.270> asking<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.050> class<00:00:10.200> today<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.860> I've

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
was asking about in class today and I've

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.000 
was asking about in class today and I've
gone<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.790> found<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.860> this<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
gone and found out and this is this is

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.270 
gone and found out and this is this is
from<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.400> 2006<00:00:15.389> NEET<00:00:15.930> trial<00:00:16.470> examiner's<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
from the 2006 NEET trial examiner's it's

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.270 
from the 2006 NEET trial examiner's it's
a<00:00:17.670> good<00:00:18.030> example<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.780> sort<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.590> quality<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
a good example of the sort of quality of

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.700 
a good example of the sort of quality of
questions<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.540> need-be<00:00:21.930> exams<00:00:22.230> are

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
questions that the need-be exams are

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
questions that the need-be exams are
well-known<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> great<00:00:24.060> question

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
well-known for it's a great question

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.530 
well-known for it's a great question
because<00:00:25.010> it's<00:00:26.010> taken<00:00:26.430> pedigrees<00:00:27.150> which<00:00:27.390> are

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
because it's taken pedigrees which are

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.050 
because it's taken pedigrees which are
on<00:00:27.630> every<00:00:27.900> exam<00:00:28.290> but<00:00:28.770> it's<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.160> looking<00:00:29.970> at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
on every exam but it's it's looking at

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.280 
on every exam but it's it's looking at
it<00:00:30.180> from<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.360> different<00:00:30.510> perspective<00:00:30.750> rather

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
it from a different perspective rather

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.930 
it from a different perspective rather
than<00:00:31.440> showing<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.860> pedigree<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.550> asking

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
than showing you a pedigree and asking

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.250 
than showing you a pedigree and asking
you<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> work<00:00:33.329> out<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> mode<00:00:34.110> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you to work out what the mode of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.739 
you to work out what the mode of
inheritance<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:35.129> based<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.420> evidence

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
inheritance is based on on the evidence

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:38.540 
inheritance is based on on the evidence
in<00:00:36.839> the<00:00:36.899> pedigree<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.800> one's<00:00:38.039> telling<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
in the pedigree this one's telling you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.430 
in the pedigree this one's telling you
what<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> mode<00:00:38.999> of<00:00:39.030> inheritance<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.749> and<00:00:39.960> then

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
what the mode of inheritance is and then

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
what the mode of inheritance is and then
it's<00:00:40.589> asking<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it's asking you to and then the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.849 
it's asking you to and then the
situation's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.199> bit<00:00:43.289> unusual<00:00:43.409> and

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
situation's a little bit unusual and

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.919 
situation's a little bit unusual and
it's<00:00:43.949> asking<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.809> until<00:00:45.809> it's

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
it's asking you to think until it's

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.599 
it's asking you to think until it's
great<00:00:46.199> because<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.620> testing<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.159> ability

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
great because it's testing your ability

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.119 
great because it's testing your ability
to<00:00:47.850> apply<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:49.109> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.530> pedigrees

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to apply what you know about pedigrees

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
to apply what you know about pedigrees
rather<00:00:50.550> than<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.940> following<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.510> pattern

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
rather than just following a pattern

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.169 
rather than just following a pattern
which<00:00:52.769> i<00:00:52.890> think<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> great<00:00:53.249> so<00:00:53.460> notice<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.030> here

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
which i think is great so notice up here

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.840 
which i think is great so notice up here
it<00:00:54.269> tells<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.659> that<00:00:54.979> syndactyly<00:00:55.979> is<00:00:56.429> a<00:00:56.489> rare

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it tells you that syndactyly is a rare

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
it tells you that syndactyly is a rare
genetic<00:00:57.030> condition<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.659> here<00:00:57.839> inherited<00:00:58.710> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
genetic condition in here inherited as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.389 
genetic condition in here inherited as
an<00:00:59.210> autosomal<00:01:00.409> dominant<00:01:01.409> trait<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.219> they're

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
an autosomal dominant trait so they're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.040 
an autosomal dominant trait so they're
telling<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.179> autosomal<00:01:03.690> dominant

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
telling you that it's autosomal dominant

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.600 
telling you that it's autosomal dominant
you<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> work<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.460> it's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you don't have to work out that it's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
you don't have to work out that it's
autosomal<00:01:06.120> dominant<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.260> say

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
autosomal dominant but they say

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
autosomal dominant but they say
unusually<00:01:08.250> however<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.329> person<00:01:09.780> who<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.259> the

giving you an allele symbol so we're

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.039 
giving you an allele symbol so we're
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.850> their<00:01:18.149> allele<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.659> symbols

we're not going to make up our own and
we're<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> use<00:01:21.030> s<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.299> syndactyly

we're going to use s for syndactyly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
we're going to use s for syndactyly
we're<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.740> n<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:23.579> what

we're going to use n because that's what

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.910 
we're going to use n because that's what
they've<00:01:23.850> given<00:01:24.000> us<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> person<00:01:25.409> so

they've given us but a person so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
they've given us but a person so
unusually<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> person<00:01:27.270> who<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.659> that

unusually a person who has that
defective<00:01:28.320> allele<00:01:28.759> does<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:30.119> always<00:01:30.590> show

so that's unusual because normally if

so that's unusual because normally if
you<00:01:36.149> have<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.930> allele<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> dominant<00:01:38.100> trait

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
you have one allele for a dominant trait

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.969 
you have one allele for a dominant trait
it<00:01:38.609> is<00:01:39.000> expressed<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.750> phenotype<00:01:40.020> but

it is expressed in your phenotype but

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.830 
it is expressed in your phenotype but
there<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.490> people<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> doesn't

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there are some people where that doesn't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.349 
there are some people where that doesn't
happen<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.469> this<00:01:43.560> case<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.180> give

happen in this case and then they give
us<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:45.659> example<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.289> a<00:01:46.530> pedigree<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> a

us an example of a pedigree and it's a
multiple<00:01:48.479> choice<00:01:48.509> question<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.289> says<00:01:49.469> there

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
multiple choice question it says there

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
multiple choice question it says there
was<00:01:49.920> no<00:01:50.159> history<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.670> syndactyly<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
was no history of syndactyly in the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.889 
was no history of syndactyly in the
ancestors<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.649> individuals<00:01:53.609> one<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.149> two<00:01:54.869> one

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
ancestors of individuals one one two one

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.069 
ancestors of individuals one one two one
and<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.950> six<00:01:56.539> assuming<00:01:57.539> that<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:57.840> were<00:01:57.929> no

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and two six assuming that there were no

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
and two six assuming that there were no
new<00:01:58.380> mutations<00:01:59.039> it's<00:01:59.789> reasonable<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
new mutations it's reasonable to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.999 
new mutations it's reasonable to
conclude<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> firstly<00:02:01.590> I'd<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
conclude what and firstly I'd like to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.230 
conclude what and firstly I'd like to
just<00:02:02.130> point<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.399> we're<00:02:02.759> saying<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
just point out we're saying is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.539 
just point out we're saying is
reasonable<00:02:03.929> so<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.200> asked<00:02:04.679> what<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:05.280> is

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
reasonable so we asked what here is

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.590 
reasonable so we asked what here is
reasonable

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
reasonable

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.290 
reasonable
not<00:02:07.049> necessarily<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.369> prove<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.850> but<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
not necessarily can we prove it but just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.630 
not necessarily can we prove it but just
is<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.570> reasonable<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.460> first<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.550> all

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
is it reasonable now first of all

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.009 
is it reasonable now first of all
they've<00:02:11.790> told<00:02:12.000> us<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.270> was<00:02:12.390> no<00:02:12.420> history<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
they've told us there was no history of

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.690 
they've told us there was no history of
syndactyly<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> ancestors<00:02:14.670> of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
syndactyly in the ancestors of

syndactyly in the ancestors of
individuals<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.780> two<00:02:16.170> one

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
individuals one one two one

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.309 
individuals one one two one
and<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.430> six<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.150> here's<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.599> one<00:02:18.930> here

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
and to six so here's one one here

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.619 
and to six so here's one one here
obviously<00:02:19.950> doesn't<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.430> syndactyly<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.450> we

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
obviously doesn't have syndactyly so we

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.559 
obviously doesn't have syndactyly so we
can<00:02:21.810> assume<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.440> her<00:02:22.920> genotype<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.909> little<00:02:24.299> n

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
can assume that her genotype is little n

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.180 
can assume that her genotype is little n
little<00:02:24.810> n<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.319> assume<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.650> because

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
little n we can assume that because

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.770 
little n we can assume that because
there's<00:02:26.340> no<00:02:26.459> history<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.879> syndactyly<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.690> her

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
there's no history of syndactyly in her

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.619 
there's no history of syndactyly in her
family<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:29.909> syndactyly<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.569> a

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
family and because syndactyly is a

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.850 
family and because syndactyly is a
dominant<00:02:31.049> trait<00:02:31.140> even<00:02:31.440> though<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.620> doesn't

reasonably conclude that all right then
it<00:03:09.900> goes<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.040> our<00:03:11.129> four<00:03:11.340> choices

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
it goes on and we have our four choices

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.670 
it goes on and we have our four choices
so<00:03:11.849> let's<00:03:12.030> work<00:03:12.359> this<00:03:12.569> through<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.049> individual

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
so let's work this through so individual

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580 
so let's work this through so individual

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.319 
little n because because this child's
father<00:03:40.500> only<00:03:40.980> has<00:03:41.370> little<00:03:41.639> n<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> father

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
father only has little n so the father

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.699 
father only has little n so the father
must<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:42.870> given<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.260> child<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.709> little<00:03:43.919> n<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
must have given this child a little n so

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.140 
must have given this child a little n so
they<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.190> n<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:47.970> got

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
they have a little n but that got

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
they have a little n but that got
syndactyly<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.840> they've<00:03:48.959> definitely<00:03:49.230> got<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
syndactyly so they've definitely got a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.159 
syndactyly so they've definitely got a
big<00:03:49.919> in<00:03:50.099> which<00:03:50.489> must<00:03:50.880> have<00:03:51.060> come<00:03:51.269> from<00:03:51.510> mum<00:03:51.840> so

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
big in which must have come from mum so

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.330 
big in which must have come from mum so
mums<00:03:52.530> genotype<00:03:53.099> must<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.609> big<00:03:53.910> n<00:03:55.340> probably

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
mums genotype must be big n probably

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.280 
mums genotype must be big n probably
began<00:03:56.669> little<00:03:57.000> n<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.389> she<00:03:57.780> must<00:03:57.989> certainly

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
began little n but she must certainly

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.080

have<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.859> must<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.400> little<00:03:59.669> and<00:03:59.760> because<00:04:00.060> of

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
have it must be little and because of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.140 
have it must be little and because of
her<00:04:00.389> mum<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:00.930> she<00:04:01.769> must<00:04:02.099> have<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.579> begin<00:04:03.030> in

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
her mum so she must have a begin in

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 
her mum so she must have a begin in

little and little and we just can't

it<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.370> say<00:05:10.400> that<00:05:10.790> these<00:05:10.940> two<00:05:11.240> may<00:05:11.630> because<00:05:12.110> it

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
it to say that these two may because it

just<00:05:12.440> says<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:13.100> they<00:05:13.310> may<00:05:13.910> have<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:15.410> same

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
just says that they may have the same

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.440 
just says that they may have the same
genotype<00:05:15.919> it's<00:05:16.370> reasonable<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.090> conclude

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
that they may have the same genotype so

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.270 
that they may have the same genotype so
we<00:05:20.780> can<00:05:20.930> put<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.110> tick<00:05:21.350> beside<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.800> one<00:05:22.130> it

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
we can put a tick beside that one it

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.050 
we can put a tick beside that one it
seems<00:05:22.550> reasonable<00:05:23.470> ok<00:05:24.470> what<00:05:24.890> about<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.910> next

this guy here individual - one has the

this guy here individual - one has the
chena<00:05:33.169> type<00:05:33.470> big<00:05:34.070> n<00:05:34.340> little<00:05:34.520> n<00:05:34.700> we'll<00:05:34.910> know

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
chena type big n little n we'll know

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.330 
chena type big n little n we'll know
we've<00:05:35.479> decided<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.680> genotype<00:05:37.130> here

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
we've decided that the genotype here

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.610 
we've decided that the genotype here
must<00:05:37.610> be<00:05:37.700> little<00:05:38.090> n<00:05:38.240> little<00:05:38.450> n<00:05:38.660> because

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
must be little n little n because

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.800 
must be little n little n because
there's<00:05:40.040> no<00:05:40.250> history<00:05:40.640> of<00:05:40.729> syndactyly<00:05:41.270> in<00:05:41.630> his

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
there's no history of syndactyly in his

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.510 
there's no history of syndactyly in his
family<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:42.620> we're<00:05:42.919> going<00:05:43.010> to<00:05:43.070> say<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.250> that's

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
family so we're going to say that that's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.870 
family so we're going to say that that's
not<00:05:43.700> a<00:05:43.940> reasonable<00:05:44.630> suggestion<00:05:45.610> based<00:05:46.610> on

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
not a reasonable suggestion based on

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.400 
not a reasonable suggestion based on
what<00:05:47.120> they've<00:05:47.270> told<00:05:47.479> us<00:05:47.720> and<00:05:47.840> finally

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
what they've told us and finally

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.140 
what they've told us and finally
individuals<00:05:49.010> 3<00:05:49.790> 2<00:05:50.060> +<00:05:50.360> 3<00:05:50.720> 5<00:05:51.140> so<00:05:51.890> that's<00:05:52.010> 3<00:05:52.460> -<00:05:52.850> this

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
individuals 3 2 + 3 5 so that's 3 - this

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.219

1 + 3 5 this one may have different

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.600 
1 + 3 5 this one may have different
genotypes<00:05:57.710> well<00:05:57.979> we've<00:05:58.130> worked<00:05:58.310> out<00:05:58.460> what<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
genotypes well we've worked out what the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.250 
genotypes well we've worked out what the
genotype<00:05:59.120> of<00:05:59.150> this<00:05:59.419> one<00:05:59.600> must<00:05:59.840> be<00:05:59.930> already

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
genotype of this one must be already

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.590 
genotype of this one must be already
this<00:06:00.950> one<00:06:01.160> here<00:06:01.460> must<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.330> at<00:06:02.780> least<00:06:02.810> one<00:06:03.200> B<00:06:03.950> n

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
this one here must have at least one B n

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.840 
this one here must have at least one B n
or<00:06:05.600> us<00:06:05.840> she<00:06:06.380> wouldn't<00:06:06.650> have<00:06:06.770> syndactyly<00:06:07.220> but

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
or us she wouldn't have syndactyly but

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.730 
or us she wouldn't have syndactyly but
if<00:06:07.940> her<00:06:08.090> dad<00:06:08.390> has<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.750> genotype<00:06:08.930> little<00:06:09.530> n

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
if her dad has the genotype little n

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.420 
if her dad has the genotype little n
little<00:06:09.950> n<00:06:10.160> then<00:06:10.700> she<00:06:11.120> must<00:06:11.870> have<00:06:12.169> an<00:06:12.440> little<00:06:13.220> n

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
little n then she must have an little n

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.219 
little n then she must have an little n
allele<00:06:13.760> which<00:06:13.970> means<00:06:14.210> that<00:06:14.390> her<00:06:14.540> genotype<00:06:15.050> is

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
allele which means that her genotype is

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.270 
allele which means that her genotype is
exactly<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.979> same<00:06:16.220> as<00:06:16.550> -<00:06:17.300> 5<00:06:17.630> s<00:06:17.840> not<00:06:18.380> different

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
exactly the same as - 5 s not different

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.640 
exactly the same as - 5 s not different
and<00:06:19.400> so<00:06:19.880> that's<00:06:20.090> an<00:06:20.270> that's<00:06:20.510> not<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.080> reasonable

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
and so that's an that's not a reasonable

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.550 
and so that's an that's not a reasonable
suggestion<00:06:22.340> so<00:06:22.729> the<00:06:23.330> most<00:06:23.600> reasonable<00:06:24.229> of

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
suggestion so the most reasonable of

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.110 
suggestion so the most reasonable of
these<00:06:25.130> of<00:06:26.030> these<00:06:26.419> choices<00:06:26.690> groups<00:06:27.500> is<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:28.610> need

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
these of these choices groups is I need

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.670 
these of these choices groups is I need
to<00:06:29.240> pick<00:06:29.390> up<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:29.660> eraser<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.380> most

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
to pick up the eraser the most

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.420 
to pick up the eraser the most
reasonable<00:06:31.520> is<00:06:31.880> this<00:06:32.510> one<00:06:32.750> here<00:06:33.169> that<00:06:34.160> these

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
reasonable is this one here that these

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.900 
reasonable is this one here that these
two<00:06:34.700> individuals<00:06:35.330> may<00:06:35.990> have<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:37.070> same

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
two individuals may have the same

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.400 
two individuals may have the same
genotype<00:06:38.240> but<00:06:38.810> that<00:06:38.900> was<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.020> pretty<00:06:39.200> tough

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
genotype but that was a pretty tough

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.620 
genotype but that was a pretty tough
question<00:06:39.830> wasn't<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.340> fun<00:06:40.820> one<00:06:41.030> but<00:06:41.330> a<00:06:41.360> tough

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
question wasn't it a fun one but a tough

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.810 
question wasn't it a fun one but a tough
one
