to<00:00:15.030> actually<00:00:15.119> bury<00:00:15.570> me<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:16.470> opinion

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
to actually bury me but in my opinion

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.000

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
and now that that happened what have we

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.610 
and now that that happened what have we
learned<00:04:11.909> and<00:04:12.180> how<00:04:12.359> do<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.569> benefit<00:04:13.230> from<00:04:13.290> that

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
learned and how do we benefit from that

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.110 
learned and how do we benefit from that
and<00:04:13.829> how<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.099> do<00:04:14.459> things<00:04:14.760> better<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
and how do we do things better and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.849 
and how do we do things better and
smarter<00:04:15.480> than<00:04:15.780> next<00:04:16.049> time<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:18.350> also<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
smarter than next time I also think the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.779 
smarter than next time I also think the
next<00:04:20.160> economy<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:21.470> going<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.830> instead<00:04:23.699> of

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
next economy is going to instead of

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.879 
next economy is going to instead of
separating<00:04:24.240> us<00:04:24.509> into<00:04:24.960> lots<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.830> different

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
separating us into lots of different

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.950 
separating us into lots of different
houses<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.699> lots<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.000> different<00:04:27.300> jobs<00:04:27.539> and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
houses and lots of different jobs and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.879 
houses and lots of different jobs and
you<00:04:28.860> know<00:04:28.979> having<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.550> life<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.449> feels<00:04:30.990> very

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
you know having a life that feels very

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.670 
you know having a life that feels very
much<00:04:32.130> like<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.810> production<00:04:33.810> or<00:04:33.930> assembly<00:04:34.470> line

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
much like a production or assembly line

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.000 
much like a production or assembly line
in<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.919> factory<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:36.750> think<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.199> next<00:04:37.229> economy<00:04:37.650> is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
in a factory I think the next economy is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.450 
in a factory I think the next economy is
going<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.750> have<00:04:39.750> us<00:04:39.900> experience<00:04:40.650> our<00:04:40.830> lives<00:04:41.130> as

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
going to have us experience our lives as

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:51.820 
going to have us experience our lives as
being<00:04:42.530> interconnected<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:48.289> really<00:04:49.289> the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.640 

sorry<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.949> said<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.340> wasn't<00:04:53.610> going<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.910> cry<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
sorry I said I wasn't going to cry the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.700 
sorry I said I wasn't going to cry the
beautiful<00:04:56.220> thing<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.180> really<00:04:57.449> is<00:04:57.990> our

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
beautiful thing that it really is our

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.129 
beautiful thing that it really is our
lives<00:04:58.919> are<00:04:59.130> amazing<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.760> we<00:05:00.000> are<00:05:00.889> beautiful

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
lives are amazing and we are beautiful

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.719 
lives are amazing and we are beautiful
and<00:05:04.970> any<00:05:06.740> economic<00:05:07.740> or<00:05:07.889> political<00:05:07.919> system

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
and any economic or political system

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.870 
and any economic or political system
that<00:05:09.000> works<00:05:09.510> to<00:05:10.139> destroy<00:05:11.070> that<00:05:11.370> should<00:05:11.699> be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
that works to destroy that should be

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.600 
that works to destroy that should be
dismantled<00:05:12.740> so<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.830> next<00:05:13.979> economy<00:05:14.280> will

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
dismantled so the next economy will

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:25.940 
dismantled so the next economy will
hopefully<00:05:15.440> nurture<00:05:16.639> something<00:05:17.639> better

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950
