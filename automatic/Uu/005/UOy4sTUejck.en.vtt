00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
going to try to make a updated one on a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.099 
going to try to make a updated one on a
Mac<00:00:15.059> farm<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:17.720> so<00:00:18.720> let's<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:20.130> started<00:00:21.109> what

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
Mac farm and so let's get started what

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
Mac farm and so let's get started what
we're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.779> do<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:26.330> which<00:00:27.330> these

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
we're going to do is do this which these

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.050 
we're going to do is do this which these
are<00:00:27.769> real<00:00:28.769> AM<00:00:29.099> kiiis<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:29.910> are

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
are real AM kiiis and these are

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.130 
are real AM kiiis and these are
collectors<00:00:30.859> you<00:00:31.859> place<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.989> collector<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
collectors you place a collector on the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.430 
collectors you place a collector on the
bottom<00:00:34.640> relay<00:00:35.640> chat<00:00:36.030> energy<00:00:36.870> chest<00:00:37.170> right

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
bottom relay chat energy chest right

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
bottom relay chat energy chest right
there<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.149> then<00:00:39.149> relay<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:41.329> basically

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there and then relay there and basically

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
there and then relay there and basically
you<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:49.010> which

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you just make it go like this and which

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
you just make it go like this and which
I<00:00:50.250> need<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> whatever<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:51.809> put

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I need it whatever you could put

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
I need it whatever you could put
anything<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
anything in there what you want to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.740 
anything in there what you want to
produce<00:00:55.370> example<00:00:56.370> anything<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.300> an<00:00:57.480> EMC

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
produce example anything that has an EMC

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
produce example anything that has an EMC
value<00:00:58.410> and<00:01:00.230> what<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
value and what I'm going to do is put a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
value and what I'm going to do is put a
diamond<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> its<00:01:04.820> diamonds

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
diamond in there this is its diamonds

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.649 
diamond in there this is its diamonds
are<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:07.080> good<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.010> produce<00:01:08.369> produce<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
are a very good way to produce produce a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.030 
are a very good way to produce produce a
lot<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> EMC<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:13.430> let's<00:01:14.430> try<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.400 

now<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:18.210> make<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.510> many<00:01:18.660> flowers<00:01:19.230> as<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
now you can make as many flowers as you

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.220 
now you can make as many flowers as you
want<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:20.010> flowers<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:21.050> energy<00:01:22.050> you're

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
want more flowers more energy you're

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.300 
want more flowers more energy you're
going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> produce<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:23.160> means<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.700> AMC

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
going to produce which means more AMC

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.450 
going to produce which means more AMC
and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.030 

basically<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.480> looks<00:01:31.540> like<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.810> flower<00:01:32.050> that's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
basically it looks like a flower that's

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.180 
basically it looks like a flower that's
why<00:01:33.250> they<00:01:33.370> call<00:01:33.550> power<00:01:33.820> flower<00:01:34.120> and<00:01:35.190> this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
why they call power flower and this

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.850 
why they call power flower and this
should<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:36.790> very<00:01:37.630> fast

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.050 

try<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.030> somewhat<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.940> you're

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
try and do this somewhat good so you're

00:01:48.060 --> 00:02:03.730 
try and do this somewhat good so you're
not<00:01:48.180> waiting<00:01:48.480> for<00:01:48.690> me

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.830 

almost<00:02:04.700> done<00:02:05.799> Mouse<00:02:06.799> is<00:02:07.100> freezing<00:02:07.580> up<00:02:07.840> sorry

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
almost done Mouse is freezing up sorry

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.690 
almost done Mouse is freezing up sorry
about<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:10.900> but<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> very<00:02:12.890> very<00:02:13.340> very

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
about that but this is a very very very

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.640 
about that but this is a very very very
good<00:02:13.850> way<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.209> do<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.780> mean<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:15.260> hard<00:02:15.560> to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
good way to do it I mean it's hard to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.710 
good way to do it I mean it's hard to
get<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> materials<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.760> do<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.450> if

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
get the materials to do this but if

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.970 
get the materials to do this but if
you're<00:02:18.080> really<00:02:18.709> good<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.040> tech<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.520> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you're really good at tech it and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.900 
you're really good at tech it and
somewhat<00:02:21.980> new<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.600> could<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:24.760> which<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
somewhat new you could do this which I

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.130 
somewhat new you could do this which I
recommend<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.390> technic<00:02:29.840> lassic<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
recommend this is for technic lassic and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.710 
recommend this is for technic lassic and
I<00:02:33.650> think<00:02:33.860> my<00:02:34.010> mouse<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.430> dang<00:02:37.630> anyway<00:02:38.630> I'm

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
I think my mouse is dang anyway I'm

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.430 
I think my mouse is dang anyway I'm
trying<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.019> hurry<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.290> possible<00:02:39.769> but<00:02:39.980> then<00:02:41.440> you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
trying to hurry as possible but then you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.759 
trying to hurry as possible but then you
put<00:02:42.709> filters<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.840> what<00:02:44.840> filters<00:02:45.410> do<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
put filters there what filters do is

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.000 
put filters there what filters do is
they<00:02:45.890> pump<00:02:46.220> out<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.500> diamonds<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.709> could<00:02:48.860> use

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
they pump out the diamonds you could use

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.370 
they pump out the diamonds you could use
transposes<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.030> filters<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.930> pump

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
transposes but filters is a they pump

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.670 
transposes but filters is a they pump
out<00:02:54.500> stacks<00:02:54.950> only<00:02:55.600> transposes<00:02:56.600> only<00:02:56.900> pump<00:02:57.410> out

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
out stacks only transposes only pump out

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.680 
out stacks only transposes only pump out
one<00:02:58.459> item<00:02:58.670> at<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> time<00:03:01.300> then<00:03:02.300> what<00:03:02.600> you're

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
one item at a time then what you're

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.240 
one item at a time then what you're
going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.870> use<00:03:02.989> next<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.680> covers<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:07.040> put

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
going to use next is covers and just put

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.630 
going to use next is covers and just put
them<00:03:07.400> here<00:03:07.430> because<00:03:07.970> when<00:03:08.209> you're<00:03:08.329> placing

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
them here because when you're placing

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.360 
them here because when you're placing
these<00:03:10.690> redstone<00:03:11.690> tubes<00:03:12.019> what<00:03:12.769> happens<00:03:13.160> is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
these redstone tubes what happens is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.430 
these redstone tubes what happens is
these<00:03:13.549> get<00:03:13.850> connected<00:03:14.120> onto<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.750> flowers<00:03:15.200> and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
these get connected onto the flowers and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.350
