I<00:00:00.949> had<00:00:01.949> stave<00:00:02.250> over<00:00:02.550> power<00:00:02.850> gate<00:00:03.120> us<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.049> we're

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
I had stave over power gate us and we're

I had stave over power gate us and we're
trying<00:00:04.980> another<00:00:05.220> experiment<00:00:05.910> today<00:00:06.029> if

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
trying another experiment today if

different design than anything that's
out<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.590> market<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.720> getting<00:00:18.720> some

out on the market and getting some

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.679 
out on the market and getting some
remarkable<00:00:19.500> results<00:00:20.180> trying<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> narrow<00:00:21.480> down

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
remarkable results trying to narrow down

remarkable results trying to narrow down
exactly<00:00:22.400> what<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.580> causing<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.210> great

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
exactly what is causing the great

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.730 
exactly what is causing the great
results<00:00:25.279> yesterday<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.840> video<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> posted

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
results yesterday the video I posted

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.350 
results yesterday the video I posted
showed<00:00:29.510> well<00:00:30.510> showed<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:31.050> zero<00:00:31.380> amps<00:00:31.969> but<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
showed well showed about zero amps but I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
showed well showed about zero amps but I
think<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.899> about<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.070> less<00:00:35.250> than

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
think it was about one if it's less than

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
think it was about one if it's less than
one<00:00:35.579> amp<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.120> half<00:00:36.360> an<00:00:36.510> amp<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
one amp is about half an amp because

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.459 
one amp is about half an amp because
unfortunately<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:38.850> ammeter<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.540> extremely

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
unfortunately my ammeter is extremely

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.790 
unfortunately my ammeter is extremely
coarse<00:00:41.210> but<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.870> ammeter<00:00:43.020> works<00:00:43.500> few

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
coarse but it the ammeter works few

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
coarse but it the ammeter works few
people<00:00:44.040> asked<00:00:44.309> me<00:00:44.340> well<00:00:44.610> maybe<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> ammeter

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
people asked me well maybe the ammeter

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060 
people asked me well maybe the ammeter
wasn't<00:00:45.989> working<00:00:46.320> even<00:00:46.559> though<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> showed

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
wasn't working even though it showed

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
wasn't working even though it showed
zero<00:00:47.210> does<00:00:48.210> work<00:00:48.480> tested<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.690> only

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
zero does work tested it the only

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.729 
zero does work tested it the only
difference<00:00:52.699> between<00:00:53.699> pulling<00:00:54.600> 31<00:00:55.230> amps<00:00:55.559> with

with<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> set<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:01.140> very<00:01:01.890> powerful<00:01:02.600> water

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
with a set up is a very powerful water

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.980 
with a set up is a very powerful water
of<00:01:03.840> added<00:01:04.320> twenty<00:01:04.710> drops<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:06.600> call<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of added twenty drops and I call it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
of added twenty drops and I call it
organ<00:01:07.470> water<00:01:07.880> it's<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.689> live<00:01:09.930> water<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.950> a

angle of 114 instead of 104.5 so over
time<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.460> amperage<00:01:20.939> draw<00:01:21.210> went<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.570> 31<00:01:22.200> down

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
time the amperage draw went from 31 down

to less than an amp and the output

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.210 
to less than an amp and the output
stayed<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> same<00:01:27.090> today<00:01:28.049> I've<00:01:28.409> made<00:01:28.470> one

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
stayed the same today I've made one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.010 
stayed the same today I've made one
change<00:01:29.250> only<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.680> added<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> toroid<00:01:32.189> coil<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
change only I added a toroid coil and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.249 
change only I added a toroid coil and
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> troy<00:01:34.650> coil<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.250> there

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.249 

alright<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.530> we're<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:42.259> simply

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
alright what we're going to do is simply

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
alright what we're going to do is simply
plug<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.220> at<00:01:44.369> zero<00:01:44.700> amps<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.090> now

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
plug this in it's at zero amps right now

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
plug this in it's at zero amps right now
and<00:01:45.750> plug<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.399> freshly<00:01:47.790> charged

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and plug it in to a freshly charged

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:59.920 
and plug it in to a freshly charged
battery<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:49.439> what<00:01:49.619> happens

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:11.570 

okay<00:02:00.930> she's<00:02:01.470> all<00:02:01.770> plugged<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.690 

as<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.570> see<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.080> good<00:02:13.350> output<00:02:13.830> now

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
as you can see we have good output now

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.210 
as you can see we have good output now
this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.930> are<00:02:16.170> watching<00:02:16.380> closely<00:02:16.710> this

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
this is if you are watching closely this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.450 
this is if you are watching closely this
is<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.990> would<00:02:18.990> say<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.350> three<00:02:19.620> times<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
is I would say about three times the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.340 
is I would say about three times the
output<00:02:20.820> as<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.280> video<00:02:23.550> from<00:02:23.760> yesterday<00:02:24.350> when

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
output as the video from yesterday when

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.940 
output as the video from yesterday when
we<00:02:25.500> had<00:02:25.650> zero<00:02:25.890> amps<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.350> use<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.380> using<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
we had zero amps so use just using the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.700 
we had zero amps so use just using the
toilet<00:02:29.160> coil<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.810> boosting<00:02:31.290> output

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
toilet coil is really boosting output

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.260 
toilet coil is really boosting output
the<00:02:32.340> amps<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.970> gone<00:02:33.210> up<00:02:35.060> yesterday<00:02:36.060> they

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the amps have gone up yesterday they

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.800 
the amps have gone up yesterday they
were<00:02:36.710> registering<00:02:39.440> right<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.680> about<00:02:41.330> well<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
were registering right at about well the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.730 
were registering right at about well the
needle<00:02:43.200> showed<00:02:43.500> zero<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.410> it's

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
needle showed zero so right now it's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.000 
needle showed zero so right now it's
probably<00:02:47.400> at<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> half<00:02:48.750> maybe<00:02:49.680> two

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
probably at one and a half maybe two

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.380 
probably at one and a half maybe two
amps<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:54.080> we<00:02:55.080> get<00:02:55.560> tremendous<00:02:55.980> output<00:02:56.730> so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
amps and we get tremendous output so

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.110 
amps and we get tremendous output so
good<00:02:58.350> output<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:59.100> one-and-a-half<00:02:59.670> amps<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
good output at one-and-a-half amps and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.360 
good output at one-and-a-half amps and
the<00:03:03.180> only<00:03:03.480> difference<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.709> simply<00:03:05.160> put<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the only difference is I simply put a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.630 
the only difference is I simply put a
toroid<00:03:05.970> coil<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.450> that's<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.170> very<00:03:07.470> only<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> few

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
toroid coil and that's a very only a few

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.160 
toroid coil and that's a very only a few
windings<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.300> coil<00:03:10.100> I'll<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:12.170> whine

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
windings on that coil I'll have to whine

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.729 
windings on that coil I'll have to whine
one<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.560> has<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.930> there<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.320> if

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
one that has more so there you go if

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.770 
one that has more so there you go if
you're<00:03:17.370> interested<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.260> setup

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.160 
you're interested in this in this setup
I'm<00:03:21.780> actually<00:03:22.550> setting<00:03:23.550> up<00:03:23.640> dealers<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.330> you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I'm actually setting up dealers and you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620 
I'm actually setting up dealers and you
get<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.500> complete<00:03:25.769> vortex<00:03:26.340> cell<00:03:26.640> that's<00:03:26.910> it's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
get the complete vortex cell that's it's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.720 
get the complete vortex cell that's it's
not<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:28.170> test<00:03:28.680> setup<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
not a test setup like this it's the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.880 
not a test setup like this it's the
actual<00:03:30.090> operating<00:03:30.690> cell<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.560> put<00:03:31.769> in

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
actual operating cell that can be put in

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
actual operating cell that can be put in
a<00:03:31.980> vehicle<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.810> toroid<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> vortex

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
a vehicle with the toroid so the vortex

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.280 
a vehicle with the toroid so the vortex
cell<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> toroid<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:38.700> get<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.150> pwm<00:03:40.080> that

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
cell with a toroid you get the pwm that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.890 
cell with a toroid you get the pwm that
we<00:03:40.380> use<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.830> constant<00:03:41.310> current<00:03:41.580> pwm<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.720> is

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
we use is constant current pwm this is

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.370 
we use is constant current pwm this is
the<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.290> use<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.800> big<00:03:43.980> kahuna<00:03:45.380> you'll

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the one we use on the big kahuna you'll

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.979 
the one we use on the big kahuna you'll
receive<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.830> 35<00:03:47.459> amp<00:03:47.760> one<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.150> one's<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.480> 90<00:03:48.780> amp

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
receive a 35 amp one this one's a 90 amp

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.520 
receive a 35 amp one this one's a 90 amp
one<00:03:49.550> costs<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.610> lot<00:03:50.760> more<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:54.230> you'll<00:03:55.230> receive

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
one costs a lot more and you'll receive

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.210 
one costs a lot more and you'll receive
four<00:03:56.130> ounces<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.730> water<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.709> can<00:03:58.860> use<00:03:59.040> I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
four ounces of water that you can use I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.370 
four ounces of water that you can use I
only<00:03:59.250> use<00:03:59.550> 20<00:03:59.850> drops<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.600> four<00:04:00.810> ounces<00:04:01.110> will<00:04:01.260> go

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
only use 20 drops so four ounces will go

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.130 
only use 20 drops so four ounces will go
a<00:04:01.410> long<00:04:01.590> way<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.570> there<00:04:03.570> is<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.840> output<00:04:06.019> see<00:04:07.019> it

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
a long way so there is the output see it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.259 
a long way so there is the output see it
makes<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.440> foamy<00:04:07.739> froth<00:04:08.130> looks<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> good

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
makes a foamy froth looks like a good

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.690 
makes a foamy froth looks like a good
rich<00:04:09.840> beer<00:04:11.750> and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.380 

that's<00:04:18.700> about<00:04:18.910> it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
that's about it
