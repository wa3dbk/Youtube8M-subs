copy<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.430> last<00:01:29.640> match<00:01:29.880> guys<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.780> said<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
copy of my last match guys as I said the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
copy of my last match guys as I said the
PVR<00:01:31.530> cocked<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.250> my<00:01:32.340> last<00:01:32.490> match<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.970> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
PVR cocked up on my last match so we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
PVR cocked up on my last match so we
were<00:01:33.180> unable<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> footage<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
were unable to get the footage but this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
were unable to get the footage but this
is<00:01:35.430> essentially<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> volume<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
is essentially for the volume of it so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.460 
is essentially for the volume of it so
I'm<00:01:36.990> hit<00:01:37.170> im<00:01:37.200> doing<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> essentially<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I'm hit im doing this is essentially a

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.510 
I'm hit im doing this is essentially a
carbon<00:01:40.470> copy<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> previous<00:01:41.310> match

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
carbon copy of the previous match

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
carbon copy of the previous match
hopefully<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.509> won't<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.780> too<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.140> lag

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
hopefully we won't get too much lag

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.399 
hopefully we won't get too much lag
playing<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.720> we'll<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> I
