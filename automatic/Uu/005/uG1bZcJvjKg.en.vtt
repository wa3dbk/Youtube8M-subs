whole<00:01:50.240> concept<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:52.340> being<00:01:52.729> able<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.090> kind

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
whole concept of just being able to kind

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
you just cannot achieve them because of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.899 
you just cannot achieve them because of
social<00:01:58.490> boundaries<00:01:59.000> because<00:01:59.540> of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
social boundaries because of

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.899 
social boundaries because of
circumstantial<00:02:01.909> kind<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.600> limitations<00:02:03.909> so

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
circumstantial kind of limitations so

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.580 
circumstantial kind of limitations so
everything<00:02:05.510> we<00:02:05.659> do<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.140> kind<00:02:06.500> of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
everything we do and that kind of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.199 
everything we do and that kind of
translates<00:02:07.070> through<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.549> print<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:08.000> well

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
translates through to the print as well

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
collection we'll start doing that right

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.630 
collection we'll start doing that right
in<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> beginning<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.500> weird<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:43.010> draping

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
in the beginning so weird like draping

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.600 
in the beginning so weird like draping
it's<00:02:43.879> very<00:02:44.120> organic<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:46.250> will<00:02:46.430> run

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
it's very organic and that will run

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.100 
it's very organic and that will run
right<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.030> way<00:02:47.120> through<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.540> end<00:02:47.569> until<00:02:48.019> we

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
right the way through the end until we

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.479 
right the way through the end until we
actually<00:02:48.260> decide<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:48.920> what<00:02:49.069> we're<00:02:49.190> doing<00:02:49.220> for
