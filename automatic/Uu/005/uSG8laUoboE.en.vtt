00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.379
 two 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.170
 Carlos Alvarez 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.170
 9 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.650
 plus 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.820
 but if what I like least is not me 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.590
 they call it a little stubborn I do not know 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.340
 I believe that I can not imagine the s &amp; p no 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 they only like this one 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 instead of pretending to be a worker 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.510
 and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.000
 then many doors on things and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.910
 another one that did not try to be friends with 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.890
 my friends left me 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.110
 with grievances of the truth that 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 and I have good football boots 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.579
 always the somewhat blessed fact of when 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.070
 my mother the new boots before playing 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.820
 with them for the first time always 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.130
 I try to go to the showers myself 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 to leave a couple of things that do not 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.610
 we always start in the gymnastics of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.589
 torrelavega and the truth that year then 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.659
 I was very good and since then I 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.509
 I continue doing 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.710
 and there are not many people there who know about 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.710
 everything and there is a very good atmosphere 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 the bones, well, I do not know, I can imagine 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.380
 yes 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.880
 I had tried to be an engineer to me 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.649
 there are eight subjects left to finish the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.140
 career and I imagine it would be 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.149
 trying to find work from it like 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.030
 almost all my friends that many have not 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.659
 finished and are waiting to see if yes 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.659
 they get a job 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.550
 to my parents and my family 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.680
 generating the truth that I think they have 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.110
 proven throughout life what is it that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520
 is to work what they call what is what 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.790
 that are worth the things that is also 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 important and that I think is a greater 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.280
 greater appreciation greater appreciation for me 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.730
 that everything else not then for them 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.120
 they are all 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.420
 for lost 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.210
 the worst I think it has been with the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.020
 sporting when a line of promotion of 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.020
 third second b 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.490
 and then as always we gave forward yes 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.510
 The truth is that it was one day 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.580
 a hard day in football and the truth that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.550
 I have had the luck of failure so 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.260
 from not having that way and a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.940
 blow I think I had not good these 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.120
 days you may have had hard days of 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.010
 do not play of turtles but but I think 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.350
 that yes diawara stick like that was and apart with 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.860
 when you are younger than what comes to you 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.420
 but not that you have the illusion and everything 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.420
 I think it has not been the most 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.569
 the day then of certainly no in 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.819
 hospitals June 22 that is there 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.819
 through which I would not forgive 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:03:02.769
 I do not know what I would not forgive I think 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.819
 I try to always understand why 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.849
 what people do what they do 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.950
 so I do not know if it is what it is and 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.420
 I would forgive what no more than anything 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.980
 not be able to understand I think that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 it would be the most difficult for me to forgive 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.209
 his name does not make me laugh a lot 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.519
 truth there is no more to laugh a lot of things 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.290
 the river I laugh a lot and the truth is that 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.290
 I'm always messing around and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.700
 so so one day a chilean knowing that 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.420
 I could talk outdoors 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.420
 our 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.110
 when when I can not play at 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.380
 soccer I imagine that bigger seed 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.380
 what do i have 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.489
 when I was little and I think that frees him 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.989
 ton from almost every one of my 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.640
 fifth and we play football I think that 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.030
 as a child for hours and hours thinking 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.030
 what was it 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:07.760
 I do not have several but then I heard 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:15.280
 I hear quite pretty quickly what 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:19.030
 I listen a lot, well, sacred jackson 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.030
 he is a writer who 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:29.840
 with my anthology with a favorite I have 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.840
 doubts but I think the white 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.580
 favorite food any 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.560
 how amazing because the best is 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.030
 worth saying come let's have a match 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.440
 important do you want to put all 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.680
 It's worth with new ones if you ask me 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.290
 I say Chilean to sources but not the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.630
 truth that I did not expect it nor never what 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.900
 I dreamed a truth that until today is 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.820
 the most important thing that I have done and I 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.160
 I feel very fortunate that that day 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.160
 because the bulb is illuminated and it came out 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.800
 Well, that's the host 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.930
 I came here and now one day that 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.970
 this will continue and will continue to be 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.370
 saints of leganÃ©s and pepineros and bands and 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.280
 they would be making me videos if it arrives and 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.199
 you will remember people will remember 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.270
 because in the end how many agreeing 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.789
 those of '93 will remember us 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.800
 yes and we believe that after some other day 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.440
 your day will come to celebrate and second and 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.880
 the yes days will be remembered because the 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.060
 truth is that I am very proud of 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.060
 it 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.620
 if we are that is pissed because 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.139
 You know the problem when you start debating 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.360
 in all the debates because in the end it arrives 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.550
 one in which he is not right what happens 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.319
 that I'm chemistry of the wardrobe and 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.509
 when it came in it's because I come in you know 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.699
 so I understand that he has that fly 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.889
 but there are many topics in which 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.689
 not when he tried to enter when 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.240
 contraband with formulated written the day 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.169
 debating and that and he knows when I go in 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.169
 serious when I'm going to do it 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:30.159
 I can not ask what 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:31.659
 how he felt as he lived in the 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.129
 move up in hospitals after what 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.460
 had happened to him he has no alcohol 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.460
 with no 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.810
 It's a shame you make a bicycle kick 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.810
 chilean
