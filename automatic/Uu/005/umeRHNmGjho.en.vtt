 he gets she wants 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.559
 this is really a cargo bike two points, he says 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 the ultramodern cargo bike Tymoshenko through the city well I have not seen them but 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.210
 just as handy 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 what you can certainly do it up to 4 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 children enter think animals 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.490
 in a draw 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.910
 yes, we will certainly look into it later 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.049
 they can stay 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.230
 they can stand 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 this possibility is not in itself 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.930
 nadal you know very quickly no longer I think that is waiting for 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.030
 as long as they don't 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.360
 are you an algerian that say how can you no longer 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 I heard the tram the badcuyp there a new names of interim trainer 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.200
 boys and girls currently as the inner lane to designate the 7 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 but with klm she says 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.050
 wyclef 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.550
 just not quiet 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 no i don't think so 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 he says a completely different story 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.550
 after a few eighties 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 this is real 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.430
 alex ferguson 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.690
 and furthermore a huge loss of the club is going to play football but I know 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 certainly 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340
 their behavior 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.440
 al j 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.930
 the debate even more room of the KLPD 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 I also get an hour discount in it 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 the elections 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:45.850
 boys 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.850
 on the second and third set 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.219
 I just heard 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.040
 and yes 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.219
 he said to count the australian went with his all 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.219
