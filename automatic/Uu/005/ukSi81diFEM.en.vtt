do<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.490> he<00:03:19.360> his<00:03:19.810> job<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.290> sit<00:03:20.680> back<00:03:21.090> movie

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
do this he his job is to sit back movie

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.240 
do this he his job is to sit back movie
and<00:03:22.360> relax<00:03:22.630> his<00:03:22.840> center<00:03:23.170> line<00:03:23.320> back<00:03:23.740> toward<00:03:24.100> me

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
and relax his center line back toward me

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.040 
and relax his center line back toward me
so<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.820> hitting<00:03:25.390> me<00:03:25.420> he's<00:03:25.690> not<00:03:25.870> being

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
pushed over toward the front the center

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.020 
pushed over toward the front the center
one<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.610> gid<00:03:30.610> points<00:03:31.060> wat<00:03:31.240> po<00:03:31.420> g<00:03:31.660> IG<00:03:31.930> park<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
one of gid points wat po g IG park and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.550 
one of gid points wat po g IG park and
then<00:03:34.209> these<00:03:34.300> other<00:03:34.480> areas<00:03:34.870> are<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.320> bladder

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
then these other areas are the bladder

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.370 
then these other areas are the bladder
channel<00:03:35.680> two<00:03:36.160> inches<00:03:36.459> from<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.790> center

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.780 

and<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.210> inside<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
and on the inside of the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:58.270

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.400 

so<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.950> being<00:04:02.190> performed<00:04:03.410> you

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
so yeah as this is being performed you

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.620 
so yeah as this is being performed you
can<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.070> idea<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.550> what<00:04:05.700> occurs<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.300> simply

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
can the idea of what occurs is simply

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.210 
can the idea of what occurs is simply
this<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.380> idea<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.780> by<00:04:10.440> making<00:04:10.920> all

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
this the idea is this that by making all

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.780 
this the idea is this that by making all
these<00:04:11.370> nerve<00:04:11.670> impulses<00:04:12.980> react<00:04:13.980> all<00:04:14.430> up<00:04:14.700> and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
these nerve impulses react all up and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.840 
these nerve impulses react all up and
down<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> spine<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:16.290> gets<00:04:16.860> moving<00:04:17.340> too<00:04:17.580> quick

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
down the spine it gets moving too quick

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.820 
down the spine it gets moving too quick
for<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.150> brain<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.110> brain<00:04:19.230> just<00:04:19.470> sends<00:04:19.769> a

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
for the brain and the brain just sends a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.100 
for the brain and the brain just sends a
message<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.280> relaxes<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.150> whole<00:04:21.390> area<00:04:21.900> or

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
message and relaxes this whole area or

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.660 
message and relaxes this whole area or
the<00:04:22.650> lines<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.400> force<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.790> viewer<00:04:25.670> the

the lines that force that viewer the

have a more vibrational effect and you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.080
