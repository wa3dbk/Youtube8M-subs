console<00:03:43.310> yet<00:03:43.489> but<00:03:43.730> I'm<00:03:43.880> hoping<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.329> they<00:03:44.450> do

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
console yet but I'm hoping that they do

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.699 
console yet but I'm hoping that they do
because<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.579> mean<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.609> think<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.150> very

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
because I mean I think this is a very

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.319 
because I mean I think this is a very
well<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:49.250> my<00:03:49.430> opinion<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:49.880> think<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.299> a

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
well in my opinion I think this is a

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.819 
well in my opinion I think this is a
very<00:03:50.600> well<00:03:50.810> balanced<00:03:51.230> game<00:03:51.470> there<00:03:51.709> are<00:03:51.739> a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
very well balanced game there are a

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.110 
very well balanced game there are a
couple<00:03:52.070> of<00:03:52.190> things<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.549> can<00:03:52.730> say<00:03:52.880> definitely

couple of things I can say definitely

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.420 
couple of things I can say definitely

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.710 
to put out in the PC patches they're
gonna<00:04:12.680> increase<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.579> amount<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.269> points<00:04:14.540> that

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
gonna increase the amount of points that

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680 
gonna increase the amount of points that
you<00:04:14.900> have<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.230> get<00:04:15.410> in<00:04:15.829> sector<00:04:16.789> control<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.539> in

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you have to get in sector control and in

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.330 
you have to get in sector control and in
team<00:04:17.900> assault<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:18.560> that's<00:04:18.829> really<00:04:19.070> good<00:04:19.220> it's

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
team assault so that's really good it's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.650 
team assault so that's really good it's
gonna<00:04:19.489> bring<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.850> game<00:04:20.030> time<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.299> little<00:04:20.479> bit

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
gonna bring the game time a little bit

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.120 
gonna bring the game time a little bit
longer<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.169> gives<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.380> more<00:04:21.530> time<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.799> try<00:04:22.070> to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
longer and gives you more time to try to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.300 
longer and gives you more time to try to
build<00:04:22.340> up<00:04:22.490> your<00:04:22.520> score<00:04:22.880> chains<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.360> stuff

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
build up your score chains and stuff

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.430 
build up your score chains and stuff
because<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.270> find<00:04:25.510> myself<00:04:25.690> getting<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.290> like

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
because I find myself getting in like

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.680 
because I find myself getting in like
really<00:04:26.770> high<00:04:26.920> score<00:04:27.310> chains<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.450> then<00:04:28.600> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
really high score chains but then the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.900 
really high score chains but then the
game<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:29.050> ends<00:04:29.440> or<00:04:29.770> I'll<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> score

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
game just ends or I'll have a score

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.610 
game just ends or I'll have a score
chain<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:31.240> hand<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.720> forget<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.139> call<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.500> in

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
chain on hand and forget to call it in

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.020 
chain on hand and forget to call it in
or<00:04:32.740> something<00:04:32.850> which<00:04:33.850> kind<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.150> sucks<00:04:34.450> but

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
or something which kind of sucks but

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.890 
or something which kind of sucks but
nothing<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.389> they<00:04:37.510> said<00:04:37.660> they're<00:04:37.810> gonna

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
nothing to that they said they're gonna

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.250 
nothing to that they said they're gonna
fix<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.680> they're<00:04:38.830> gonna<00:04:39.210> put<00:04:40.210> more<00:04:40.389> recoil<00:04:40.930> on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
fix is they're gonna put more recoil on

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.460 
fix is they're gonna put more recoil on
the<00:04:41.530> guns<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.190> they're<00:04:42.550> gonna<00:04:42.669> decrease<00:04:43.470> the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
the guns and they're gonna decrease the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.800 
the guns and they're gonna decrease the
spread<00:04:44.950> or<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.370> accuracy<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> should<00:04:46.389> say<00:04:46.570> on

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
spread or the accuracy I should say on

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.420 
spread or the accuracy I should say on
the<00:04:47.100> hipfire<00:04:48.100> in<00:04:48.520> this<00:04:48.669> game<00:04:53.040> but<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.250> know<00:04:54.340> I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
the hipfire in this game but you know I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.590 
the hipfire in this game but you know I
think<00:04:54.610> that's<00:04:54.880> really<00:04:55.030> good<00:04:55.240> things<00:04:55.450> that

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
think that's really good things that

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.730 
think that's really good things that
they're<00:04:55.720> gonna<00:04:55.810> put<00:04:56.020> into<00:04:56.230> I'm<00:04:56.410> happy<00:04:56.710> that

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
they're gonna put into I'm happy that

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.250 
they're gonna put into I'm happy that
they're<00:04:57.070> gonna<00:04:57.630> put<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.660> patch<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.050> hopefully

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
they're gonna put a patch on hopefully

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.980 
they're gonna put a patch on hopefully
they<00:04:59.470> just<00:04:59.650> bring<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.040> console<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.900> you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
they just bring it to console and as you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.360 
they just bring it to console and as you
guys<00:05:02.140> know<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.500> map<00:05:02.680> packs<00:05:02.950> are<00:05:03.100> gonna<00:05:03.190> be

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
guys know the map packs are gonna be

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.670 
guys know the map packs are gonna be
coming<00:05:03.550> out<00:05:03.820> I<00:05:04.180> think<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.050> dates<00:05:05.230> November

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
coming out I think the dates November

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.970 
coming out I think the dates November
2nd<00:05:06.120> hopefully<00:05:07.120> they<00:05:07.270> put<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.510> patch<00:05:07.980> along

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
2nd hopefully they put a patch along

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.950 
2nd hopefully they put a patch along
with<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:10.030> think<00:05:10.600> it'd<00:05:10.690> be<00:05:10.720> kind<00:05:10.930> of

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
with that so I think it'd be kind of

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.200 
with that so I think it'd be kind of
interesting<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.470> look<00:05:11.530> back<00:05:11.830> on<00:05:12.010> these<00:05:12.210> older

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
interesting to look back on these older

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.330 
interesting to look back on these older
gameplays<00:05:13.630> here<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:13.960> kind<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.140> compare<00:05:14.350> what

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
gameplays here and kind of compare what

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.890 
gameplays here and kind of compare what
they<00:05:15.460> did<00:05:15.669> in<00:05:15.790> the<00:05:15.880> patch<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.450> some<00:05:16.690> newer

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
they did in the patch and some newer

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.700 
they did in the patch and some newer
gameplay<00:05:17.320> I'll<00:05:17.620> upload<00:05:18.030> later<00:05:19.030> on<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.710> see
