it<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.590> like<00:04:00.340> we're<00:04:00.640> in<00:04:00.760> shangri-la<00:04:01.150> actually

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
it is like we're in shangri-la actually

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.120 
it is like we're in shangri-la actually
is<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:02.050> I<00:04:02.140> don't<00:04:02.200> know<00:04:02.290> how<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.650> works<00:04:02.890> out

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
is like I don't know how that works out

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.910 
is like I don't know how that works out
in<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.670> whole<00:04:04.600> storyline<00:04:05.020> of<00:04:05.200> phase<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.800> it's

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
in the whole storyline of phase and it's

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.430 
in the whole storyline of phase and it's
just<00:04:06.130> really<00:04:06.370> confusing<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:07.300> that's<00:04:07.989> like

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
just really confusing but that's like

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.650 
just really confusing but that's like
solid<00:04:09.010> proof<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.820> know<00:04:09.970> shangri-la

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
solid proof that you know shangri-la

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.270 
solid proof that you know shangri-la
could<00:04:11.050> be<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.620> different<00:04:11.769> planet<00:04:12.100> than

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
could be on a different planet than

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.740 
could be on a different planet than
Earth<00:04:12.519> ah<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:15.100> there's<00:04:15.940> another<00:04:16.239> thing<00:04:16.510> that

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
Earth ah but there's another thing that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.470 
Earth ah but there's another thing that
I<00:04:16.780> won't<00:04:17.709> want<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.010> say<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.730> has<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.239> do

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
I won't want to say and it has to do

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.170 
I won't want to say and it has to do
with<00:04:19.660> moon<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.859> if<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.760> go<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> ng

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
with moon and if you go to ng

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.490 
with moon and if you go to ng
zombies<00:04:24.080> their<00:04:24.590> profile<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.080> if<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.229> look<00:04:27.380> up

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
zombies their profile and if you look up

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.050 
zombies their profile and if you look up
their<00:04:27.620> videos<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:28.130> said<00:04:28.280> what<00:04:28.550> happens

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
their videos that said what happens

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.540 
their videos that said what happens
after<00:04:29.389> moon<00:04:29.570> look<00:04:29.810> up<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.080> video<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.710> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
after moon look up that video and you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.040 
after moon look up that video and you
know<00:04:31.639> he<00:04:31.910> does<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.270> whole<00:04:32.389> easter<00:04:32.840> egg<00:04:32.960> on

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
know he does the whole easter egg on

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.749 
know he does the whole easter egg on
moon<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.530> then<00:04:33.620> he<00:04:33.710> goes<00:04:33.830> back<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.070> area<00:04:34.310> 51

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
moon and then he goes back to area 51

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.939 
moon and then he goes back to area 51
you<00:04:35.030> know<00:04:35.180> it's<00:04:35.389> it's<00:04:35.630> all<00:04:35.780> destroyed<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.830> he

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
you know it's it's all destroyed but he

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.980 
you know it's it's all destroyed but he
goes<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.370> one<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.669> corners<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.360> jumps<00:04:38.840> up

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
goes to one of the corners and jumps up

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.930 
goes to one of the corners and jumps up
and<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.470> see<00:04:39.680> earth<00:04:39.979> destroyed<00:04:40.550> from

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
and you can see earth destroyed from

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.390 
and you can see earth destroyed from
area<00:04:41.360> 51<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.949> I<00:04:43.370> what<00:04:44.030> I'm<00:04:44.150> thinking<00:04:44.660> is<00:04:45.400> like

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
area 51 so I what I'm thinking is like

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.700 
area 51 so I what I'm thinking is like
that's<00:04:46.850> just<00:04:47.060> all<00:04:47.270> confusing<00:04:47.509> like<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.350> area

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
that's just all confusing like that area

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.560 
that's just all confusing like that area
51<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.130> either<00:04:49.310> not<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.729> earth<00:04:49.880> they<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.330> they

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
51 is either not on earth they get they

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.760 
51 is either not on earth they get they
could<00:04:50.810> be<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.110> an<00:04:51.199> alternate<00:04:51.650> dimension

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
could be in an alternate dimension

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.129 
could be in an alternate dimension
because<00:04:52.190> one<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.240> Richthofen<00:04:53.690> schools

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
because one of the Richthofen schools

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.450 
because one of the Richthofen schools
after<00:04:54.320> you<00:04:54.470> complete<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.889> first<00:04:55.130> part<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
after you complete the first part of the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.790 
after you complete the first part of the
Easter<00:04:55.699> egg<00:04:55.729> is<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:57.169> something<00:04:57.349> to<00:04:57.470> do<00:04:57.650> with

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
Easter egg is it something to do with

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.650 
Easter egg is it something to do with
like<00:04:58.009> alternate<00:04:58.430> dimensions<00:04:58.880> himself<00:04:59.270> it's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
like alternate dimensions himself it's

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.960 
like alternate dimensions himself it's
just<00:04:59.930> it's<00:05:00.259> just<00:05:00.349> really<00:05:00.830> confusing<00:05:01.099> how<00:05:01.789> this

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
just it's just really confusing how this

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.320 
just it's just really confusing how this
story<00:05:02.180> line<00:05:02.509> is<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:03.320> know<00:05:03.440> panning<00:05:03.860> out<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.460> go

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
story line is you know panning out to go

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.620 
story line is you know panning out to go
go<00:05:05.870> on<00:05:06.080> with<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:09.560> know<00:05:09.680> I<00:05:10.060> I'm<00:05:11.060> just<00:05:11.389> super

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
go on with and you know I I'm just super

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.770 
go on with and you know I I'm just super
confused<00:05:12.199> by<00:05:12.320> this<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.620> I'm<00:05:13.460> thinking<00:05:13.789> from

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
confused by this and I'm thinking from

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.040 
confused by this and I'm thinking from
that<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.710> could<00:05:16.099> say<00:05:16.340> that<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:17.020> moon<00:05:18.020> that

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
that you could say that the moon that

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.830 
that you could say that the moon that
you're<00:05:18.380> on<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.639> moon<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.270> big<00:05:20.479> moon<00:05:20.690> of

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
you're on is the moon the big moon of

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.170 
you're on is the moon the big moon of
Jupiter<00:05:21.289> says<00:05:21.979> jupiter<00:05:22.400> has<00:05:22.490> four<00:05:22.699> moons<00:05:22.910> and

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
Jupiter says jupiter has four moons and

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.420 
Jupiter says jupiter has four moons and
then<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.509> area<00:05:23.750> 51<00:05:24.199> you're<00:05:24.349> on<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:25.070> another

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
then the area 51 you're on is another

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.040 
then the area 51 you're on is another
moon<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:25.820> Jupiter<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.419> if<00:05:26.539> you<00:05:26.630> jump<00:05:26.870> up<00:05:26.990> there

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
moon of Jupiter and if you jump up there

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.920 
moon of Jupiter and if you jump up there
there's<00:05:27.590> another<00:05:28.310> moon<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.849> don't<00:05:29.570> know<00:05:29.630> it's

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
there's another moon I don't know it's

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.649 
there's another moon I don't know it's
so<00:05:30.080> hard<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.380> explain<00:05:30.760> but<00:05:31.760> you<00:05:32.150> know<00:05:32.270> there's

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
so hard to explain but you know there's

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.330 
so hard to explain but you know there's
so<00:05:32.990> much<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.380> do<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.710> could<00:05:33.919> be<00:05:34.010> alternate

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
so much to do it could be alternate

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.219 
so much to do it could be alternate
mentions<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.090> whole<00:05:35.300> time<00:05:35.570> this<00:05:35.810> is<00:05:35.990> been<00:05:36.139> on

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
a different dimension it's been on

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.820 
a different dimension it's been on
Jupiter<00:05:37.909> it's<00:05:38.060> been<00:05:38.180> on<00:05:38.270> anything<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.409> it's

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
Jupiter it's been on anything it's it's

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.950 
Jupiter it's been on anything it's it's
just<00:05:40.220> from<00:05:40.789> looking<00:05:41.120> at<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.389> it<00:05:41.599> just<00:05:41.780> the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
just from looking at that it just the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.450 
just from looking at that it just the
story<00:05:42.199> line<00:05:42.349> just<00:05:42.530> takes<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.830> whole<00:05:43.010> different
