00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.100
 when have a turn play screen 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.109
 ok we are then on the screen for the game 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.530
 Let's see how it is that father who 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.530
 I have 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.939
 let's see the ones here simply 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.490
 to form one more time against the PT 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.540
 understand finds quite propitious young 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.150
 team gave English to oscar sandro 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.009
 ramires valencia people that go right 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 someone else's company won the goalkeeper 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.009
 I did not see who was a very strong team. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 and English 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.600
 so if I can get several home 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600
 mexico more 6,000 send it there 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.259
 under study 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 this seems to me somebody in the area when 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.770
 arrived at the first judge the first goal 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 is three minutes from lewandowski game 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.429
 awesome head 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.750
 awesome the bush goldsack o 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.850
 commentator and rightly so 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.600
 It's incredible, let's go, we can not finish it. 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.130
 commencement of judgment 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.929
 lewandowski appears once again there 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.929
 that's not it 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.000
 gain delivery to the bush and lots of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.540
 luck here in the video guilty balance I 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 I wish because I was lucky in the rebound 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.190
 Attention such gains in the midfield has 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.269
 a strong team 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.769
 now in this new moment so if I 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:44.859
 I can handle this this advantage 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:03:02.230
 judged the very good diego lopes 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:03:03.130
 Marcel arrives, that's it. Let's go and win. 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.470
 force 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.260
 only so we chose then in the interval 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.209
 be a good game is the opponent plays well 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.180
 It presses well it tries to go out and play 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.280
 how should it be but I'm on the belt 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.769
 consult many of your attacks 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.049
 Let's see how the start of the game starts. 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:30.120
 see if I can then keep this 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.120
 advantage though ross very well 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.370
 the magazine she pass on the right foot to 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.730
 far post from the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:46.710
 biker there first place 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:57.770
 That's good, the move is the same. 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:57.770
 said who is going will goes 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:07.410
 almost 30 that killed the game despite 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.500
 the great peace tension 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.360
 Frize-if thou the referee is missing 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:21.109
 I do not know if you will sing once you leave. 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.109
 that free on top of the pool 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:42.840
 ios was to ramp up now you already won 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:46.020
 I already wanted to play there I wanted to go track that is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.390
 this is common in file men have 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.270
 pressed is that it is 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:05:02.040
 possible since he got to the goal 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:09.450
 the water will flow to 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:12.660
 defender is going to shaker and 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.880
 beacon pulls to the bath one is way that 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.450
 you made an incredible mistake 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.270
 Calm today, lopes can still check 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.000
 much goes incredible pichek looks the example 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.470
 diego lopez 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.580
 I do not believe either the pet is in the ball. 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.620
 He failed to drop it and how it should be 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.410
 ball in the foot and I enjoy it very well 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.419
 large format and take advantage of 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.380
 defensive mistake of mine that should not have 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.380
 happened there 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:55.740
 fashion was seeking deliver marcel 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.740
 cat bath vote google docs oh no 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:06.669
 as the markowitz even ended up doing the 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.460
 3 1 because then in a play of 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.120
 insistence on cox threw lewandowski 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.550
 load and today it is in another load 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.460
 large donors that 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.870
 suffered a detour and rose do the 3 1 and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:27.849
 mess with the game is awesome 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.860
 the last minutes because the reason why I 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.139
 does not like to make the tie 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.870
 so you certainly will not do this anymore 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.169
 end game good game with lots of 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.759
 gay intensity 2011 in 5 games too 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.960
 it takes new man to play with two 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.300
 goals 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.819
 It is very difficult for a manager here in 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.940
 status in the statistics is 22 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.949
 is the domain of the game is the 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.300
 opponent had another good 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:57.130
 exit play but overall I feel that the 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.099
 3 1 is a result that put the pomegranate 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.479
 There's more the attack, so I go. 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.539
 to accept a proposal for a 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:06.190
 transfer already know if you want 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.409
 will be the next to play with me 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:14.729
 send me a message I 'll have to 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:18.810
 accept the proposal is this only so far 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:20.560
 I only won so far this is in this mine. 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.870
 betting series 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.550
 No one voted for me yet, did you ever notice? 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.699
 so if you want to be the first to 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:32.190
 Knowing what you're thinking to do will only take olic 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.190
 and how in this video and stay here
