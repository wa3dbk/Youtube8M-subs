out<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.000> box<00:03:03.180> too<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> most

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
out of the box too because the most

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.190 
out of the box too because the most
illogical<00:03:04.980> person<00:03:05.609> ever<00:03:05.819> someone<00:03:06.450> who<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
illogical person ever someone who is

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.129 
illogical person ever someone who is
using<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.040> same<00:03:08.370> method<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.269> expect<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
using the same method and expect a

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.589 
using the same method and expect a
different<00:03:10.170> result<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.130> there's<00:03:11.430> no<00:03:11.940> way

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
different result and there's no way

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.349 
different result and there's no way
that's<00:03:13.019> gonna<00:03:13.410> happen<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:14.280> your<00:03:14.730> dreams

that's gonna happen in your dreams

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.360 
that's gonna happen in your dreams
because<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.590> want<00:03:16.859> what<00:03:17.040> you've<00:03:17.160> never

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
because if you want what you've never

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.030 
because if you want what you've never
had<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.970> must<00:03:18.359> be<00:03:18.660> willing<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.410> what

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
had you must be willing to do what

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.069 
had you must be willing to do what
you're<00:03:20.220> never<00:03:20.370> done<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.150> second<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:21.840> is

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
you're never done and the second one is

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.170 
you're never done and the second one is
and<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.459> as<00:03:23.639> one<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> most

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and I think of it as one of the most

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.520 
and I think of it as one of the most
important<00:03:24.630> message<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.079> get<00:03:25.290> from<00:03:25.440> this
