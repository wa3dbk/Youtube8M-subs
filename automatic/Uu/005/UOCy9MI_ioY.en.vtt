which is fairly soon as I guess a few
months<00:01:30.990> also<00:01:31.979> probably<00:01:32.429> January<00:01:32.940> February

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
months also probably January February

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
months also probably January February
but<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.410> highly<00:01:34.830> doubt<00:01:35.130> they'll<00:01:35.340> release<00:01:35.700> um

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.680 
but I highly doubt they'll release um
two<00:01:36.899> products<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.429> same<00:01:38.670> month<00:01:38.940> mainly

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
two products in the same month mainly

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.310 
two products in the same month mainly
because<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:41.450> advertising<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.170> be

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
because of the advertising would just be

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.100 
because of the advertising would just be
too<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.670> pressure<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.909> Apple<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.899> like

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
too much pressure on Apple to like

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.480 
too much pressure on Apple to like
advertise<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.039> much

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
advertise that much

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.609 
advertise that much
and<00:01:48.640> they<00:01:49.119> were<00:01:49.180> gonna<00:01:49.450> have<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> 3-axis

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
and they were gonna have a 3-axis

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.550 
and they were gonna have a 3-axis
gyroscope<00:01:50.829> in<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.659> ipad<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:53.320> play

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
gyroscope in the ipad so you can play

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.210 
gyroscope in the ipad so you can play
more<00:01:54.659> advanced<00:01:55.659> like<00:01:55.990> games<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.740> apps<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
more advanced like games and apps and

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.109 
more advanced like games and apps and
such<00:01:57.399> like<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.700> iphone<00:01:58.180> does<00:01:59.070> make<00:02:00.070> up<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
such like the iphone does make up the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.719 
such like the iphone does make up the
main<00:02:01.450> reason<00:02:02.049> i'm<00:02:02.229> hoping<00:02:02.649> for<00:02:02.890> facetime<00:02:03.460> is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
main reason i'm hoping for facetime is

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.170 
main reason i'm hoping for facetime is
because<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:05.039> face<00:02:06.039> time<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.909> pickup

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
because of face time on that pickup

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.809 
because of face time on that pickup
screen<00:02:07.659> would<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.259> amazing<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.550> only

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
screen would be amazing and the only

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.449 
screen would be amazing and the only
reason<00:02:10.179> i<00:02:10.869> would<00:02:11.200> even<00:02:11.410> think<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.980> getting<00:02:12.190> an

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
reason i would even think of getting an

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.270 
reason i would even think of getting an

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
ipad is if it had facetime so if it does

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.550
