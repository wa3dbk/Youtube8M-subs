wish but I think there's that there's a
more<00:01:13.300> interesting<00:01:14.070> question<00:01:15.070> here<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:18.010> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
more interesting question here and that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.800 
more interesting question here and that
is<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.210> say<00:01:20.730> there<00:01:21.730> are<00:01:21.880> people<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.600> would

that<00:02:35.600> if<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> thought<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.519> sitting

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that if you thought of it as the sitting

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.190
