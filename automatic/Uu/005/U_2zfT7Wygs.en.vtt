far<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.269> occasionally<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.870> Capone's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
far you can occasionally the Capone's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.280 
far you can occasionally the Capone's
like<00:02:16.500> Fabregas<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.280> find<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.939> I<00:02:18.329> don't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
like Fabregas but I find that I don't

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
like Fabregas but I find that I don't
make<00:02:19.500> too<00:02:19.769> much<00:02:19.890> money<00:02:19.950> off<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.700> players<00:02:21.030> like

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
make too much money off of players like

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.289 
make too much money off of players like
Fabregas<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.489> mean<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.969> might<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.269> a

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
Fabregas so I mean that might be a

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.990 
Fabregas so I mean that might be a
fairly<00:02:24.569> decent<00:02:24.719> deal<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.829> I<00:02:25.859> add<00:02:26.519> them<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
fairly decent deal so I add them to the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.780 
fairly decent deal so I add them to the
watch<00:02:27.120> list<00:02:27.480> he's<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.719> goalkeeper<00:02:28.260> from<00:02:28.439> RC<00:02:28.859> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
watch list he's a goalkeeper from RC and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.589 
watch list he's a goalkeeper from RC and
I<00:02:30.659> saw<00:02:30.870> he<00:02:31.079> was<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.500> could<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.890> gone<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.370> 32<00:02:32.939> so

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
I saw he was I could have gone for 32 so

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.849 
I saw he was I could have gone for 32 so
I'm<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.019> put<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.230> 40<00:02:34.500> because

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
I'm just going to put in 40 because

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.199 
I'm just going to put in 40 because
that's<00:02:35.069> how<00:02:35.159> much<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.430> want<00:02:35.579> to<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.849> from<00:02:36.060> him

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.839 
that's how much I want to get from him

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
and I see that that 32 is actually a

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.879 
and I see that that 32 is actually a
fairly<00:02:42.239> decent<00:02:42.450> deal<00:02:42.930> however<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.590> wouldn't

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
fairly decent deal however I wouldn't

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.369 
fairly decent deal however I wouldn't
have<00:02:43.980> made<00:02:44.099> much<00:02:44.159> profit<00:02:44.639> on<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:44.939> so<00:02:45.689> and<00:02:46.109> see
