00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
concepts of graphics you don't see a lot

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.359 
concepts of graphics you don't see a lot
of<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.950> game<00:01:11.450> tutorials<00:01:12.450> online<00:01:13.159> because<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
of like game tutorials online because it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.219 
of like game tutorials online because it
gets<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:14.970> complex<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
gets pretty complex and it's kind of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.980 
gets pretty complex and it's kind of
hard<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.640> know<00:01:17.700> describe<00:01:18.420> everything

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
that's going on so it's going to be

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
that's going on so it's going to be
fairly<00:01:21.000> simple<00:01:21.450> we're<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
fairly simple we're just going to be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.240 
fairly simple we're just going to be
working<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.500> animation<00:01:23.810> simply<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
working with animation simply at this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
working with animation simply at this
time<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.600> time<00:01:27.869> I'm

have for all this good stuff but we're
going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.090> graphics<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.899> we're<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
going to do graphics and we're going to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.120 
going to do graphics and we're going to
say<00:01:43.290> extends<00:01:43.979> activity<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.659> always<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
say extends activity just as always and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.410 
say extends activity just as always and
there<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.729> an<00:01:50.909> import<00:01:52.220> activity

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
there we go we got an import activity

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
there we go we got an import activity
and<00:01:54.420> we're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> oncreate

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and we're going to also do the oncreate

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.800 
and we're going to also do the oncreate
method

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.100 

so<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:01.030> guys<00:02:01.210> should<00:02:01.479> know<00:02:01.630> how<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:01.960> that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
so you guys should know how to do that

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.630 
so you guys should know how to do that
by<00:02:02.290> now<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:07.440> click<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.709> hit<00:02:09.100> OK<00:02:09.459> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
by now and click that and hit OK and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.240 
by now and click that and hit OK and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
then what we're going to do is basically

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.210 
then what we're going to do is basically
set<00:02:12.550> up<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.850> new<00:02:13.090> variable<00:02:13.810> which<00:02:14.440> will<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.190> a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
set up a new variable which will be a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.250 
set up a new variable which will be a
variable<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:15.910> we're<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.330> define<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
variable that we're going to define in a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.390 
variable that we're going to define in a
different<00:02:17.709> class<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> we're<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
different class that we're going to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.100 
different class that we're going to
create<00:02:18.670> ourselves<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:19.660> we're<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.900> call

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
create ourselves so we're going to call

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.080 
create ourselves so we're going to call
this<00:02:20.290> my<00:02:20.770> bring<00:02:21.190> back<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:23.430> again<00:02:24.430> class<00:02:24.790> name

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
this my bring back and again class name

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.550 
this my bring back and again class name
should<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.390> uppercase<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.110> we're<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> do

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
should be uppercase so we're going to do

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.210 
should be uppercase so we're going to do
my<00:02:26.800> bring<00:02:27.190> back<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:29.100> we're<00:02:30.100> going

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
my bring back like this and we're going

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.979 
my bring back like this and we're going
to<00:02:30.280> call<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.760> our<00:02:31.090> view<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.510> name<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
to call this our view that's the name of

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.600 
to call this our view that's the name of
the<00:02:35.110> view<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.340> type<00:02:36.580> of

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the view and this is the type of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.770 
the view and this is the type of
variable<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.450> is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
variable it is

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.150 
variable it is
right<00:02:38.230> now<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.470> giving<00:02:38.709> us<00:02:38.830> an<00:02:38.950> error

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
right now it's giving us an error

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.680 
right now it's giving us an error
because<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.700> hey<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.910> don't<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.269> what

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
because it's like hey I don't know what

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.870 
because it's like hey I don't know what
class<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.410> coming<00:02:41.739> from<00:02:41.890> what<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:42.820> you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
class this is coming from what are you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.550 
class this is coming from what are you
talking<00:02:43.300> about<00:02:43.480> we're<00:02:44.050> going<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.200> define<00:02:44.530> that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
talking about we're going to define that

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.860 
talking about we're going to define that
in<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> next<00:02:45.190> tutorial<00:02:45.400> but<00:02:46.390> basically<00:02:46.660> what

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
in the next tutorial but basically what

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.240 
in the next tutorial but basically what
we're<00:02:46.989> doing<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.260> we're<00:02:47.470> setting<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.890> our<00:02:48.040> own

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
we're doing is we're setting up our own

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.009 
we're doing is we're setting up our own
custom<00:02:48.940> view<00:02:49.239> that's<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.720> hold<00:02:49.930> our

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
custom view that's going to hold our

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.930 
custom view that's going to hold our
animation<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.250> now<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.519> we're<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.760> do

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
animation so now what we're going to do

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.250 
animation so now what we're going to do
is<00:02:52.060> say<00:02:52.209> our<00:02:53.610> view<00:02:54.610> which<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.810> variable

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
is say our view which is that variable

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.690 
is say our view which is that variable
we<00:02:56.410> set<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:57.069> work<00:02:57.220> within<00:02:57.459> this

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
we set up that can work within this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.440 
we set up that can work within this
whole<00:02:57.910> class<00:02:58.180> we're<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.019> say<00:02:59.200> new<00:03:00.450> my

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
whole class we're going to say new my

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.240 
whole class we're going to say new my
bring<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:05.560> we're<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.890> pass

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
bring back and then we're going to pass

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.800 
bring back and then we're going to pass
in<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:09.070> again<00:03:09.459> as<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.970> now<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.570> means

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
in this so again as of now this means

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.900 
in this so again as of now this means
nothing<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.980> computer<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.670> what's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
nothing the computer is like what's

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.930 
nothing the computer is like what's
going<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.239> you're<00:03:13.480> confusing<00:03:14.019> me<00:03:14.140> going<00:03:14.680> crazy

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
going on you're confusing me going crazy

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.370 
going on you're confusing me going crazy
but<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.360> it's<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.900> all<00:03:17.019> work<00:03:17.049> out

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
but you know it's going to all work out

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.509 
but you know it's going to all work out
here<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.130> we're<00:03:18.220> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.400> say

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
here so we're going to say

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.180 
here so we're going to say
setcontentview

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
setcontentview

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.580 
setcontentview
now<00:03:21.190> equal<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.120> our<00:03:22.650> view<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:25.260> there<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:26.410> go<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
now equal to our view and there we go I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.990 
now equal to our view and there we go I
mean<00:03:26.950> we're<00:03:27.100> pretty<00:03:27.280> much<00:03:27.459> done<00:03:27.730> with<00:03:27.910> this
