let's say you get a vert of the sixties
records<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.230> pressed<00:00:31.560> some<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.759> echo<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
records they pressed some with echo and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
records they pressed some with echo and
some<00:00:33.719> without<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.410> bring<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> echo

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
some without you could bring the echo

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.310 
some without you could bring the echo
back<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> unit<00:00:35.870> now<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> coolest

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
back with this unit now the coolest

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.799 
back with this unit now the coolest
thing<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.829> unit<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> display<00:00:38.520> so

thing about this unit to display so

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
thing about this unit to display so
let's<00:00:39.809> plug<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:49.129> look<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.789> turn

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
let's plug it in look at that you turn

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.810 
let's plug it in look at that you turn
the<00:00:51.120> knob<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.230> gets<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.590> bit

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
the knob and it gets a little bit

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.950 
the knob and it gets a little bit
fuzzier<00:00:53.840> it's<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> hologram<00:00:55.289> almost<00:00:56.960> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
fuzzier it's like a hologram almost it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.099 
fuzzier it's like a hologram almost it's
crazy<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.940> thing<00:01:00.149> has<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.449> dirty<00:01:00.629> contacts

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
crazy this thing has some dirty contacts

crazy this thing has some dirty contacts
I<00:01:01.260> did<00:01:01.410> test<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> already<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> does<00:01:02.309> work<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
I did test it already it does work just

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
I did test it already it does work just
fine<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.350> dirty<00:01:04.500> contacts<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
fine I just have some dirty contacts in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
fine I just have some dirty contacts in
the<00:01:05.189> volume<00:01:05.489> knob<00:01:05.670> mainly<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.750> switches

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the volume knob mainly these switches

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
the volume knob mainly these switches
here<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.979> power<00:01:08.100> switch<00:01:08.689> this<00:01:09.689> one

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
here and the power switch this one

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.700 
here and the power switch this one
however<00:01:10.260> seems<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.799> fine<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:12.710> very

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
however seems just fine down here very

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
however seems just fine down here very
interesting<00:01:13.770> we'll<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.369> unit<00:01:17.240> show<00:01:18.240> I'll<00:01:18.420> come

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
interesting we'll do unit show I'll come

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
interesting we'll do unit show I'll come
up<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.830> your

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
up at the back of it so you have your

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
up at the back of it so you have your
basic<00:01:23.250> input<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.880> outputs<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.299> there

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
basic input and outputs right there

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
basic input and outputs right there
there's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> ground<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> guess<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
there's a ground here I guess if you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
there's a ground here I guess if you
wanted<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> put<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> record<00:01:27.330> player<00:01:27.450> through

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
wanted to put a record player through

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.850 
wanted to put a record player through
this<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.650> through<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this thing and then put it through the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.640 
this thing and then put it through the
phone<00:01:29.509> or<00:01:30.509> through<00:01:30.570> tape<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.409> whatever

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
phone or through tape or whatever

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.890 
phone or through tape or whatever
there's<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:33.060> looks<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.479> mill<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
there's also it looks like was mill a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
there's also it looks like was mill a
designed<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.320> tape<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.890> there's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
designed for tape because there's a a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.530 
designed for tape because there's a a
and<00:01:35.909> B<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> tape<00:01:37.880> has<00:01:38.880> two<00:01:39.090> outlets<00:01:39.360> on

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and B for the tape has two outlets on

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
and B for the tape has two outlets on
the<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> max<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:42.290> 300<00:01:44.060> volt

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the back you can do a max of 300 volt

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
the back you can do a max of 300 volt
amps<00:01:45.479> which<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> watts<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.950> can't

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
amps which i think is watts I can't

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.469 
amps which i think is watts I can't
remember<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> single<00:01:50.939> fuse<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
remember it's got a single fuse and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.490 
remember it's got a single fuse and
we're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> look<00:01:52.110> inside<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we're going to take a look inside of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
we're going to take a look inside of
them<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> let's<00:01:54.920> unplug<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> again<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
them so let's unplug it again so I can

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.770 
them so let's unplug it again so I can
get<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> cord<00:01:59.009> through

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
get the cord through

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840 
get the cord through
now<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.020> thing<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.680> it's<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:03.100> literally

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
now what this thing is it's a literally

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.859 
now what this thing is it's a literally
a<00:02:03.880> spring<00:02:04.300> reverb<00:02:04.510> in<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.870> box<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.479> what<00:02:10.630> we<00:02:10.720> have

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
a spring reverb in a box so what we have

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.260 
a spring reverb in a box so what we have
here<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.230> similar<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.740> guitar<00:02:12.130> amp<00:02:12.340> if

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
here it's similar to a guitar amp if

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.810 
here it's similar to a guitar amp if
you're<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.540> look<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.780> here<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:15.220> Springs<00:02:15.640> in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
you're to look in here there Springs in

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.850 
you're to look in here there Springs in
there<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.209> have<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> similar<00:02:17.170> box<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.740> bottom

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
there I have a similar box on the bottom

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.390 
there I have a similar box on the bottom
of<00:02:18.070> my<00:02:18.190> tube<00:02:18.430> guitar<00:02:18.790> amp<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.190> have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
of my tube guitar amp and there you have

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790 
of my tube guitar amp and there you have
it<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.730> it's<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:22.959> modular<00:02:23.470> as<00:02:23.590> most

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
it and it's just as modular as most

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800 
it and it's just as modular as most
other<00:02:23.950> Sansui<00:02:24.430> pieces<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> equipment<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.450> of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
other Sansui pieces of equipment and of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.920 
other Sansui pieces of equipment and of
course<00:02:26.080> there's<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.150> mechanism<00:02:28.150> for<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.390> for

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
course there's the mechanism for the for

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.720 
course there's the mechanism for the for
the<00:02:28.990> front<00:02:29.200> display<00:02:29.320> literally<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.520> moves

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the front display literally just moves

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.220 
the front display literally just moves
it<00:02:30.850> back<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.209> forth<00:02:33.750> yeah<00:02:34.750> all<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.320> does<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.860> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
it back and forth yeah all it does is a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.560 
it back and forth yeah all it does is a
yeah<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> knob<00:02:38.500> turns<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.400> this

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
yeah the knob turns for this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.030 
yeah the knob turns for this
potentiometer<00:02:40.570> here<00:02:40.780> which<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.739> course<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
potentiometer here which of course is

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.770 
potentiometer here which of course is
connected<00:02:42.400> down<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.820> spring<00:02:43.060> reverb<00:02:43.390> so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
connected down to the spring reverb so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.600 
connected down to the spring reverb so
the<00:02:44.200> audio<00:02:44.530> signal<00:02:44.860> goes<00:02:44.980> through<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the audio signal goes through that and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.870 
the audio signal goes through that and
this<00:02:46.450> potentiometer<00:02:46.840> just<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.160> know<00:02:48.280> lets

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this potentiometer just you know lets

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.259 
this potentiometer just you know lets
more<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.209> signal<00:02:49.450> through<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:51.269> tied

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
more of that signal through and tied

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.130 
more of that signal through and tied
into<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.530> core<00:02:53.800> which<00:02:54.220> moves<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
into that is this core which moves the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.180 
into that is this core which moves the
display<00:02:56.140> back<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.500> forth<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.830> front<00:02:57.100> for

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
display back and forth on the front for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.810 
display back and forth on the front for
the<00:02:57.310> hologram<00:02:59.400> there's<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.459> little<00:03:00.670> tiny

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the hologram there's a little tiny

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.250 
the hologram there's a little tiny
Sansui<00:03:01.420> transformer<00:03:01.930> right<00:03:02.050> there<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.260> as

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
Sansui transformer right there and as

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.420 
Sansui transformer right there and as
you<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.830> board's<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.220> still

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
you can see the board's are still

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.550 
you can see the board's are still
modular<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> Sancerre<00:03:07.959> Eastern<00:03:08.230> 50

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
modular like in the Sancerre Eastern 50

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.640 
modular like in the Sancerre Eastern 50
a<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> sense<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:10.620> ad<00:03:11.620> 999<00:03:13.019> um<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:17.380> looks

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
a and in the sense we ad 999 um it looks

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.620 
a and in the sense we ad 999 um it looks
like<00:03:17.860> down<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:21.060> somewhere<00:03:22.060> down<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.360> here<00:03:22.570> I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
like down there somewhere down in here I

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.940 
like down there somewhere down in here I
don't<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.110> box<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.739> think

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
don't know what that box is I think

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.150 
don't know what that box is I think
that's<00:03:24.160> oh<00:03:24.579> those<00:03:24.970> are<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> switches<00:03:26.160> getting

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
that's oh those are the switches getting

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.740 
that's oh those are the switches getting
to<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.370> contacts<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.970> those<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.420> going<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> be

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
to the contacts on those is going to be

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.400 
to the contacts on those is going to be
a<00:03:28.780> bastard<00:03:29.370> Wow<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.690> there<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> bottom<00:03:32.079> cover

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
a bastard Wow is there a bottom cover

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.970 
a bastard Wow is there a bottom cover
yes<00:03:32.860> there<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.220> okay<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.780> there's<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.620> bottom

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
yes there is okay so there's a bottom

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.319 
yes there is okay so there's a bottom
cover<00:03:36.190> right<00:03:36.459> there<00:03:36.489> right<00:03:37.030> where<00:03:37.150> all<00:03:37.239> the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
cover right there right where all the

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.880 
cover right there right where all the
switches<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.660> crap<00:03:37.930> are<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.440> should<00:03:38.769> be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
switches and crap are so I should be

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.759 
switches and crap are so I should be
able<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.100> get<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.370> those<00:03:39.549> without<00:03:39.730> an<00:03:39.970> issue

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
able to get to those without an issue

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.600 
able to get to those without an issue
cool<00:03:43.769> all<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:44.950> thing<00:03:45.160> needs<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.459> some

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
cool all this thing needs is some

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.069 
cool all this thing needs is some
contact<00:03:46.000> cleaning<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.959> go

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
contact cleaning and it's good to go

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.990 
contact cleaning and it's good to go
it's<00:03:47.350> everything<00:03:47.769> still<00:03:48.010> works<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:48.370> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's everything still works all the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's everything still works all the
capacitors<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.600> here<00:03:49.810> still<00:03:50.110> good<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:53.829> for

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
capacitors on here still good so for

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.550 
capacitors on here still good so for
maybe<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.370> one<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.019> what<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.320> I

never seen it before yeah all these

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.680 
never seen it before yeah all these
capacitors<00:04:10.510> look<00:04:10.690> good<00:04:10.900> there's<00:04:11.109> no<00:04:11.500> bulges

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
capacitors look good there's no bulges

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.170 
capacitors look good there's no bulges
they're<00:04:13.440> not<00:04:13.590> bulging<00:04:14.160> none<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:14.970> them<00:04:15.090> are

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
they're not bulging none of them are

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.520 
they're not bulging none of them are
vented<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:15.660> anything<00:04:17.330> even<00:04:18.330> these<00:04:18.540> these<00:04:19.320> look

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
vented or anything even these these look

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.410 
vented or anything even these these look
good<00:04:19.680> down<00:04:20.250> here<00:04:20.280> all<00:04:20.610> these<00:04:20.790> these<00:04:21.150> look<00:04:21.330> a

good down here all these these look a
little<00:04:21.600> these<00:04:22.530> look<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> little<00:04:22.770> fat<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.430> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
little these look a little fat but I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
little these look a little fat but I
think<00:04:23.790> that's<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.210> way<00:04:24.300> they're

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
think that's just the way they're

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.840 
think that's just the way they're
supposed<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.930> be<00:04:25.110> not<00:04:26.010> some<00:04:26.160> transistors<00:04:26.520> here

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
supposed to be not some transistors here

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.000 
supposed to be not some transistors here
and<00:04:27.030> there<00:04:27.560> it's<00:04:28.560> an<00:04:28.710> interesting

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
and there it's an interesting

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.010 
and there it's an interesting
interesting<00:04:29.550> unit<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.210> mean<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.510> got<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:30.870> a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
interesting unit I mean it's got it's a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.730 
interesting unit I mean it's got it's a
filtering<00:04:31.530> stage<00:04:31.770> there<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.560> that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
filtering stage there so you know that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.200 
filtering stage there so you know that
whole<00:04:34.890> circuitry<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.670> for<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.850> inputs

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
whole circuitry is just for the inputs

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.660 
whole circuitry is just for the inputs
back<00:04:36.960> here

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
back here

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.940 
back here
so<00:04:38.670> just<00:04:39.360> inputs<00:04:39.750> take<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.020> lot<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.350> circuitry

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
so just inputs take a lot of circuitry

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.300 
so just inputs take a lot of circuitry
to<00:04:41.240> equalize<00:04:42.240> properly<00:04:42.890> looks<00:04:43.890> like<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.160> has

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
to equalize properly looks like it has

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.910 
to equalize properly looks like it has
two<00:04:44.580> fuses<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.300> as<00:04:45.390> well

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
two fuses in it as well

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.370 
two fuses in it as well
as<00:04:46.920> well<00:04:47.190> as<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.600> power<00:04:48.870> fuse<00:04:49.140> on<00:04:49.290> the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
as well as the the power fuse on the

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.570 
as well as the the power fuse on the
back<00:04:49.910> just<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.000> case<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:52.310> well<00:04:53.310> that's<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
back just in case the well that's the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.620 
back just in case the well that's the
main<00:04:53.760> views<00:04:54.120> for<00:04:54.960> power<00:04:55.200> period<00:04:56.360> just<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.450> case

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
main views for power period just in case

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.470 
main views for power period just in case
you<00:04:57.720> get<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:57.930> surge<00:04:59.180> but<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.360> you're

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
you get a little surge but that you're

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.150 
you get a little surge but that you're
have<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.910> Sansui<00:05:04.160> reverberation

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
have it that is a Sansui reverberation

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.900 
have it that is a Sansui reverberation
amplifier<00:05:05.610> model<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.720> 500<00:05:07.650> now<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.730> you

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
amplifier model are a 500 now if you

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.250 
amplifier model are a 500 now if you
want<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.240> know<00:05:09.360> what<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.750> these<00:05:09.900> sounds

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
want to know what one of these sounds

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.690 
want to know what one of these sounds
like<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.710> happen<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.190> guitar<00:05:11.370> amp

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
like if you happen to have a guitar amp

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.330 
like if you happen to have a guitar amp
that<00:05:11.910> has<00:05:12.000> spring<00:05:12.330> reverb<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.040> like<00:05:14.040> for

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
that has spring reverb in it like for

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.030 
that has spring reverb in it like for
example<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:14.790> tube<00:05:15.030> guitar<00:05:15.780> amp<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.710> turn<00:05:16.890> your

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
example a tube guitar amp just turn your

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.530 
example a tube guitar amp just turn your
reverb<00:05:17.430> all<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.730> way<00:05:17.850> up<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.240> play<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.450> few

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
reverb all the way up and play a few

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.300 
reverb all the way up and play a few
chords<00:05:18.720> that's<00:05:19.260> exactly<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.890> same<00:05:20.040> effect

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
chords that's exactly the same effect

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.680 
chords that's exactly the same effect
you<00:05:20.370> get<00:05:20.550> out<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.790> this<00:05:20.910> thing<00:05:21.150> except<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.570> be

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
you get out of this thing except to be

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.250 
you get out of this thing except to be
running<00:05:21.930> music<00:05:22.290> through<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.590> instead<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
running music through it instead and it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.840 
running music through it instead and it
sounds<00:05:25.590> great<00:05:25.770> especially<00:05:26.160> with<00:05:26.490> some<00:05:26.700> of<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
sounds great especially with some of the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.620 
sounds great especially with some of the
sixties<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.900> sixties<00:05:28.260> rock<00:05:28.500> where<00:05:28.710> they

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
sixties the sixties rock where they

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.670 
sixties the sixties rock where they
didn't<00:05:30.630> put<00:05:30.750> echo<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.200> background<00:05:31.560> for

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
didn't put echo in the background for

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.710 
didn't put echo in the background for
some<00:05:31.830> reason<00:05:32.190> on<00:05:32.310> some<00:05:33.000> records<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.510> did<00:05:33.630> on

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
some reason on some records and did on

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.710 
some reason on some records and did on
the<00:05:33.810> others<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:35.390> don't<00:05:36.390> know<00:05:36.450> if<00:05:36.600> I'll<00:05:36.690> be

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
the others so I don't know if I'll be

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.330 
the others so I don't know if I'll be
keeping<00:05:37.080> this<00:05:37.170> thing<00:05:37.230> it<00:05:37.590> might<00:05:37.770> go<00:05:37.920> on<00:05:38.010> eBay

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
keeping this thing it might go on eBay

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.750 
keeping this thing it might go on eBay
at<00:05:38.760> some<00:05:39.300> point<00:05:39.800> just<00:05:40.800> because<00:05:42.050> I'm<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.760> don't

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
at some point just because I'm I don't

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.310 
at some point just because I'm I don't
have<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.910> use<00:05:45.090> for<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.390> but<00:05:45.570> I'm<00:05:45.660> not<00:05:45.780> sure<00:05:46.050> if<00:05:46.200> I

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
have a use for it but I'm not sure if I

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.890 
have a use for it but I'm not sure if I
don't<00:05:46.560> it's<00:05:46.770> it's<00:05:47.040> kind<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.490> weird<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:48.570> uses

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
don't it's it's kind of weird the uses

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.620 
don't it's it's kind of weird the uses
for<00:05:49.080> these<00:05:49.200> seem<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.800> be<00:05:49.950> very<00:05:50.160> specific<00:05:50.520> and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.620 

so<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:55.410> know<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.850> mean<00:05:56.850> I'm<00:05:57.000> not<00:05:57.150> sure<00:05:57.210> where<00:05:57.600> I

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
so you know I mean I'm not sure where I

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.730 
so you know I mean I'm not sure where I
could<00:05:57.900> use<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:58.170> if<00:05:58.290> I<00:05:58.530> could<00:05:58.590> use<00:05:58.860> it<00:05:58.980> at<00:05:59.100> all

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
could use it if I could use it at all

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.350 
could use it if I could use it at all
what<00:06:01.740> I'm<00:06:01.860> but<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.310> had<00:06:02.490> an<00:06:02.580> idea<00:06:02.850> for<00:06:02.910> was<00:06:03.240> to

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
what I'm but I had an idea for was to

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.500 
what I'm but I had an idea for was to
use<00:06:03.540> this<00:06:04.490> let's<00:06:05.490> say<00:06:05.670> I<00:06:05.700> wanted<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.060> transfer

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
use this let's say I wanted to transfer

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.960 
use this let's say I wanted to transfer
a<00:06:06.540> record<00:06:07.280> let's<00:06:08.280> say<00:06:10.460> she's<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.490> woman<00:06:11.700> by<00:06:11.910> the

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
a record let's say she's a woman by the

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.520 
a record let's say she's a woman by the
Beatles<00:06:12.360> where<00:06:12.600> they<00:06:12.750> did<00:06:12.930> have<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.170> version

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
Beatles where they did have a version

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.340 
Beatles where they did have a version
with<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.100> without<00:06:14.340> echo<00:06:14.670> I<00:06:14.930> could<00:06:15.930> record<00:06:16.230> it

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
with and without echo I could record it

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.470 
with and without echo I could record it
virgin<00:06:17.070> without<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.460> echo<00:06:17.730> then<00:06:18.120> turn<00:06:18.330> this

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
virgin without the echo then turn this

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.020 
virgin without the echo then turn this
all<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.720> way<00:06:18.810> up<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:19.310> do<00:06:20.310> a<00:06:20.340> version<00:06:20.850> with<00:06:21.000> the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
all the way up and do a version with the

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.030 
all the way up and do a version with the
echo<00:06:21.479> so<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.080> could<00:06:22.260> transfer<00:06:22.470> two<00:06:22.800> different

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
echo so I could transfer two different

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.650 
echo so I could transfer two different
versions<00:06:23.400> one<00:06:23.580> would<00:06:23.729> simulate<00:06:24.240> one<00:06:24.510> with

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
versions one would simulate one with

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.029 
versions one would simulate one with
spring<00:06:24.960> reverb<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:25.410> one<00:06:25.500> without<00:06:25.620> it

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
spring reverb and one without it

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.489 
spring reverb and one without it
but<00:06:26.969> of<00:06:27.059> course<00:06:27.089> the<00:06:27.479> one<00:06:27.599> that's<00:06:27.779> from<00:06:27.990> that

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499 
but of course the one that's from that

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.049 
but of course the one that's from that
was<00:06:28.619> mixed<00:06:28.949> with<00:06:29.159> the<00:06:29.279> reword<00:06:29.550> sounds<00:06:29.879> a<00:06:29.939> lot

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
was mixed with the reword sounds a lot

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.359 
was mixed with the reword sounds a lot
better<00:06:30.300> but<00:06:30.479> you<00:06:30.599> can<00:06:30.889> accommodate<00:06:31.889> that<00:06:32.099> with

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:32.369 
better but you can accommodate that with

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.309 
better but you can accommodate that with
this<00:06:32.550> now<00:06:32.759> having<00:06:33.569> said<00:06:33.930> that<00:06:33.960> it's<00:06:34.259> still

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
this now having said that it's still

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.839 
this now having said that it's still
kind<00:06:34.619> of<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:34.740> half-assed<00:06:35.099> way<00:06:35.249> to<00:06:35.309> do<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.639> but

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
kind of a half-assed way to do it but

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.540 
kind of a half-assed way to do it but
it's<00:06:36.479> just<00:06:37.139> kind<00:06:37.319> of<00:06:37.349> cool<00:06:37.559> toy<00:06:37.770> that's<00:06:38.249> all
