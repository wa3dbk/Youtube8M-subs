file<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.270> will<00:01:39.420> burn<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> DVD<00:01:41.100> but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
file and it will burn that to a DVD but

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
file and it will burn that to a DVD but
first<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.329> some<00:01:42.479> things<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.799> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
first are some things that we can do we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
first are some things that we can do we
can<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.790> into<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> inspector<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
can go into the inspector here and with

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.749 
can go into the inspector here and with
this<00:01:47.130> job<00:01:47.520> selected<00:01:48.619> we<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> job

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
this job selected we can go to job

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.690 
this job selected we can go to job
action<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> bunch<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> changes<00:01:52.700> when

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
action and make a bunch of changes when

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
action and make a bunch of changes when
the<00:01:53.939> job<00:01:54.450> completes<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.170> create<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> DVD

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the job completes we can create a DVD

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
the job completes we can create a DVD
that's<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.030> output

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that's what we want to do the output

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.209 
that's what we want to do the output

I can remove it with the M and that will

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.849 
I can remove it with the M and that will
add<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.239> chapter<00:03:09.480> called<00:03:09.659> chapter<00:03:10.019> one<00:03:10.319> chapter

a text edit as a plain text file and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.460 
a text edit as a plain text file and
it's<00:03:23.909> just<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> timecode<00:03:24.629> followed<00:03:25.319> by<00:03:25.409> space

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
it's just the timecode followed by space

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's just the timecode followed by space
followed<00:03:25.889> by<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.129> name<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> chapter<00:03:27.030> it's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.449 
followed by the name of the chapter it's
this<00:03:27.299> allows<00:03:27.720> me<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.930> actually<00:03:28.229> use<00:03:28.319> real

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
this allows me to actually use real

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.099 
this allows me to actually use real
chapter<00:03:29.459> name<00:03:29.669> so<00:03:29.849> I'll<00:03:29.939> open<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
can see it places the chapter markers

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.580 
can see it places the chapter markers
automatically<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.439> I've<00:03:34.560> got

actually burn the disk what I would do

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.569 
actually burn the disk what I would do
then<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.689> go<00:03:45.959> move<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.919> inspector<00:03:47.400> over

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
then is to go move the inspector over

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.149 
submit button and when I hit submit it
will<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:52.859> start<00:03:53.930> building<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.229> DVD<00:03:55.590> but

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
will actually start building the DVD but

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.039 
will actually start building the DVD but
first<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.939> to<00:03:57.209> see<00:03:57.419> what's<00:03:57.569> going<00:03:57.629> on<00:03:57.810> and

to name the the batch process that's not

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.409 
to name the the batch process that's not
important<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:05.699> it's<00:04:05.909> only<00:04:06.030> important<00:04:06.329> if

see<00:04:11.759> it's<00:04:11.879> actually<00:04:12.209> creating<00:04:12.689> this<00:04:12.810> DVD<00:04:13.290> here

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
see it's actually creating this DVD here

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.930 
see it's actually creating this DVD here
and<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:15.000> going<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.389> build<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.109> first

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
and it's going to build it first

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.580 
and it's going to build it first
exporting<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> video<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.599> then<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.289> audio

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
exporting the video and then the audio

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.269 
exporting the video and then the audio
and<00:04:19.889> then<00:04:19.979> building<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.400> DVD<00:04:21.889> so<00:04:22.889> you<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.159> see

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
and then building a DVD so you can see

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.190 
and then building a DVD so you can see
it's<00:04:23.460> asked<00:04:23.639> me<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.969> insert<00:04:24.330> disk<00:04:25.050> could

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
it's asked me to insert disk could

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.230 
it's asked me to insert disk could
actually<00:04:25.370> open<00:04:26.370> up<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> drive

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
actually open up the drive

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.420 
actually open up the drive
and<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.840> can<00:04:28.020> insert<00:04:28.259> a<00:04:28.319> DVD<00:04:28.770> now<00:04:28.949> and<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> will

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and I can insert a DVD now and it will

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.700 
and I can insert a DVD now and it will
burn<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:30.150> disc<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:30.539> me<00:04:30.569> so<00:04:31.319> that's<00:04:31.500> how<00:04:31.650> you

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
burn the disc for me so that's how you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.830 
burn the disc for me so that's how you
use<00:04:31.800> compressor<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.490> create<00:04:32.789> simple<00:04:33.090> DVDs<00:04:33.569> now

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
use compressor to create simple DVDs now

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600 
use compressor to create simple DVDs now
it's<00:04:33.960> nothing<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.380> what<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.590> didi<00:04:35.099> used<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.490> do

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
it's nothing like what I didi used to do

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.640 
it's nothing like what I didi used to do
I<00:04:35.789> mean<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.240> used<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.750> have<00:04:36.930> menus<00:04:37.440> and

I mean you just used to have menus and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.809 
I mean you just used to have menus and
you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.919> create<00:04:38.160> all<00:04:38.340> sorts<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.669> different

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
you can create all sorts of different

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.640 
you can create all sorts of different
layers<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.389> complexity<00:04:39.840> with<00:04:40.229> images<00:04:40.620> and

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
slideshows and all sorts of stuff but

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.839 
slideshows and all sorts of stuff but
you<00:04:43.139> know<00:04:43.169> compressor<00:04:43.680> will<00:04:43.889> get<00:04:44.069> your<00:04:44.220> stuff

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849
