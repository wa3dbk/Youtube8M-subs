first I want to mention that this is the
first<00:00:17.220> release<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.820> app<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> they<00:00:18.690> have

first release of this app and they have

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.189 
first release of this app and they have
planned<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.740> add<00:00:19.890> more<00:00:20.640> video<00:00:20.970> more<00:00:21.660> training

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
planned to add more video more training

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.519 
planned to add more video more training
cycles<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.240> just<00:00:24.240> generally<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> app

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
cycles and just generally make the app
more<00:00:25.859> user-friendly<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.480> can

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
more user-friendly as well so you can

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.820 
more user-friendly as well so you can
probably<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.109> forward<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> an<00:00:28.560> Android

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
probably look forward to an Android

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.820 
probably look forward to an Android
version<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.369> well<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:29.970> future

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
version as well in your future

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.370 
version as well in your future
so<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> click<00:00:33.059> setup<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
so as we go to click setup we see that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
so as we go to click setup we see that
we're<00:00:34.559> faced<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.309> three<00:00:35.940> options<00:00:36.059> here

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
we're faced with three options here

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
we're faced with three options here
beginner<00:00:36.840> intermediate<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.559> advanced<00:00:38.129> and

beginner intermediate and advanced and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
beginner intermediate and advanced and
these<00:00:39.000> correspond<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> levels<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> psycho

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
these correspond to the levels of psycho

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
these correspond to the levels of psycho
programming<00:00:41.790> based<00:00:42.030> off<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> inputs<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the app things like your weight your 1

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
the app things like your weight your 1
rep<00:00:49.379> max<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.149> based<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.809> will

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
rep max is and based off of that it will

custom training myself and the problem

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
custom training myself and the problem
is<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> workout<00:01:40.950> by

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is that you have to go and workout by

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
is that you have to go and workout by
workout<00:01:41.159> basis<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.500> change<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> exercise

that you're doing so the process can be

that you're doing so the process can be
a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.409> time-consuming<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:51.000> we're

playing around with the notes as well

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.580 
playing around with the notes as well
and<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> notes<00:04:19.320> will<00:04:19.560> add<00:04:19.770> all<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.460> workout

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
putting that in and like I mentioned

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.399 
putting that in and like I mentioned
before<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.529> would<00:06:11.650> have<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:12.389> input<00:06:13.389> your<00:06:13.419> your

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
before you would have to input your your

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.860 
before you would have to input your your
variables<00:06:14.919> every<00:06:15.069> single<00:06:15.550> day<00:06:15.699> if<00:06:16.509> I<00:06:16.659> wanted

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
variables every single day if I wanted

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.600 
variables every single day if I wanted
to<00:06:16.960> make<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.110> system-wide<00:06:17.560> change<00:06:18.039> to<00:06:18.310> squats

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
to make a system-wide change to squats

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.369 
to make a system-wide change to squats
for<00:06:18.729> front<00:06:19.060> squats<00:06:19.330> for<00:06:19.539> a<00:06:19.569> full<00:06:19.779> cycle<00:06:20.050> I

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
for front squats for a full cycle I

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.959 
for front squats for a full cycle I
would<00:06:20.800> have<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:20.979> change<00:06:21.219> that<00:06:21.370> on<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.580> workout

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
would have to change that on a workout

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:27.179 
would have to change that on a workout
by<00:06:22.150> workout<00:06:22.180> basis<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:25.270> my<00:06:25.659> review<00:06:25.810> in<00:06:26.289> total

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
by workout basis so my review in total

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:28.890 
by workout basis so my review in total
is<00:06:27.639> that<00:06:27.849> if<00:06:27.969> you're<00:06:28.089> running<00:06:28.240> psycho<00:06:28.659> or<00:06:28.839> if

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
is that if you're running psycho or if

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.559 
is that if you're running psycho or if
