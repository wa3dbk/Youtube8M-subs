00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.750 

in<00:00:18.570> Maya<00:00:18.779> 2014<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:19.920> new<00:00:20.070> options<00:00:20.580> for

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
in Maya 2014 there are new options for

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
in Maya 2014 there are new options for
the<00:00:20.850> mental<00:00:21.210> ray<00:00:21.359> renderer<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.470> could

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the mental ray renderer and this could

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.080 
the mental ray renderer and this could
save<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.490> there's<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
save some time because there's now a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.910 
save some time because there's now a
single<00:00:24.510> slider<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.230> control<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> overall

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
single slider to control the overall

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640 
single slider to control the overall
render<00:00:26.550> quality<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.720> open<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> render

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
render quality let's open up the render

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
render quality let's open up the render
settings<00:00:28.680> window<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> mental<00:00:30.390> ray

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
settings window and in the mental ray

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
settings window and in the mental ray
quality<00:00:31.260> tab<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.430> there's<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
quality tab you will see that there's a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
quality tab you will see that there's a
new<00:00:32.969> sampling<00:00:33.480> mode<00:00:33.690> unified<00:00:34.440> sampling<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
new sampling mode unified sampling and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
new sampling mode unified sampling and
that's<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> default<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.630> most<00:00:36.809> important

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that's the default the most important

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's the default the most important
attributes<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.710> quality<00:00:38.219> min<00:00:38.700> samples<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
attributes are quality min samples and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.410 
attributes are quality min samples and
max<00:00:39.510> samples<00:00:40.219> quality<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.489> basically<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
max samples quality is basically a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
max samples quality is basically a
contrast<00:00:43.050> threshold<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> low<00:00:44.640> quality

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
contrast threshold with a low quality

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
contrast threshold with a low quality
setting<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.170> will<00:00:46.289> need<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
setting then there will need to be a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
setting then there will need to be a
great<00:00:47.100> deal<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> contrast<00:00:48.090> between<00:00:48.180> adjacent

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
great deal of contrast between adjacent

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
great deal of contrast between adjacent
pixels<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.590> order<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> force<00:00:50.250> additional

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
pixels in order to force additional

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.990 
pixels in order to force additional
samples<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.410> better<00:00:53.000> anti-aliasing

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
samples or to get better anti-aliasing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
samples or to get better anti-aliasing
if<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> quality<00:00:54.899> setting<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.739> high

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
if the quality setting is up really high

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000 
if the quality setting is up really high
then<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:57.059> won't<00:00:57.300> need<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.809> great<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> contrast

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
then we won't need as great of contrast

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
then we won't need as great of contrast
between<00:00:59.100> neighboring<00:00:59.820> pixels<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.510> order<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
between neighboring pixels in order to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.009 
between neighboring pixels in order to
force<00:01:01.289> additional<00:01:02.010> samples<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> min<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.660> Max

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
force additional samples the min and Max

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
force additional samples the min and Max
samples<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.369> currently<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
samples are here and currently with the

samples are here and currently with the
default<00:01:06.990> values<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.250> least<00:01:08.280> one

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
default values we will get at least one

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960 
default values we will get at least one
sample<00:01:09.390> per<00:01:09.420> pixel<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.619> most<00:01:10.860> 100<00:01:11.340> samples

sample per pixel and at most 100 samples
per<00:01:12.450> pixel<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> quality<00:01:14.250> slider

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

is<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.600> low<00:01:15.689> we'll<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.770> never

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
is down pretty low we'll really never

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.390 
is down pretty low we'll really never
reach<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.850> maximum<00:01:18.509> samples<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.770> let's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
reach this maximum samples level let's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800 
reach this maximum samples level let's
go<00:01:20.520> ahead<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> render<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
go ahead and render that and see what it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
go ahead and render that and see what it
looks<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.180> render<00:01:24.180> view<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
looks like go up to render view and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
looks like go up to render view and
here's<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> looks<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.890> default

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
here's what it looks like with default

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
here's what it looks like with default
quality<00:01:26.670> settings<00:01:27.240> I'll<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.810> ahead<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.110> store

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
quality settings I'll go ahead and store

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
quality settings I'll go ahead and store
that<00:01:28.680> image<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.670> compare<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> other

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that image so we can compare it to other

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
that image so we can compare it to other
images<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:32.100> play<00:01:32.280> around<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
images and let's play around with a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
images and let's play around with a
quality<00:01:33.210> setting<00:01:33.540> I'll<00:01:33.689> bring<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
quality setting I'll bring that down to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.060 
quality setting I'll bring that down to
its<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.680> minimum<00:01:35.130> value<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.880> 0.1<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.860> ahead

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
its a minimum value of 0.1 and go ahead

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
its a minimum value of 0.1 and go ahead
and<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.310> another<00:01:38.460> rendering<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.479> render

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and do another rendering in my render

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
and do another rendering in my render
view<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.860> order<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.250> us<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
view and in order for us to see that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
view and in order for us to see that
more<00:01:41.970> clearly<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> zoom<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.530> my

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
more clearly I want to zoom in on my

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
more clearly I want to zoom in on my
desktop<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.659> better

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
desktop just so we can see that better

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.639 
desktop just so we can see that better
so<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> quality<00:01:47.280> setting<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.350> 0.1<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so this is a quality setting of 0.1 and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.210 
so this is a quality setting of 0.1 and
that's<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> quality<00:01:50.729> setting<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> 0.25<00:01:52.220> so

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that's the quality setting of 0.25 so

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.499 
that's the quality setting of 0.25 so
you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.060> difference

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you can see that there is a difference

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can see that there is a difference
there<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:55.140> getting<00:01:55.229> better<00:01:55.820> anti-aliasing

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
there we're getting better anti-aliasing

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
there we're getting better anti-aliasing
with<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> higher<00:01:57.570> quality<00:01:58.170> setting<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.680> 0.25

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
with the higher quality setting of 0.25

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.660 
with the higher quality setting of 0.25
or<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:01.110> them<00:02:01.229> back<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:01.740> I'll<00:02:02.490> go

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
or here see them back out again I'll go

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
or here see them back out again I'll go
ahead<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.820> store<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.479> other<00:02:03.659> image<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
ahead and store that other image if you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.830 
ahead and store that other image if you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
want to do draft quality renderings and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.050 
want to do draft quality renderings and
get<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.380> done<00:02:07.500> quickly<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.849> can

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
get them done quickly then you can

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.680 
get them done quickly then you can
reduce<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.869> min<00:02:10.140> samples<00:02:10.800> below<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.000> min

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
reduce the min samples below one if min

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.490 
reduce the min samples below one if min
samples<00:02:13.200> has<00:02:13.319> a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
fractional value let's say is 0.5 then

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.580 
fractional value let's say is 0.5 then
we<00:02:17.160> will<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:17.850> necessarily<00:02:18.090> get<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.110> sample

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
we will not necessarily get one sample

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.340 
we will not necessarily get one sample
per<00:02:19.620> pixel<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.490> might<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.480> sample<00:02:21.960> every

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
per pixel we might get one sample every

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.400 
per pixel we might get one sample every
4<00:02:22.740> pixels<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.940> case<00:02:24.210> i'll<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:25.080> ahead<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
4 pixels in this case i'll go ahead and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
4 pixels in this case i'll go ahead and
render<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:27.150> starting<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> look<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
render that and it's starting to look a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.540 
render that and it's starting to look a
bit<00:02:27.990> dirtier<00:02:28.500> i'll<00:02:28.800> go<00:02:28.890> ahead<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.070> store<00:02:29.400> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
bit dirtier i'll go ahead and store it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120 
bit dirtier i'll go ahead and store it
and<00:02:29.670> once<00:02:30.330> again<00:02:30.450> zoom<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
and once again zoom in you can see that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.000 
and once again zoom in you can see that
more<00:02:32.400> clearly<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.450> that's<00:02:33.930> with<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.350> min

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
more clearly so that's with a min

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.150 
more clearly so that's with a min
samples<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.640> 0.5<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.680> where<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> min

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
samples of 0.5 and that's where the min

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.510 
samples of 0.5 and that's where the min
samples<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:39.260> one<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
samples of one so you can see the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.120 
samples of one so you can see the
difference<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.090> zoom<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.140> again<00:02:43.320> you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
difference there zoom back out again you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770 
difference there zoom back out again you
can<00:02:44.310> reduce<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> min<00:02:44.970> samples<00:02:45.360> all<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> way

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
can reduce the min samples all the way

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.470 
can reduce the min samples all the way
down<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:45.989> 0.1<00:02:46.910> go<00:02:47.910> ahead<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.360> another

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
down to 0.1 go ahead and do another

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
down to 0.1 go ahead and do another
render<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.160> see<00:02:50.310> it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
render of that and you can see it's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.090 
render of that and you can see it's
looking<00:02:50.730> very<00:02:50.760> blocky<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:52.110> because<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.800> fact

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
looking very blocky here because in fact

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.900 
looking very blocky here because in fact
we're<00:02:53.370> getting<00:02:53.790> one<00:02:54.420> sample<00:02:55.050> every<00:02:55.650> 20<00:02:56.459> pixels

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
we're getting one sample every 20 pixels

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.090 
we're getting one sample every 20 pixels
here<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.840> that's<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.440> very<00:02:58.620> good<00:02:58.860> obviously

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
here so that's not very good obviously

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.590 
here so that's not very good obviously
so<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.790> probably<00:02:59.970> wouldn't<00:03:00.270> want<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.480> ever

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so you probably wouldn't want to ever

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.390 
so you probably wouldn't want to ever
take<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.870> down<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.380> low<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.860> would<00:03:02.130> recommend

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
take it down that low I would recommend

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.340 
take it down that low I would recommend
for<00:03:02.790> draft<00:03:03.120> quality<00:03:03.540> renderings<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.200> is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
for draft quality renderings this is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.770 
for draft quality renderings this is
probably<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.070> sweet<00:03:05.520> spot<00:03:05.880> there's<00:03:06.510> another

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
probably the sweet spot there's another

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.970 
probably the sweet spot there's another
feature<00:03:07.050> here<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.590> want<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.800> mention

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
feature here I just want to mention

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.750 
feature here I just want to mention
which<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.850> progressive<00:03:09.570> mode<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.050> IPR<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.980> of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
which is progressive mode for IPR and of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.610 
which is progressive mode for IPR and of
course<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.150> PR<00:03:12.630> stands<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.080> interactive

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
course I PR stands for interactive

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.350 
course I PR stands for interactive
production<00:03:14.100> rendering<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.730> what

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
production rendering and what

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.080 
production rendering and what
progressive<00:03:15.840> mode<00:03:16.050> does<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.739> basically

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
progressive mode does is it basically

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.820 
progressive mode does is it basically
renders<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.239> passes<00:03:18.810> it'll<00:03:19.110> render<00:03:19.320> kind<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
renders in passes it'll render kind of a

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.610 
renders in passes it'll render kind of a
low<00:03:20.040> quality<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.060> then<00:03:21.540> refine<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
low quality and then refine it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.009 
low quality and then refine it
progressively<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.000> it'll<00:03:24.390> get<00:03:24.540> better<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
progressively so it'll get better and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.259 
progressively so it'll get better and
better<00:03:25.049> quality<00:03:25.500> as<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.310> watch<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.880> render

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
better quality as you watch it render

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.140 
better quality as you watch it render
however<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.739> min<00:03:28.950> samples<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.670> down<00:03:29.910> below

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
however if the min samples is down below

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.680 
however if the min samples is down below
1<00:03:30.810> then<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.650> fact<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.100> will<00:03:32.250> break<00:03:32.610> i<00:03:32.910> PR<00:03:33.239> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
1 then in fact it will break i PR and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.690 
1 then in fact it will break i PR and
IPR<00:03:34.019> won't<00:03:34.320> work<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:34.709> all<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> show
