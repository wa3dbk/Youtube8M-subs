and<00:00:39.380> we're<00:00:39.530> just<00:00:39.590> going<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:39.800> recap<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.370> those

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
and we're just going to recap on those

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.710 
and we're just going to recap on those
because<00:00:40.700> some<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.000> those<00:00:41.059> who<00:00:41.210> talked<00:00:41.450> about

to<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:41.989> large<00:00:42.230> degree<00:00:42.520> obviously<00:00:43.520> we're

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
to a large degree obviously we're

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.430 
to a large degree obviously we're
leading<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.000> bike<00:00:44.149> into<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.480> corner<00:00:44.930> if<00:00:45.290> I

leading the bike into a corner if I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.020 
leading the bike into a corner if I
leave<00:00:45.620> my<00:00:45.739> way<00:00:45.890> inside<00:00:46.370> particular<00:00:46.789> we've<00:00:46.910> got

a slightly off gamble slightly Russia
corner<00:00:48.890> there's<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.609> potential<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:50.329> the

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
corner there's a potential there the

things are going to drift away from you
pretty<00:00:52.280> rapidly<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.879> front<00:00:53.179> wheels<00:00:53.359> going

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
pretty rapidly that front wheels going

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.200 
pretty rapidly that front wheels going
to<00:00:53.629> wash<00:00:53.780> out<00:00:54.550> main<00:00:55.550> thing<00:00:55.699> we<00:00:55.820> need<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.030> think

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
to wash out main thing we need to think

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.939 
to wash out main thing we need to think
about<00:00:56.329> there<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:57.079> when<00:00:57.350> we<00:00:57.440> do<00:00:57.589> lean<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.920> bike

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
about there is when we do lean the bike

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.669 
about there is when we do lean the bike
is<00:00:58.519> making<00:00:58.940> sure<00:00:59.120> our<00:00:59.149> mass<00:00:59.539> and<00:00:59.989> weight<00:01:00.019> stays

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
is making sure our mass and weight stays

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.470 
is making sure our mass and weight stays
over<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.980> center<00:01:01.280> line<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.609> tires<00:01:01.879> and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
over the center line of the tires and

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.759 
over the center line of the tires and
we've<00:01:02.629> looked<00:01:02.780> at<00:01:02.960> out<00:01:03.109> by<00:01:03.289> coming<00:01:03.620> around

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
we've looked at out by coming around

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.270 
we've looked at out by coming around
this<00:01:03.980> side<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.400> saddle<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:06.280> compressing

this side of the saddle and compressing

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.100 
this side of the saddle and compressing
into<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.610> corner<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.330> can<00:01:08.510> make<00:01:08.659> sure<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
into the corner we can make sure the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.420 
into the corner we can make sure the
tires<00:01:09.320> flare<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> bit<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.100> give<00:01:10.280> us<00:01:10.400> some

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
tires flare a bit and give us some

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.910 
tires flare a bit and give us some
traction<00:01:10.850> through<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.390> section<00:01:11.920> so

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
traction through that section so

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.610

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
to lean the bike into the hill slightly

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.830 
to lean the bike into the hill slightly
that<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.370> mass<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.790> pushing<00:03:51.150> down<00:03:51.390> into<00:03:51.780> the

head shoulders and hips looking to where

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.820 
head shoulders and hips looking to where
I<00:03:57.090> want<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.330> go<00:03:57.390> my<00:03:58.020> even<00:03:58.320> turn<00:03:58.500> them<00:03:58.650> slightly

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
I want to go my even turn them slightly

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.740 
I want to go my even turn them slightly
up<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> slope<00:03:59.550> and<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.120> other<00:04:00.300> thing<00:04:00.450> that's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
up the slope and the other thing that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.270 
up the slope and the other thing that's
going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.989> help<00:04:01.110> me<00:04:01.290> get<00:04:01.410> through<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.890> he's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
going to help me get through here he's

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.100 
going to help me get through here he's
not<00:04:02.459> spending<00:04:02.700> two<00:04:03.000> dallying<00:04:03.510> too<00:04:03.690> long<00:04:03.900> on

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
not spending two dallying too long on

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.620 
not spending two dallying too long on
them<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> little<00:04:04.920> bit<00:04:05.100> of<00:04:05.130> momentum

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
them so a little bit of momentum

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.380 
them so a little bit of momentum
certainly<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.660> don't<00:04:06.840> want<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.020> decelerate<00:04:07.320> as

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
certainly I don't want to decelerate as

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.510 
certainly I don't want to decelerate as
so<00:04:09.390> many<00:04:09.600> sections<00:04:10.200> deceleration<00:04:11.160> is<00:04:11.250> not

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
so many sections deceleration is not

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.460 
so many sections deceleration is not
going<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> help<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.060> situation<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:13.200> want<00:04:13.380> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
going to help the situation we want to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.229 
going to help the situation we want to
accelerate<00:04:13.800> through<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.520> so<00:04:14.790> i<00:04:14.820> might<00:04:15.090> be

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
accelerate through here so i might be

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.870 
accelerate through here so i might be
