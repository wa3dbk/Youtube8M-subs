00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.009 

okay<00:00:06.609> basically<00:00:06.850> what<00:00:07.330> I've<00:00:07.450> got<00:00:07.630> here<00:00:07.840> is<00:00:07.899> an

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019 
okay basically what I've got here is an

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.129 
okay basically what I've got here is an
example<00:00:08.410> of<00:00:08.740> a<00:00:08.860> fiddling<00:00:09.849> around<00:00:09.970> with<00:00:10.360> a

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
example of a fiddling around with a

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.040 
example of a fiddling around with a
standard<00:00:11.830> hxt<00:00:13.320> 909<00:00:14.320> gram<00:00:14.590> servo<00:00:15.100> and<00:00:15.900> what<00:00:16.900> I'm

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
standard hxt 909 gram servo and what I'm

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.080 
standard hxt 909 gram servo and what I'm
interested<00:00:17.080> in<00:00:17.560> doing<00:00:17.619> is<00:00:18.039> changing<00:00:18.880> the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
interested in doing is changing the

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.380 
interested in doing is changing the
sweep<00:00:19.599> on<00:00:19.779> this<00:00:20.070> servo<00:00:21.070> I<00:00:21.279> need<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:21.999> use<00:00:22.179> one<00:00:22.210> of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
sweep on this servo I need to use one of

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.499 
sweep on this servo I need to use one of
these<00:00:22.570> for<00:00:22.900> my<00:00:23.050> pen<00:00:23.829> for<00:00:24.279> my<00:00:24.400> camera<00:00:24.820> on<00:00:24.909> my<00:00:24.999> fpv

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
these for my pen for my camera on my fpv

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.290 
these for my pen for my camera on my fpv
plane<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.109> about<00:00:27.009> a<00:00:27.039> 60<00:00:27.489> degree<00:00:27.579> sweep<00:00:28.089> is

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
plane and about a 60 degree sweep is

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.329 
plane and about a 60 degree sweep is
just<00:00:28.480> not<00:00:28.659> getting<00:00:28.989> it<00:00:29.140> for<00:00:29.319> me<00:00:29.380> so<00:00:30.069> I<00:00:30.130> wanted

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
just not getting it for me so I wanted

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.930 
just not getting it for me so I wanted
to<00:00:30.399> go<00:00:30.669> a<00:00:31.179> little<00:00:31.539> bit<00:00:31.749> more<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:33.070> all<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.820> have

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
to go a little bit more and all you have

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.560 
to go a little bit more and all you have
to<00:00:34.030> do<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.300> just<00:00:34.450> add<00:00:34.660> resistors<00:00:36.570> various

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
to do is just add resistors various

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.509 
to do is just add resistors various
values<00:00:38.050> depending<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:38.620> how<00:00:38.920> much<00:00:39.070> sweep<00:00:39.370> you

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
values depending on how much sweep you

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.750 
values depending on how much sweep you
want<00:00:39.760> between<00:00:39.969> the<00:00:40.359> two<00:00:40.570> outer<00:00:40.840> wires<00:00:41.500> on<00:00:41.980> the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
want between the two outer wires on the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.020 
want between the two outer wires on the
pot<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.340> circuit<00:00:45.699> board<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:48.429> I<00:00:48.460> was<00:00:48.879> able

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
pot and the circuit board so I was able

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.569 
pot and the circuit board so I was able
to<00:00:49.149> get<00:00:49.269> about<00:00:49.390> 180<00:00:49.989> degrees<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.500> sweep<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.160> I

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
to get about 180 degrees of sweep and I

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.069 
to get about 180 degrees of sweep and I
went<00:00:51.760> even<00:00:51.850> further<00:00:52.179> with<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.660> couple<00:00:53.019> of

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
went even further with a couple of

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.229 
went even further with a couple of
resistors<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.010> series<00:00:54.039> and<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:56.649> I<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:58.059> get

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
resistors in series and now I can get

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.950 
resistors in series and now I can get
360<00:00:59.170> degree<00:00:59.410> turn<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.210> standard<00:01:01.780> 9

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
360 degree turn out of a standard 9

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.600 
360 degree turn out of a standard 9
grand<00:01:02.350> servo

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.510 

now<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.880> servo<00:01:12.650> mechanically<00:01:13.650> will<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.980> 180

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
now this servo mechanically will do 180

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
now this servo mechanically will do 180
degrees<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.180> no<00:01:15.360> modifications<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.230> you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
degrees with no modifications all you

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.370 
degrees with no modifications all you
need<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> back<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:18.020> add<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
need to do is take the back off add the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
need to do is take the back off add the
resistors<00:01:19.910> but<00:01:20.910> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.120> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.420> more

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
resistors but if you want to go more

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.120 
resistors but if you want to go more
than<00:01:21.750> 180<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.120> gear

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
than 180 then you have to take this gear

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
than 180 then you have to take this gear
the<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.550> servo<00:01:26.910> controller<00:01:27.540> horn

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the one that the servo controller horn

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890 
the one that the servo controller horn
goes<00:01:28.410> on<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.300> see<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
goes on and if you can see there it's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
goes on and if you can see there it's
got<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> little<00:01:31.230> mechanical<00:01:31.820> plastic<00:01:32.820> tab<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
got a little mechanical plastic tab as a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.640 
got a little mechanical plastic tab as a
mechanical<00:01:34.020> stop

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
mechanical stop

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
mechanical stop
you<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> snip<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.060> off<00:01:36.510> otherwise

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you just got to snip that off otherwise

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890 
you just got to snip that off otherwise
your<00:01:37.800> serve<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.190> abide<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.540> won't<00:01:39.750> get

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
your serve will abide and you won't get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.090 
your serve will abide and you won't get
to<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.200> 360<00:01:41.010> degrees<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.560> basically

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to do 360 degrees like that it basically

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.730 
to do 360 degrees like that it basically
just<00:01:47.490> switched<00:01:47.970> from<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.570> 60<00:01:48.990> degree<00:01:49.140> sweep<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
just switched from a 60 degree sweep to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:59.000 
just switched from a 60 degree sweep to
about<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.070> 80<00:01:50.370> degree<00:01:50.460> sweet<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.860> used<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:56.840> 2.2<00:01:58.010> K

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
about an 80 degree sweet I used to 2.2 K

about an 80 degree sweet I used to 2.2 K
ohm<00:01:59.280> eighth<00:01:59.820> watt<00:02:00.300> resistors<00:02:01.260> I<00:02:01.800> use<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
ohm eighth watt resistors I use the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.680 
ohm eighth watt resistors I use the
eighth<00:02:02.220> Watkins<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.420> tidy

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
eighth Watkins are really really tidy

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.750 
eighth Watkins are really really tidy
and<00:02:03.930> there's<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.620> much<00:02:04.770> room<00:02:05.070> inside<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
and there's not much room inside this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.440 
and there's not much room inside this
servo<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.710> 360<00:02:11.280> degree<00:02:11.880> rotation

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.800 
servo to get the 360 degree rotation
like<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.760> put<00:02:14.760> two<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.180> them<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.570> series

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
like that I put two of them in series

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.030 
like that I put two of them in series
I'm<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.200> playing<00:02:19.440> around<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.770> see<00:02:19.920> what

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
I'm just just playing around to see what

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.740 
I'm just just playing around to see what
values<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.640> I'd<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.510> little

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
values on one I'd like to get a little

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.940 
values on one I'd like to get a little
bit<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:22.320> than<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.070> 80<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.780> 75<00:02:28.560> or<00:02:28.800> 80

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
bit more than the 80 there or 75 or 80

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.000 
bit more than the 80 there or 75 or 80
so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.000> need<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> play<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.440> resistor

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so I just need to play with my resistor

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.400 
so I just need to play with my resistor
values<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.400> little<00:02:32.580> bit<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.390> 180<00:02:33.720> 90

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
values a little bit to get the 180 90

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.950 
values a little bit to get the 180 90
each<00:02:34.709> direction
