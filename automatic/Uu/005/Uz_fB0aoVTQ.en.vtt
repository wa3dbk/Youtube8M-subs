welcome<00:00:00.750> bye<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:01.020> FPS<00:00:01.530> girl<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.920> and<00:00:02.129> tend

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
welcome bye guys FPS girl here and tend

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.530 
welcome bye guys FPS girl here and tend
to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.550> unboxing<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.030> intel<00:00:03.449> pentium<00:00:03.629> g3<00:00:04.410> 258

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.700 

so<00:00:12.540> i<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:12.960> processor<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.650> i

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
so i just got this processor so i

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
so i just got this processor so i
decided<00:00:14.009> why<00:00:14.219> not<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.759> unboxing<00:00:15.299> video

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
decided why not just do unboxing video

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
decided why not just do unboxing video
of<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.780> right<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.710> let's<00:00:17.490> take<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> look

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
of it right now so let's take a look

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
of it right now so let's take a look
what's<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> box<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> there's<00:00:20.400> some

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
what's in the box so there's some

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.090 
what's in the box so there's some
plastic<00:00:20.880> over<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.410> processor<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.920> on

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
plastic over here the processor is on

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.870 
plastic over here the processor is on
the<00:00:23.189> top<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.980> they<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> tab<00:00:28.289> open<00:00:28.880> now

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the top and they are the tab open now

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
the top and they are the tab open now
what<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> did<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.130> using

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
what I did is I'm not going to be using

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.819 
what I did is I'm not going to be using
the<00:00:32.460> intel<00:00:32.910> stock<00:00:33.660> heatsink<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the intel stock heatsink because it is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.459 
the intel stock heatsink because it is
pretty<00:00:35.160> crappy<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.719> knowledge<00:00:37.170> when

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
pretty crappy as from my knowledge when

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
pretty crappy as from my knowledge when
I<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.770> looked<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.040> me<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.219> said<00:00:38.420> many<00:00:39.420> people

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I just looked at me and said many people

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.090 
I just looked at me and said many people
said<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.050> rubbish<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.070> for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
said it is rubbish and it's not good for

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
said it is rubbish and it's not good for
all<00:00:41.309> clocking<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.480> using<00:00:42.540> my

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
all clocking so I'm going to be using my

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.810 
all clocking so I'm going to be using my
art<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> cool<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> freezer<00:00:43.829> 7<00:00:44.100> prograf<00:00:44.610> true

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
art it cool in freezer 7 prograf true

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
art it cool in freezer 7 prograf true
but<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.300> current<00:00:45.510> pc<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.140> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
but I'm in my current pc right now but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
but I'm in my current pc right now but
the<00:00:47.670> processor<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.230> find

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the processor is up here but just find

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
the processor is up here but just find
out<00:00:49.559> how<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> open<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:58.460> well<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.670> time

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
out how to open this well this is time

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.950 
out how to open this well this is time
taken<00:01:04.880> just<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.570> will<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> more

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
taken just do this this will be more

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.000 
taken just do this this will be more
simple<00:01:09.770> there<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> here's<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
simple there you go so here's the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.719 
simple there you go so here's the
processor<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> socket<00:01:15.869> 1150<00:01:16.770> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
processor this is socket 1150 it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
processor this is socket 1150 it's
pretty<00:01:18.090> small<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.720> smaller<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.049> my

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
pretty small much smaller than my

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.580 
pretty small much smaller than my
culture<00:01:20.250> quadrille<00:01:20.670> save<00:01:20.850> Hart<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> bit

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
culture quadrille save Hart it is a bit

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
culture quadrille save Hart it is a bit
heavier<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.130> mic<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> ground<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.090> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
heavier my mic or to ground because it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.630 
heavier my mic or to ground because it's
you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:24.990> Hauser<00:01:25.710> architecture<00:01:26.369> has<00:01:26.430> got

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you know Hauser architecture has got

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.100 
you know Hauser architecture has got
more<00:01:26.759> transistors<00:01:27.180> inside<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> like

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
more transistors inside and like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
more transistors inside and like
that<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:29.460> advanced<00:01:29.729> processor<00:01:30.210> it's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that it's a more advanced processor it's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.980 
that it's a more advanced processor it's
a<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:30.540> heavier<00:01:32.420> inside<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> box<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
a bit heavier inside a box here is the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
a bit heavier inside a box here is the
Intel<00:01:36.990> heatsink<00:01:37.530> back<00:01:37.829> comes<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> visitor

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
Intel heatsink back comes with a visitor

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
Intel heatsink back comes with a visitor
sake<00:01:39.060> semi<00:01:39.299> comes<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> processor<00:01:40.520> right

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
sake semi comes with a processor right

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
sake semi comes with a processor right
here<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.829> comes<00:01:44.009> with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
here I'm take it out and it comes with

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
here I'm take it out and it comes with
pre-applied<00:01:44.759> film<00:01:45.240> paste<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
pre-applied film paste but I'm going to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.960 
pre-applied film paste but I'm going to
be<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.310> said<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.729> I've<00:01:47.820> got

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
be using this as I said because I've got

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
be using this as I said because I've got
a<00:01:48.000> better<00:01:48.180> cpu<00:01:48.420> cooler<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.229> no<00:01:49.350> point

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
a better cpu cooler so there's no point

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
a better cpu cooler so there's no point
of<00:01:49.649> me<00:01:49.680> using<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.000> let's<00:01:51.119> move<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.420> over

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of me using this so let's move this over

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
of me using this so let's move this over
to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> side<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.189> post<00:01:53.399> silver<00:01:54.649> don't

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
worry guys I have a grounding myself

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.440 
worry guys I have a grounding myself

you're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> destroy<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.759> CPU<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you're going to destroy the CPU because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.520 
you're going to destroy the CPU because
you<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.600> ground<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.899> yourself<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you don't ground with yourself well I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
you don't ground with yourself well I
have<00:02:04.680> grown<00:02:04.890> myself<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.280> 10<00:02:05.490> times<00:02:05.700> before

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
have grown myself like 10 times before

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.930 
have grown myself like 10 times before
this<00:02:06.060> video<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.509> yeah<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:08.009> anyway<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.789> is
