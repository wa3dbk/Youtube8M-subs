alright<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.010> still<00:00:02.610> considered

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
alright so this is still considered

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.900 
alright so this is still considered
always<00:00:03.360> welcoming<00:00:04.130> pointer<00:00:05.130> sensitivity<00:00:05.790> is

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
always welcoming pointer sensitivity is

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.500 
always welcoming pointer sensitivity is
zero<00:00:06.180> gesture<00:00:06.960> sensitivity<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.710> zero<00:00:08.510> normal

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
zero gesture sensitivity is zero normal

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.290 
zero gesture sensitivity is zero normal
play<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.469> minimum<00:00:11.130> bounding<00:00:11.550> box<00:00:11.790> yeah

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
play is the minimum bounding box yeah

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.870 
play is the minimum bounding box yeah
iron<00:00:12.809> sights<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> maximum<00:00:14.280> bounding<00:00:14.670> box

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
iron sights is the maximum bounding box

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.340 
iron sights is the maximum bounding box
just<00:00:15.599> trying<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:15.929> sure<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.230> the

be<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.599> slow<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:30.929> turning<00:00:31.380> completely

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
be a little slow for turning completely

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
be a little slow for turning completely
around<00:00:32.239> yeah<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.260> well<00:00:34.500> I

around yeah that one like that well I
think<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.950> could<00:00:35.130> show<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.489> still<00:00:35.850> just

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
think you could show you still just

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.580 
think you could show you still just
round<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> options<00:00:38.090> start

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
round going to go to the options start

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.549 
round going to go to the options start
controls<00:00:42.110> trigger<00:00:44.510> play<00:00:45.510> rotation<00:00:46.050> increased

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
controls trigger play rotation increased

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
controls trigger play rotation increased
play<00:00:46.890> rotation<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.640> 70

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.070 

all<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:56.240> now<00:00:57.240> how<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.840> do<00:00:57.960> about

all right now how do you do about

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.360 
all right now how do you do about
turning<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:58.590> us<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:59.330> sitting<00:01:00.330> in<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.690> chair

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
turning around us so sitting in my chair

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.470 
turning around us so sitting in my chair
Avery<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.440> huh<00:01:07.370> does<00:01:08.370> it<00:01:08.520> move<00:01:08.640> move<00:01:09.240> does

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
Avery get up huh does it move move does

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.680 
Avery get up huh does it move move does
he<00:01:09.630> turn<00:01:09.810> around<00:01:09.840> faster<00:01:10.440> now<00:01:11.120> yeah<00:01:12.120> but<00:01:12.540> it's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
he turn around faster now yeah but it's

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.219 
he turn around faster now yeah but it's
still<00:01:13.550> not<00:01:14.550> bad<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.060> moment<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.990> think

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
still not bad for the moment I think

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
still not bad for the moment I think
that<00:01:16.380> turned<00:01:16.620> up<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> nose<00:01:17.190> ever<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that turned up the nose ever you need to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.170 
that turned up the nose ever you need to
move<00:01:18.200> Mississippi<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.770> increase<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:23.180> ya

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
move Mississippi is to increase it to ya

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.749 
move Mississippi is to increase it to ya
okay<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:25.100> do<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.160> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.580> bit

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
which like to get a bit yeah it's not

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.410 
which like to get a bit yeah it's not
fish<00:01:33.660> tuna<00:01:33.869> overall<00:01:34.350> sensitivity<00:01:35.210> where<00:01:36.210> else

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
fish tuna overall sensitivity where else

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
fish tuna overall sensitivity where else
would<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.690> like<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:38.070> kind<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
would you like to go that's kind of a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.230 
would you like to go that's kind of a
redundant<00:01:38.910> option<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.940> what<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
redundant option so what is what you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.070 
redundant option so what is what you
feel<00:01:45.420> comfortable<00:01:45.450> after<00:01:46.170> no<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.680> yet<00:01:51.080> turn

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
feel comfortable after no not yet turn

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.270 
feel comfortable after no not yet turn
that<00:01:52.200> turn<00:01:52.380> around<00:01:52.649> speed<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that turn around speed do you want to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.980 
that turn around speed do you want to
turn<00:01:53.340> around<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.670> quickly<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.030> possible<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
turn around as quickly as possible but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.900 
turn around as quickly as possible but
but<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.770> also<00:01:55.920> affects<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.520> accuracy

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
but it but it also affects your accuracy

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.880 
but it but it also affects your accuracy
it's<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.720> just<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.229> turn<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> around<00:01:58.620> it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it's not just the turn it around it's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's not just the turn it around it's
also<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.370> moving<00:01:59.760> around<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
also just moving around like that you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.640 
also just moving around like that you
need<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.170> movement<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.310> agility

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
need more movement you need more agility

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.899 
need more movement you need more agility
yeah<00:02:04.650> but<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:04.979> you're<00:02:05.130> too<00:02:05.250> twitchy<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.760> will

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
yeah but if you're too twitchy you will

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.180 
yeah but if you're too twitchy you will
never<00:02:06.060> feel<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.330> any<00:02:06.510> money<00:02:06.780> yeah<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.830> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
mean I understand there has to be a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.539 
mean I understand there has to be a
happy<00:02:10.080> medium<00:02:10.320> somewhere<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.160> maybe

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
happy medium somewhere but maybe

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.190 
happy medium somewhere but maybe
increasing<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:14.090> sea<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> mean<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.600> know<00:02:15.690> with

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
increasing the sea I mean you know with

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.240 
increasing the sea I mean you know with
the<00:02:16.230> combination<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> deep<00:02:17.100> end

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the combination of the deep end

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.460 
the combination of the deep end
everything<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.049> won't<00:02:22.320> cut
