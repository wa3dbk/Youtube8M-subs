00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.850
 Here are some influential today following at the start of IBM's TSR 500 second 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.850
 Brown Marcon 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.719
 Meppen 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.749
 No 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.749
 mim 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.239
 with the 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
 in the book 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 in the new one 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.670
 down below 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.020
 mam 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 m 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 Min before parting Fancy more 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.230
 it is enough for me 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.440
 The people of Str 500 Eberle that we probably continue to do until the one 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.630
 Case for fun without reasons you can see that counts the mark but has 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.630
 there the ass is quite smooth because they have no children outside » 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320
 the Shanghai have been several times 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.340
 Tobias they have one built as a Marconi Bari 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 quite clear to see he quadruple screwed the battery compartment for the fourth 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.690
 active electronics where I am then the same with the pickups 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.870
 quite satisfied Bartoli is MK 1 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.590
 two victories Colts be yours 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.350
 Driver the tube there was a little peculiarity and always better 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.290
 would work and thus one regulator has two different ones 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.860
 Who steps of the analysts had to hear on Axen that is if 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.740
 Parents came on foot scuffing was already difficult 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.849
 pr2 Wegscheider could then percent the bass to another 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.890
 with the frequency of course, they bring about unholy at the touch of a button 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.470
 In the front, that means if he has to pass the Boss account 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.380
 To be more dominant without going louder it simply has this wine and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.240
 champagne 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.370
 what's up front 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.940
 then he has Breker here for the plans because he can practically choose which one 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.690
 Packard 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 is used or whether he continues to play 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.159
 in the middle of this Red a bit, then we have just that 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.829
 and Jung, too, now I keep running in parallel 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.829
 and of course a volume control for everything 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:18.610
 Theo continues with the neck this is a neck from Spenge Bobinger 5 3-win 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.279
 you see 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.279
 Schmidt advised the capsule Mischa nod 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.719
 and of course how he rushes some people OK 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.369
 who also has a practical roo 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.169
 very nice fits to the body looks great 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.449
 Lieberknecht has us here in beautiful component still clearly Muscat times 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.829
 that it's practically this little one here 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:38.959
 Shut up here 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.909
 and then we are without him big what screws already have to the Alster 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.370
 Screw that is, if you need to be Steel, you first have to 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.260
 Unscrew the tackle we just make this bell you can 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.349
 just make it a little easier 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.649
 and in a jiffy, the neck is set 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:59.020
 but as an investor you are still worth your while as you see 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.849
 but of course it is questionable it is very important that one 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.099
 the ground mark Schleich also sees a bit here because otherwise the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.489
 Number quickly quite wrong 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.259
 the smoker parried 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.869
 and of course you definitely have 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.179
 better orientation where you play 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.479
 then i start painting 2 by man of what he can do 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.519
 I have s Day Trader League where there are also funds 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.329
 relatively small neutral 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 the full set up both councils also appearances 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.820
 besides I hope it was the biggest drawback the game that one has to say 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.350
 the deputies Dr quite neatly next to the Minden 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 7 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.599
 above 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.639
 while 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.639
 Next 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.009
 mm and the right I take me to 1 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.990
 yes I think they have bomb mines 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.989
 or see in Munich 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.129
 what had happened the position in the market in the consolation itself is good 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:13.949
 Test and order 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.049
 to keep them effective then he has practically more 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.840
 Bach's share of the whole story 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.140
 Of course he has to tick again but alone at us in front of the pier Peder 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:23.830
 Pedersen 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.180
 Lettieri as well with first-time drinking minutes percent 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.860
 Per 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.669
 because now 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.870
 in the dark 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.499
 The End 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:45.020
 Nat was very nice because of the position in front of the defense 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.169
 very nice 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.860
 CBOE discovered by NASA is then outstanding around a little less 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.789
 Brüning 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.809
 hn 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.559
 around Nabucco 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:56.710
 The End 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.979
 around 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.979
 An opposition is now only the neck Beckert alone 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.619
 in Buke Emden below pm 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.650
 we the 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.240
 who of course eat something 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.949
 I like bands that I might be here with just his last trump 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.349
 strong also played a card or change 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.759
 the degree of finally being a bassist sheet 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.240
 small not in the world so to speak 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.310
 and Hey I think I explained everything around 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.260
 In any case, we shot all the fun in case he made the good piece 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.810
 want to try price he stands there therefore ready to go 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.759
 Of course I also had to order online 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.770
