from the recipe and and I just put it to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
from the recipe and and I just put it to
the<00:01:50.579> side<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.340> when<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.460> make<00:01:53.670> ours<00:01:54.200> vanilla

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the side so when we make ours vanilla

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
here so we do okay one thing we do two

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.459 
here so we do okay one thing we do two
things<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:00.899> shot

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
things in one shot

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.830 
things in one shot
so<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.280> melts<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.509> but

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so this melts so this is going to be but

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
so this melts so this is going to be but
this<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> melted<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> within

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
it goes into the microwave so I've

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.170 
it goes into the microwave so I've
stopped<00:02:31.130> trying<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.400> use<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> microwave<00:02:32.000> just

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
stopped trying to use the microwave just

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.780 
stopped trying to use the microwave just
10<00:02:32.600> seconds<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.520> because<00:02:34.520> you're<00:02:34.700> looking

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
10 seconds and because you're looking

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.850 
10 seconds and because you're looking
for<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.300> melt<00:02:35.540> down<00:02:35.690> right<00:02:36.230> won't<00:02:36.500> it'll

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
for it to melt down right won't it'll

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.060 
for it to melt down right won't it'll
just<00:02:37.010> stay<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.250> shape<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.860> that's<00:02:39.860> almost

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
just stay in shape so that's almost

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.470 
just stay in shape so that's almost
ready<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.360> we'll<00:02:42.110> just<00:02:42.230> put<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.860> side

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
ready so we'll just put that to the side

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.150 
ready so we'll just put that to the side
and<00:02:44.480> that's<00:02:45.050> gonna<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.560> base<00:02:45.800> for<00:02:46.130> our

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and that's gonna be the base for our

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.180 
and that's gonna be the base for our
chocolate<00:02:46.730> mousse<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.440> here<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> have<00:02:49.160> some

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
chocolate mousse and here I have some

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.320 
chocolate mousse and here I have some
cream<00:02:49.910> simmering<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.990> have<00:02:51.800> some<00:02:52.010> egg<00:02:52.190> whites

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.240 

or<00:02:59.330> maybe<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.900> early<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.230> me<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.680> think<00:03:00.980> it's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
or maybe it is early for me I think it's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
or maybe it is early for me I think it's
a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:01.430> both<00:03:01.700> probably<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.840> little<00:03:03.110> bit

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
of sugar and I'm just mixing this to its

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.370 
of sugar and I'm just mixing this to its
pale<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.660> gonna<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.870> our<00:03:08.960> vanilla

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
pale and this is gonna be our vanilla

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
if we're doing desserts or something

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.960 
if we're doing desserts or something
because<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.890> flavor<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.310> we're<00:03:37.640> just<00:03:37.670> kind<00:03:37.940> of

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
because of flavor so we're just kind of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.910 
because of flavor so we're just kind of
tempering<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.720> little<00:03:38.870> bit<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.560> added<00:03:39.830> it

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
tempering this a little bit we added it

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.050 
tempering this a little bit we added it
all<00:03:39.980> at<00:03:40.130> once<00:03:40.340> we're<00:03:40.580> probably<00:03:40.730> going<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.000> get

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
all at once we're probably going to get

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.400 
all at once we're probably going to get
scrambled<00:03:41.540> eggs<00:03:43.690> stir<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.170> at<00:03:45.290> all

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
scrambled eggs stir it so that at all

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.080 
scrambled eggs stir it so that at all
then<00:03:45.710> we<00:03:45.800> go<00:03:45.920> right<00:03:45.950> back<00:03:46.250> into<00:03:46.670> here

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
then we go right back into here

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.380 
then we go right back into here
cool<00:03:47.810> off<00:03:48.020> of<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:49.400> now<00:03:49.460> this<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.060> hot<00:03:50.240> and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
cool off of it and now this is hot and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.150 
cool off of it and now this is hot and
we<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:50.660> keeps<00:03:50.840> mixing<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.500> till<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.130> thickens

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
we just keeps mixing it till it thickens

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.340 
we just keeps mixing it till it thickens
up<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.420> once<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.290> thickens<00:03:54.650> up<00:03:55.780> here<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:56.900> add<00:03:57.080> a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
up and once it thickens up here we add a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.230 
up and once it thickens up here we add a
little<00:03:58.100> here<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.550> we<00:03:58.610> have<00:03:58.730> chocolate<00:03:59.090> sauce

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
little here and we have chocolate sauce

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.960 
little here and we have chocolate sauce
now<00:03:59.540> Meister<00:04:00.350> that's<00:04:00.500> right<00:04:00.680> yeah<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.250> we

have vanilla sauce over here
well<00:04:05.350> that<00:04:05.560> should<00:04:05.860> this<00:04:06.040> kind<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.520> change<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
well that should this kind of change the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.260 
well that should this kind of change the
color<00:04:07.180> or<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:07.800> eventually<00:04:08.800> maybe<00:04:09.790> my<00:04:10.030> issue

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
color or is it eventually maybe my issue

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.020 
color or is it eventually maybe my issue
with<00:04:11.430> recipes<00:04:12.430> like<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.450> patience

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
with recipes like this is patience

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.840 
with recipes like this is patience
microwave<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.830> takes<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.160> second<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.700> do

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
microwave this just takes a second to do

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.699 
microwave this just takes a second to do
and<00:04:19.239> again<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:19.900> won<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.290> flavor<00:04:20.500> this

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
and again if we won the flavor this

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.170 
and again if we won the flavor this
vanilla<00:04:21.040> sauce<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.430> we<00:04:21.519> wanted<00:04:21.760> another<00:04:22.000> thing

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
vanilla sauce so we wanted another thing

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.850 
vanilla sauce so we wanted another thing
that<00:04:22.270> goes<00:04:22.390> great<00:04:22.570> with<00:04:22.600> chocolate<00:04:23.080> it's<00:04:23.770> a

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
that goes great with chocolate it's a

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.760 
that goes great with chocolate it's a
little<00:04:24.070> instant<00:04:24.490> coffee<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:26.440> just<00:04:26.470> add<00:04:26.740> a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
little instant coffee you just add a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.230 
little instant coffee you just add a
little<00:04:26.830> hot<00:04:27.100> water<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> jar<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:27.820> instant

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
little hot water to a jar of instant

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.990 
little hot water to a jar of instant
coffee<00:04:28.330> she<00:04:28.660> turns<00:04:29.380> into<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.620> thick<00:04:30.070> syrup<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
coffee she turns into a thick syrup and

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.910 
coffee she turns into a thick syrup and
you<00:04:31.030> could<00:04:31.240> add<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.560> make<00:04:35.650> kind<00:04:35.830> of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
you could add so you can make kind of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.490 
you could add so you can make kind of
several<00:04:36.430> things<00:04:36.990> one<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.200> things<00:04:38.260> that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
several things one of the things that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.080 
several things one of the things that
I've<00:04:38.590> noticed<00:04:38.620> about<00:04:38.950> your<00:04:39.220> recipes<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.880> that

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
I've noticed about your recipes is that

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.330 
I've noticed about your recipes is that
you<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.570> base<00:04:41.200> like<00:04:41.800> I'm<00:04:41.950> gonna<00:04:42.130> call<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
you the base like I'm gonna call it the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.040 
you the base like I'm gonna call it the
foundation<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> foundation<00:04:43.060> remains<00:04:43.660> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
foundation the foundation remains the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.350 
foundation the foundation remains the
same<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.860> you're<00:04:44.980> able<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.460> if<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.880> know<00:04:46.090> how

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
same and you're able to if you know how

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.630 
same and you're able to if you know how
to<00:04:46.420> use<00:04:46.810> all<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.260> ingredients<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.520> know

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
to use all the ingredients and you know

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.370 
to use all the ingredients and you know
a<00:04:48.670> couple<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.060> your<00:04:49.150> techniques<00:04:49.630> you're<00:04:50.080> able

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
a couple of your techniques you're able

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.930 
a couple of your techniques you're able
to<00:04:50.470> really<00:04:50.770> make<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:50.980> lot<00:04:51.160> of<00:04:51.340> different<00:04:51.760> things

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
to really make a lot of different things

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.460 
to really make a lot of different things
absolutely<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.780> think<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.990> lot<00:04:53.170> of<00:04:53.200> people

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
absolutely and I think a lot of people

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.170 
absolutely and I think a lot of people
get<00:04:53.560> confused<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.190> look<00:04:54.340> at<00:04:54.430> each<00:04:54.670> reference

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
get confused so look at each reference

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.330 
get confused so look at each reference
each<00:04:55.870> recipe<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.500> something<00:04:56.800> totally<00:04:57.040> totally

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
each recipe is something totally totally

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.730 
each recipe is something totally totally
separate<00:04:58.000> when<00:04:58.480> really<00:04:58.840> it's<00:04:58.990> just<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.620> can

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
separate when really it's just you can

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.100 
separate when really it's just you can
start<00:05:00.040> up<00:05:00.160> here<00:05:00.370> with<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.420> print<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.960> way

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
start up here with the print the way

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.040 
start up here with the print the way
we're<00:05:02.260> making<00:05:02.560> vanilla<00:05:02.680> sauce<00:05:03.100> here<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:04.330> this

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
we're making vanilla sauce here so this

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.620 
we're making vanilla sauce here so this
could<00:05:05.230> be<00:05:05.260> flan<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.370> could<00:05:06.550> be<00:05:06.670> crumbly<00:05:07.240> this

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
could be flan this could be crumbly this

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.740 
could be flan this could be crumbly this
could<00:05:07.840> be<00:05:07.990> ice<00:05:08.680> cream<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.419> there's<00:05:10.630> so

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
could be ice cream and so there's so

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.970 
could be ice cream and so there's so
many<00:05:10.810> different<00:05:11.140> things<00:05:11.200> we<00:05:11.440> could<00:05:11.560> make<00:05:11.740> from

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
many different things we could make from

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.450 
many different things we could make from
this<00:05:12.300> ice<00:05:13.300> cream<00:05:13.600> huh<00:05:13.810> so<00:05:14.530> just<00:05:15.340> by<00:05:15.430> changing

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
this ice cream huh so just by changing

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.920 
this ice cream huh so just by changing
one<00:05:16.360> or<00:05:16.390> two<00:05:16.660> less<00:05:17.260> yolks<00:05:17.590> or<00:05:18.510> cream<00:05:19.510> instead

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
one or two less yolks or cream instead

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.250 
one or two less yolks or cream instead
of<00:05:21.810> milk<00:05:22.810> or<00:05:23.140> whatever<00:05:24.150> all<00:05:25.150> right<00:05:25.330> very<00:05:25.960> good

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
of milk or whatever all right very good

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.040 
of milk or whatever all right very good
that<00:05:26.890> will<00:05:27.010> dissolve<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.580> minute<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:28.360> was

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
that will dissolve in a minute I was

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.620
