00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
because that makes it the easiest to cut

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
because that makes it the easiest to cut
the<00:01:26.790> peels<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.770> bit

the peels off if you have a little bit

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
the peels off if you have a little bit
of<00:01:28.920> peel<00:01:29.220> left<00:01:29.430> over<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.909> totally<00:01:30.420> okay

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
of peel left over that's totally okay

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
gets nice and thick I would say probably

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.990 
gets nice and thick I would say probably
three<00:02:45.470> or<00:02:45.560> four<00:02:45.709> minutes<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:46.910> of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
three or four minutes of this kind of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.479 
three or four minutes of this kind of
rolling<00:02:47.450> boil<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.440> then<00:02:48.920> when<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.340> done

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
rolling boil and then when that is done

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.250 
rolling boil and then when that is done
just<00:02:49.700> turn<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> heat<00:02:50.270> off<00:02:50.330> take<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.810> off<00:02:51.020> of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
just turn the heat off take it off of

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.790 
just turn the heat off take it off of
the<00:02:51.350> heat<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.830> then<00:02:52.400> you're<00:02:52.520> going<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.940> melt<00:02:53.209> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
the heat and then you're going to melt a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.590 
the heat and then you're going to melt a
quarter<00:02:54.800> cup<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.040> brown<00:02:55.730> sugar<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.330> quarter

cup of butter until it starts to kind of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.190 
cup of butter until it starts to kind of
sizzle<00:02:58.790> then<00:02:59.330> you're<00:02:59.450> gonna<00:02:59.570> pour<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.050> those

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
sizzle then you're gonna pour in those

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.660 
sizzle then you're gonna pour in those

once all the bread cubes are laid in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.199 
once all the bread cubes are laid in
there<00:04:03.290> then<00:04:03.950> you're<00:04:04.190> gonna<00:04:04.280> take<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.610> rest<00:04:04.970> of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.960 
once it is all poured you want to take a
fork<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.470> just<00:04:39.530> kind<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.130> smash<00:04:40.490> those<00:04:40.730> bread

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
fork and just kind of smash those bread

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.970 
fork and just kind of smash those bread
cubes<00:04:41.210> down<00:04:41.570> into<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.110> egg<00:04:42.260> mixture<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.740> make

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
cubes down into the egg mixture and make

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.650 
cubes down into the egg mixture and make
sure<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.310> they<00:04:43.430> are<00:04:43.550> all<00:04:43.820> coated<00:04:44.360> because

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
sure that they are all coated because

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.660 
sure that they are all coated because
otherwise<00:04:44.930> you're<00:04:45.140> gonna<00:04:45.200> get<00:04:45.470> hard<00:04:46.250> bread

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
otherwise you're gonna get hard bread

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.020 
otherwise you're gonna get hard bread
cubes<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.360> then<00:04:47.900> let<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.290> sit<00:04:48.860> for<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.850> don't

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
cubes and then let that sit for I don't

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.540 
cubes and then let that sit for I don't
know<00:04:50.210> as<00:04:50.390> long<00:04:50.570> as<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.780> takes<00:04:50.930> for<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.710> mixture

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
know as long as it takes for the mixture

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.030 
know as long as it takes for the mixture
to<00:04:52.700> be<00:04:52.730> absorb<00:04:53.090> probably<00:04:53.450> like<00:04:53.600> five<00:04:53.900> minutes

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
to be absorb probably like five minutes

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.350 
to be absorb probably like five minutes
then<00:04:55.040> you're<00:04:55.310> gonna<00:04:55.430> take<00:04:55.670> your<00:04:55.730> salted
