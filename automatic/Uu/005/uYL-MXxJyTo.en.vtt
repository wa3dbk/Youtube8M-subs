00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello and welcome to the vineyard of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.220
 roasted rib we are in a vineyard 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 historical and prestigious since the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.420
 vineyard of two roasted ribs does not count 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 no less than twenty-four centuries 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 of history in one of the places well 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 obviously the most difficult to 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 work in France while defeating 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 that early it is a vineyard that on time 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.920
 current covers a surface in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.149
 production of about 265 hectares 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 so it's both important for a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.030
 quality vineyard still well 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.500
 modest compared to all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 vineyards in their entirety 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.340
 we produce obviously 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 only great red wines with 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.469
 the syrah grape 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 here it is often said that roast rib is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 the cradle of syrah is with our 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.920
 neighbors of the hermitage the area of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.780
 production 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 sir has always been queen at the day 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.740
 today the vineyard is spread 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.659
 on a number of producers he 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 there are about forty 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.170
 of bottlers in the vineyard who and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 then some big units of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 production we have obviously 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 vinification for wines for aging 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.829
 longevity therefore quite macerations 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.420
 long of the order fifteen days three 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 weeks or even a month think some 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 cuvÃ©es there is a peculiarity in the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.899
 vineyard that everyone is talking about 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 Frequently it is the coast and the coast 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.110
 blonde is here you have to know that the coast 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.360
 brunet the coast blood are two 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.460
 Well- defined localities inside 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.880
 roasted coast vineyard 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.280
 this goes back to the legend that 1 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.079
 seniors in then had two 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.329
 beautiful girls obviously a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.770
 brunette and a blonde and he gave one of 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.750
 his best that early to the brunette and a 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 of her best than you blonde and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.489
 since we have the coast 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.600
 brunet the blond coast so outside of 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.070
 this legend 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.550
 there are some realities 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.120
 at the floor level of the exhibitions then 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 on the brown coast it's the part of the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 vineyard which is the southernmost is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.710
 who and with at the soil level to 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780
 mika schist dominance with rates 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.610
 doxic of doing a little bit more 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.520
 important which always gives a little 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 more strength and power to wines 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.030
 of these from this sector there on the coast 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.560
 blonde hair 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 geologists tell us that we 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 are on Geneva where we have a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.970
 little less than oxidized iron and which by 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.750
 against gives more generous wines to 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.100
 aromatic level with more 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.960
 of perhaps perfume expressions in 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.000
