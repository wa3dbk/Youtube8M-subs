we are not designed to eat meat because

we are not designed to eat meat because
we<00:00:07.080> don't<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.980> teeth<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.269> rip<00:00:09.599> our<00:00:09.870> flesh

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
we don't have the teeth to rip our flesh

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.539 
we don't have the teeth to rip our flesh
from<00:00:10.590> an<00:00:10.710> animal<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.780> you<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:13.320> died<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:14.340> you

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
from an animal that you just died if you

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.849 
from an animal that you just died if you
were<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> cat<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.109> rip<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.650> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
were a cat you can rip it and you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
were a cat you can rip it and you
swallow<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:17.490> away<00:00:17.640> our<00:00:18.270> teeth<00:00:18.630> don't

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
swallow it right away our teeth don't

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
swallow it right away our teeth don't
have<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.380> design<00:00:19.770> they<00:00:20.010> would<00:00:20.189> fall<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.670> if

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
have that design they would fall out if

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.330 
have that design they would fall out if
you<00:00:21.119> did<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> try<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you did that try to do that it's so

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.689 
you did that try to do that it's so
tight<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.180> flesh<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.830> tied<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
tight the flesh is so you're tied it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.689 
tight the flesh is so you're tied it
becomes<00:00:27.029> you're<00:00:27.480> more<00:00:27.750> easily<00:00:28.429> durable<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
becomes you're more easily durable and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.030 
becomes you're more easily durable and
you<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:30.359> cooking<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> break<00:00:31.859> down

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you are cooking it when you break down

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430 
you are cooking it when you break down
the<00:00:32.369> protein<00:00:32.790> structures<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> enjoy

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the protein structures which is enjoy

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
the protein structures which is enjoy
them<00:00:34.710> which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> destroying<00:00:35.700> them<00:00:36.000> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
them which is destroying them you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.850 
them which is destroying them you're
cooking<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.260> chew<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
cooking it so you can chew it you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
cooking it so you can chew it you
destroy<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> protein<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.450> can

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
destroy the protein and then you can

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.490 
destroy the protein and then you can
chew<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.980> okay<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> becomes<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.910> bread<00:00:42.500> in

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
chew it okay so it becomes like bread in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.670 
chew it okay so it becomes like bread in
a<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.789> whereas<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> form<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.500> body

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
a way whereas in that form your body

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.279 
a way whereas in that form your body
doesn't<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.640> ability<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> plus

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
doesn't have the ability to do that plus

why did Nature not put protein in breast

percent<00:02:33.340> protein<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.510> why<00:02:34.689> would<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.170> be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200

even<00:02:35.709> less<00:02:35.920> protein<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.579> older<00:02:36.879> you<00:02:37.000> grow

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
even less protein the older you grow

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.409 
even less protein the older you grow
because<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:39.010> don't<00:02:39.219> need<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.549> eat<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.909> we're

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
because we don't need to eat it we're

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919

because<00:02:47.919> it<00:02:48.519> will<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.909> much<00:02:49.299> harder<00:02:49.569> on<00:02:49.900> the

because it will be much harder on the

side effects are much harder that's why

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.289
