 That's right, it wasn't a guard inspection . 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.260
 I think it's more interesting than people to some extent 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.130
 Some people say that all Kansains should not think interesting but to some extent 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.509
 I can play a role 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.509

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.720
 Tension is felt kneaded say when and whether if low 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.860

 Not even been told Lotte only raised by N Pepper when the play-by-play and low basic tension 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.229
 difficult 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 Even if you're just looking at something you ca n't wear a language If you do n't know the language you can see until the end 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.580
 Not a level I I I I I might be as much as you like 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.840

 Well it's really boring 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.850
 I actually have something to do with just playing 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.610
 I would like to strengthen my talk in a serious way, but it is interesting to see the river too 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.580
 Something seriously in play fucking feces 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.080
 It laughs of the river would come down was seriously 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.920
 Isn't it going out to nature naturally ? It feels like a river rock life like an ic coffin 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.110

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.840
 I really moved 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 Is it really heavy 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.260
 Maybe you're going to smile all over the world if you draw a line drawing 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.260
 That level 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.359
 I am 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.600
 Naa Omon'nai Seriously is not talking now No Maji 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.110
 Let's fix a little more to the mountain 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.390
 When the tension is high, see the comments of Toru ネ 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.410
 Today 's Mr. Hanahana tension is high, so it will be an interesting residence 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 There is a time to break up 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.920
 There are times when layer does not have agreement clearly 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.159
 Yappa to different in the number of life, even if such I think you out to comment 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.700
 I'm more of a comment is different 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:55.020
 Well, the game that worked well meme me So the game will grow 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.430
 It's a really subtle game but it wo n't grow 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.430
 I think a little after that whether it will spread by word of mouth 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.420
 The viewer through today's bar to see the in feeling like the form of real chai 3 Tabine 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.440
 Pinko remember 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.110

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.690
 Rice is nice 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.710
 It 's a straight line to say that it's on Reuters 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.500
 dangerous 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.729

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:50.920
 This is always a shovel very heavy mischief 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:54.460
 I woman star yet at a level that mistake a two-Based Asian woman to imitate the face of the woman voice 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.650
 Ekko's voice Who seems to be talking 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.100
 It's like a voice changer 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.760
 Is it really serious? 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.760
