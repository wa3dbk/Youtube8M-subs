00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.860
 gameplay congratulations to you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.759
 xcom enemy a noun on android given 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.500
 The strategy came out in 2012 on pc and 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:24.000
 it was a continuation of the legendary 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.740
 tactical strategy x-com 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 and let's see how u 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 developers managed to transfer this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.900
 version on touch screens and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 adapt to touch control 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.180
 I will immediately say that mobile graphics 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.220
 versions are a bit stripped down but it's in 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.650
 principle is understandable because mobile 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 graphics processor not yet capable 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.769
 Paul we have to play graphics 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.540
 which produces reproduces 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.989
 normal computer so to speak 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.420
 video cards and so management in principle 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.339
 intuitively and in addition to indicate 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.449
 points of movement perform various 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.979
 commands and also for example 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 confirm command execution 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170
 it is necessary to press for example the mov button 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.229
 to run across so the following 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.619
 we need to take it now 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.079
 position on the roof and let's try it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.350
 do what for this we need to do 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.479
 we need to take this one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.710
 I know what it is called there is no sticker 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.429
 marker and drag it over to this point 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 click give and go to 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.710
 We selected a fighting stance but 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.140
 actually alien I do not remember said 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.960
 I like you and the story of reneet seems not so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.649
 aliens have captured our land very much 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.380
 not captured but trying to do it 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.409
 our goal is to confront them and destroy 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.170
 we work them in some kind of 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.030
 a special company like this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.859
 engaged in protecting the earth 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.380
 she is international therefore there 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.639
 be present all nations there also have 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.229
 and representative 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:08.600
 so say our mother Russia and so 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.970
 after you for example 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.240
 complete all their moves movement 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 the opponentâ€™s move will start because 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.630
 turn-based strategy and so what will they do 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.250
 these horrible monkeys with acid screws 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.830
 cannon so in general everything is clear what else 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.200
 you can do you can shoot you 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.390
 you can throw a grenade you can follow 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.160
 but now we need to shoot because 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.210
 this is another tea mission here 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.880
 there are small ones like this 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.850
 say learning moments and let's 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 try to get in right now by 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.990
 stranger but in this stranger 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.300
 it's probably not very good to get here 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.420
 it will turn out because it is not under 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.790
 quite convenient angle of fire but 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.340
 I think of this stranger we will shoot 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.310
 easy yes we did it and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.950
 the continuation of our move begins we 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.700
 give orders to other members of ours 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 teams 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.730
 let's send it here and after 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.190
 let him run this way here 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.690
 what else can you do here with 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.330
 With the help of such movements you can 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.790
 change the camera angle but if 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.550
 for example, you are not so comfortable to do change 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.160
 camera angle can be and here 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.800
 there are such buttons here 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.200
 they can also be present easily 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330
 free 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.380
 respectively, to give the order to disclose 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.660
 let's not move here 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.000
 run over here you can also 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.150
 skip the move if you do not want to change 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.980
 position of their warriors and wait what 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.180
 will take the strength of an opponent he runs away with 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.640
 there but let's try to catch him 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.850
 Siri maybe we succeed him 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.490
 somehow still destroy to me 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.280
 of course I really wanted a toy 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.560
 has quite good effects 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.739
 game is done 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 guts anrial that of course pleases too 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.070
 so my next move game is think 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.180
 will tighten you for a long time the plot is here too 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.669
 long enough and in the end you 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.570
 will be able to free the land from alien 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.389
 invaders 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.560
 the toy is definitely worth familiarization with 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:38.080
 but I want to immediately note that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.720
 prevent you from doing it firstly price 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.660
 games 355 rubles 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.120
 quite expensive, and a lot, and the second 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.340
 toy takes about three 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.540
 half a gigabyte on your device 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.880
 that is, if you have no places or it is small 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.729
 then it will be very sad because 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.580
 you will not be able to play this game and 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.710
 if you count the approximate weight of the game and 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.430
 the cost of the game then goes about 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.800
 somewhere a ruble for 10 megabytes like this 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.770
 here but in principle it is not so expensive 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.820
 I think that fans of turn-based strategies 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.610
 fans of the xcom series are simply obliged 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.490
 download I get acquainted also with 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.010
 mobile version of who passed it will be able to 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.990
 pereproti it that way here besides 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.229
 thats all you still have 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.380
 special headquarters there you can hire 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.060
 warriors who will participate in 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.919
 companies you can choose countries 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.729
 who you want to protect first 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.970
 turn 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.270
 and for example from your choice of that side 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.419
 which ones you choose will depend 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.210
 other countries future strategy to me 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.780
 liked very cool cool and 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.530
 it can even be said is one of 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.530
 legendary
