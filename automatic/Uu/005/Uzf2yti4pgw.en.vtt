section and right back into the groove

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.500 
section and right back into the groove
so<00:00:26.660> really<00:00:26.870> just<00:00:26.900> two<00:00:27.170> sections<00:00:27.620> to<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:27.920> um

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
so really just two sections to it um

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.510 
so really just two sections to it um
pretty<00:00:29.510> straightforward<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.619> piano<00:00:30.920> parts<00:00:31.280> a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
pretty straightforward the piano parts a

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.939 
pretty straightforward the piano parts a
little<00:00:31.880> not<00:00:32.509> really<00:00:32.750> too<00:00:33.050> complicated<00:00:33.500> just

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
little not really too complicated just

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.150 
little not really too complicated just
kind<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.219> getting<00:00:34.399> used<00:00:34.699> to<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.060> um<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:36.160> guess

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
kind of getting used to it um I guess

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.130 
kind of getting used to it um I guess
questions<00:00:37.790> anything<00:00:38.150> like<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:38.360> let<00:00:38.840> me<00:00:38.870> know

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
questions anything like that let me know

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.950 
questions anything like that let me know
and<00:00:39.410> I'll<00:00:40.250> see<00:00:40.310> what<00:00:40.579> I<00:00:40.610> can<00:00:40.760> do<00:00:40.910> I'm<00:00:41.840> gonna

and I'll see what I can do I'm gonna

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.350 
and I'll see what I can do I'm gonna
play<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.380> at<00:00:42.560> speed<00:00:42.829> for<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:43.280> on<00:00:43.460> how<00:00:43.700> then

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
play this at speed for you on how then

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.880 
play this at speed for you on how then
I'll<00:00:44.480> slow<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.840> down<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.260> kind<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.800> know

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890

then also play with a metronome for you

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.819 
then also play with a metronome for you
it's<00:00:52.340> at<00:00:52.489> 100<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.079> if<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.230> want<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.469> practice

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
100 so always good to practice with the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.950 
100 so always good to practice with the
metronome<00:00:58.700> for<00:00:58.850> stuff<00:00:59.180> that's<00:00:59.360> kind<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.780> you

so<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.989> full<00:02:13.260> form<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
so really that's the full form of the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.520 
so really that's the full form of the
song<00:02:14.120> it's<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> groove<00:02:15.629> pattern<00:02:15.930> throughout

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
song it's the groove pattern throughout

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.750 
song it's the groove pattern throughout
most<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> course<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.180> word<00:02:19.760> changes

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
most and the course is that word changes

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.309 
most and the course is that word changes
to<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.920> pattern<00:02:23.310> here<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:25.080> left

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
to that so this pattern here the left

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:35.870 
to that so this pattern here the left
hand<00:02:25.590> is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.030 

it's<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.020> little<00:02:37.230> push<00:02:37.440> turn<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.770> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it's like a little push turn in a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's like a little push turn in a
flattened

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240

many<00:03:39.950> great<00:03:40.130> ways<00:03:40.420> practices<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
many great ways practices like that and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.890 
many great ways practices like that and
you<00:03:42.590> can<00:03:42.680> get<00:03:42.770> a<00:03:42.800> metronome<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.730> that's<00:03:44.720> like

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you can get a metronome and that's like

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750 
you can get a metronome and that's like
this<00:03:44.990> is<00:03:45.110> at<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.710> album<00:03:46.100> speed<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.730> can

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
this is at that album speed and you can

00:03:46.760 --> 00:04:02.360 
this is at that album speed and you can
practice

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.650 

I'm<00:04:03.370> really<00:04:03.760> mad<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.000> know<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.300> know<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.390> just

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
I'm really mad you know you know I just

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.470 
I'm really mad you know you know I just
started<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.200> can<00:04:05.440> start

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:29.409 

you

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.389 

and<00:04:30.419> work<00:04:30.779> your<00:04:30.929> way<00:04:31.050> up<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.469> speed<00:04:32.099> or<00:04:32.129> what

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:32.399 
and work your way up to speed or what

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:35.329 
and work your way up to speed or what
not<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:32.639> you<00:04:33.379> know<00:04:34.379> hopefully<00:04:34.649> you<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.069> see

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:35.339 
not so you know hopefully you can see

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:39.109 
not so you know hopefully you can see
enough<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.969> it<00:04:36.779> would<00:04:36.959> not<00:04:37.580> make<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.639> just<00:04:38.939> a

00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:39.119 
enough of it it would not make it just a

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.540 
enough of it it would not make it just a
repetition<00:04:39.330> stay<00:04:39.929> on<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.739> chorus<00:04:41.159> sounds

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
repetition stay on the chorus sounds

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:53.050 
repetition stay on the chorus sounds
like<00:04:41.699> this

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.320 

poor<00:04:53.810> ray
