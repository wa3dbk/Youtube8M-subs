00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
had to use a pneumatic air driven tool

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
had to use a pneumatic air driven tool
well<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.540> cool<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.259> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
rusted metal effect and I think we

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.809 
rusted metal effect and I think we
pulled<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.170> off<00:02:10.289> pretty<00:02:10.619> pretty<00:02:11.220> nice<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.640> used

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
pulled it off pretty pretty nice we used

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.210 
pulled it off pretty pretty nice we used
a<00:02:11.910> combination<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.720> both

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
a combination of both

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.340 
a combination of both
acid<00:02:13.490> stains<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.090> decorative<00:02:14.930> concrete<00:02:15.080> in

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
acid stains and decorative concrete in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.340 
acid stains and decorative concrete in
Sioux<00:02:15.560> dies<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.180> rivet<00:02:17.510> sections<00:02:18.110> like

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
Sioux dies on the rivet sections like

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.690 
Sioux dies on the rivet sections like
right<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.980> made<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> look<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.520> it's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
right there we made it look like it's

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790 
right there we made it look like it's
rusting<00:02:20.240> even<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> license<00:02:21.230> plate<00:02:21.440> frames

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.740 
rusting even on the license plate frames
it<00:02:22.040> looks<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.520> rusting<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.480> did<00:02:23.630> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
it looks like it's rusting we did that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.280 
it looks like it's rusting we did that
with<00:02:23.870> an<00:02:23.960> airbrush<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.310> dyes<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.960> got<00:02:27.110> some

really cool effects and as you can see
on<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> rivets<00:02:30.070> we<00:02:31.070> gave<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.490> illusion<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:32.090> a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
on the rivets we gave the illusion of a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.270 
on the rivets we gave the illusion of a
shadow<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.960> light<00:02:33.560> where<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.860> looks<00:02:34.190> like

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
shadow and a light where it looks like

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.330 
shadow and a light where it looks like
the<00:02:34.640> rivets<00:02:35.150> are<00:02:35.530> actually<00:02:36.530> recessed<00:02:37.070> into

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the rivets are actually recessed into

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250 
the rivets are actually recessed into
the<00:02:37.610> concrete<00:02:37.880> countertop<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.600> then<00:02:38.720> reality

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
the concrete countertop and then reality

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.170 
the concrete countertop and then reality
they're<00:02:39.410> flat<00:02:39.680> that's<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.220> with<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.640> using

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
they're flat that's just with the using

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.540 
they're flat that's just with the using
shadow<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.870> light<00:02:42.050> did<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> logo<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.250> our

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
shadow and light did a logo for our

really neat detail this is where two
countertops<00:02:55.310> meet<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.330> recess<00:02:56.990> this<00:02:57.230> area

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
countertops meet we recess this area

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.910 
countertops meet we recess this area
down<00:02:57.830> where<00:02:58.310> we've<00:02:58.640> cut<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.680> motorcycle<00:03:00.680> chain

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
down where we've cut a motorcycle chain

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.340 
down where we've cut a motorcycle chain
apart<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.700> what<00:03:01.850> we're<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.240> do<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.870> take

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
apart and what we're going to do is take

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.470 
apart and what we're going to do is take
this<00:03:03.590> gear<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.250> epoxy<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.060> where<00:03:05.330> it's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
this gear in epoxy it where it's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260 
this gear in epoxy it where it's
actually<00:03:05.930> higher<00:03:06.320> or<00:03:06.740> raised<00:03:07.220> up<00:03:07.580> above<00:03:07.820> the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
actually higher or raised up above the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.660 
actually higher or raised up above the
countertop<00:03:08.810> which<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.709> just<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> neat<00:03:10.190> element

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
countertop which is just a neat element

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.590 
countertop which is just a neat element
so<00:03:10.790> we've<00:03:10.940> got<00:03:11.090> some<00:03:11.270> three-dimensional

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
so we've got some three-dimensional

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.790 
so we've got some three-dimensional
action<00:03:12.380> going<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:12.800> as<00:03:12.980> well<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.270> on<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.380> this

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
action going on as well so on all this

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.710 
action going on as well so on all this
was<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> fun<00:03:16.280> project<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.940> lot<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.450> hard<00:03:17.630> work
