despite how difficult it is to get
anything<00:02:16.220> done<00:02:16.609> in<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> city<00:02:17.450> somehow<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
anything done in the city somehow the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.069 
anything done in the city somehow the
miracle<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.760> always<00:02:19.970> gets<00:02:20.420> done<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
miracle is that it always gets done and

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.549 
miracle is that it always gets done and
I<00:02:21.170> think<00:02:21.350> that's<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> most<00:02:21.799> beautiful<00:02:22.340> thing
