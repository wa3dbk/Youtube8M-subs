00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
only thing that I could even possibly

think of that would cause that is the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.849 
think of that would cause that is the
piston<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:44.180> let<00:02:44.569> me<00:02:44.690> know<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.870> guys<00:02:45.109> cuz<00:02:45.739> I

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
that connecting rod keeps clanking

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.259 
that connecting rod keeps clanking
that's<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.200> only<00:03:06.500> noise<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.030> before<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.120> had

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
that's the only noise and before it had
