00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
I like to use it I like to get it on a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.600 
I like to use it I like to get it on a
bench<00:00:22.640> where<00:00:22.880> I've<00:00:23.000> got<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> nice<00:00:23.590> stable

rifle<00:00:27.530> is<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.830> 308<00:00:28.370> and<00:00:29.150> like<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.660> said<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.080> got

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
rifle is a 308 and like I said it's got

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.260 
rifle is a 308 and like I said it's got
a<00:00:30.260> thermal<00:00:30.800> unit<00:00:31.220> on<00:00:31.370> it<00:00:31.610> this<00:00:31.760> is<00:00:31.940> made<00:00:32.119> by

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
a thermal unit on it this is made by

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.009 
a thermal unit on it this is made by
armasight<00:00:32.899> what<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:33.800> like<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.249> do<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:35.019> you'll

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
armasight what I like to do is you'll

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.470 
armasight what I like to do is you'll
notice<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> target<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.160> have<00:00:37.429> a<00:00:37.480> small

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
notice on the target I have a small

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.290 
notice on the target I have a small
piece<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.989> tinfoil<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.399> reason<00:00:40.789> for<00:00:41.030> that

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
piece of tinfoil and the reason for that

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.020 
piece of tinfoil and the reason for that
is<00:00:41.600> because<00:00:41.749> this<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.829> a<00:00:42.859> thermal<00:00:43.399> unit<00:00:43.850> it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
is because this is a thermal unit it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.720 
is because this is a thermal unit it
will<00:00:44.449> not<00:00:44.659> show<00:00:44.989> detail<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.609> the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
will not show detail of just the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.910 
will not show detail of just the
cardboard<00:00:47.300> backstop<00:00:47.870> I've<00:00:48.170> got<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.589> have<00:00:48.739> that

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
cardboard backstop I've got to have that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520 
cardboard backstop I've got to have that
piece<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.370> tin<00:00:50.120> foil<00:00:50.359> on<00:00:50.480> there<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.260> can

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
piece of tin foil on there so I can

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.579 
piece of tin foil on there so I can
actually<00:00:51.739> see<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:53.269> crosshairs<00:00:53.839> on<00:00:54.019> the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
actually see the crosshairs on the

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.709 
actually see the crosshairs on the
target<00:00:54.979> now<00:00:55.460> I've<00:00:55.609> got<00:00:55.819> the<00:00:55.969> thermal<00:00:56.359> setup

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
target now I've got the thermal setup

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.129 
target now I've got the thermal setup
where<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:57.199> on<00:00:57.339> white-hot<00:00:58.339> and<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.809> can<00:00:59.960> see

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
where it is on white-hot and you can see

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.079 
where it is on white-hot and you can see
that<00:01:00.289> piece<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.679> tin<00:01:00.859> foil<00:01:01.069> very<00:01:01.460> easily<00:01:01.729> you

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
that piece of tin foil very easily you

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.520 
that piece of tin foil very easily you
can<00:01:02.210> see<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.479> crosshairs<00:01:02.960> through<00:01:03.170> there<00:01:03.319> but

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
can see the crosshairs through there but

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.869 
can see the crosshairs through there but
this<00:01:03.739> works<00:01:03.949> like<00:01:04.190> I<00:01:04.280> said<00:01:04.430> whether<00:01:04.640> you're

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
this works like I said whether you're

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.959 
this works like I said whether you're
using<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.860> thermal<00:01:06.860> vision<00:01:07.040> scope<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.729> this

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
using a thermal vision scope like this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.120 
using a thermal vision scope like this
or<00:01:08.270> whether<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.110> use<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.740> standard

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
or whether you use in just a standard

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.800 
or whether you use in just a standard
rifle<00:01:10.579> scope<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.210> what<00:01:11.420> we're<00:01:11.540> going<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.689> do

that way I need to be able to watch and
see<00:01:28.969> where<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.210> hit<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:30.170> real<00:01:30.560> important<00:01:31.159> to

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189

this is real important at this point
we're<00:01:45.649> going<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.829> go<00:01:45.950> down<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.310> we're<00:01:46.429> going

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
we're going to go down and we're going

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.330 
we're going to go down and we're going
to<00:01:46.579> mark<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:48.380> bullet<00:01:48.740> hole<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> piece<00:01:49.310> of

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
to mark that bullet hole with a piece of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.830 
to mark that bullet hole with a piece of
tinfoil

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.910 

all<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.200> wouldn't<00:01:54.350> have<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.619> do<00:01:54.740> this

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
all right you wouldn't have to do this
if<00:01:55.159> you're<00:01:55.280> using<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.909> standard<00:01:55.969> rifle<00:01:56.630> scope

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
if you're using a standard rifle scope

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.289 
if you're using a standard rifle scope
but<00:01:57.200> using<00:01:57.710> thermal<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.759> necessary

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
but using thermal this is necessary

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.620 
but using thermal this is necessary
because<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.630> cannot<00:02:00.109> see<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> bullet<00:02:00.859> hole

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
because you cannot see the bullet hole

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.539 
because you cannot see the bullet hole
without<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.289> what<00:02:03.469> we're<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.950> is

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
without it so what we're going to do is

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
without it so what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:05.509> going<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.780> staple

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
we're going to staple

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.800 
we're going to staple
a<00:02:08.319> piece<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.250> tinfoil<00:02:09.729> right<00:02:10.000> over<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> bullet

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
a piece of tinfoil right over the bullet

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.009 
a piece of tinfoil right over the bullet
hole<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.849> here's<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.150> tricky<00:02:13.450> part<00:02:13.480> coming

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
hole and here's the tricky part coming

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.839 
hole and here's the tricky part coming
up<00:02:16.110> okay<00:02:17.110> here<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> tricky<00:02:17.950> part<00:02:17.980> pay

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
up okay here is a tricky part pay

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.520
