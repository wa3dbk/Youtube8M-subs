you might think the entire bar lit up
probably<00:01:38.910> runs<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.240> 12<00:01:39.600> amps<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
probably runs about 12 amps it's a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.620 
probably runs about 12 amps it's a
little<00:01:41.550> higher<00:01:41.700> than<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> Liberty

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
on there we're talking 50 or 60 plus
emails<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.590> power<00:01:52.800> difference<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
emails for it so the power difference is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.780 
emails for it so the power difference is
pretty<00:01:53.520> substantial<00:01:55.009> but<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.100> does<00:01:56.340> give<00:01:56.640> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
companies use them so let's take this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:22.330 
companies use them so let's take this
light<00:03:04.049> bar<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.260> power<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> up
