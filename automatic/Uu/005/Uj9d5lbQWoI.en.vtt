00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.450
 this is the point selector that serves 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 to select the basic points or 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 utilities the flexible points or 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 decoration 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.350
 note that the points are drawn in 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 paris in the selector the drawings in red 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 are the flexible points and the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 gray on decorative spots and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.489
 basic or utilities 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 when you take the point selector 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.230
 to select a point that is possible 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690
 that you want to use it as well. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.629
 selector of the point until the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.809
 red point to activate from the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.120
 Once you turn red, you can rotate the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.140
 selector lever a little to the left or to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.440
 on the right 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 depending on how you want the point 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.000
 to select the gray dots you want 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 use the dot length selector 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 again but this time it should be 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.049
 between 0 and 5 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.309
 depending on the outcome you are going 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.309
 want to get from the point 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.190
 the basic sewing points are 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.340
 also called utility points 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.580
 among them are the points straight zigue 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 Invisible hem sheath and a lot of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 guiza 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.210
 most of your seams will be made 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 with the straight stitching on the needle plate 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 you will find lines that serve as 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 guides to help you guide the fabric in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.850
 right direction 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.640
 depending on how much you want to stop 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 edge in the seam the most 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 used are one centimeter and one 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.470
 centimeter and a half that are here for 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.539
 start sewing place the fabric under 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.800
 this sharing and below the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.110
 Ecuador 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.860
 I did it on the dildo pedal and make some 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
 points 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 press the rewind lever to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 down and make some points back 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 the points were stuck and not 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.619
 says sewed release Alagoas setback 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.979
 and sewing machine for front of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.979
 new 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.709
 do the same to finish 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:27.260
 stitch to remove the seam from the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.030
 turn the steering wheel toward you. 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.269
 until the needle is in the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.959
 high and continues to spin until the needle 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.450
 start going down again 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.090
 raise your shoe and remove your 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.660
 machine to cut lines 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 pulls down from the shoe 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.970
 to the left side of the back of the machine 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.400
 and pass the cut wire to use the room 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.680
 this way the lines stayed with the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.870
 ideal length and did not leave the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.630
 position to start a new 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.519
 zig zag stitching is also used 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.310
 to make the point to be signed in 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.410
 machine applications 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.570
 the width of the zigzag tale should be 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 regulated in accordance with the appearance 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.200
 do you want to give to the project? 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.390
 the performance of the contract should be 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.700
 as possible so that you do not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 you can see the fabric between the dots 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.010
 the multipurpose point and design 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.340
 is generally used to serve and to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.860
 make patches to serve put a 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.530
 fabric as reinforcement on reverse side 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.620
 to stabilize work 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.380
 stitch over the center of the tear now 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.540
 stitch again on each side of the tear 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.790
 to ensure it will not unconfigure 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.040
 to make a patch 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.110
 place a flap over the hole of the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.560
 fabric 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.390
 sew around the flap and finish off 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.519
 use the narrowest point if you 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.519
 prefer that the seam is stronger 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.590
 of the flexible points are used 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.390
 mainly for knitting and 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.880
 elastic tissues such as those 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.489
 used to make knitted t-shirts 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.400
 Cotton Beachwear and Lingerie 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.910
 flexible stitches include straight stitching 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.910
 elastic or ric rap the overlock type point 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.310
 tilted the pen point to the left and the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.979
 elastic point of basting let's see 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.740
 close to some of these flexible points 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.440
 the elastic point of basting makes a 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.140
 posture and finish at the same time is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.510
 Great for sewing flexible fabrics 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.419
 which require that the point accompanies its 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.940
 elasticity make seam at the edge 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.020
 the tissue and cut the excess tissue 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.060
 when it finishes the point the weather is great 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.570
 to apply an elastic in beach fashion 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.789
 lingerie and even in children's clothing 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.100
 pass the elastic through the hole of the 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.979
 sneaker taking the back of the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.800
 sneaker secures the tip of the latium with 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.600
 one hand and pull the other side with the other 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.810
 hand toward you 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.789
 pulling on the elastic while sewing the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.310
 will follow the elasticity of the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.310
 elastic fabric in final result 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.920
 negative points are used 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.260
 mainly to decorate their 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.720
 works with the wide variety of 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.760
 lines and colors you can 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.650
 transform the appearance of dots 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.540
 also combining points 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.900
 you can create nozzle effects 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.630
 in other decorations some 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.760
 utilitarian and flexible points can be 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.700
 used as decorative dots 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.230
 let's see some of these points 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.690
 with a thicker line 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.700
 such as those of stitch you 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.350
 you'll be able to create a beautiful 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.970
 increasing point 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.980
 do not forget to use a needle 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.480
 thick so the line passes through it 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.820
 more easily 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.000
 the game between the screen not sticky and 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.740
 stitching and cutting stabilizer remove 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.720
 fabric around the point with a 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.720
 fine-needle embroidery scissors 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:17.950
 you can also sew on ribbons 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.600
 and edges use polyester rayon line 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.060
 to match the brightness similar to the 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.100
 of the tape 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.470
 try making new point combinations 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.110
 and the Caribbean with the different ones 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:35.090
 perfect in the decoration of your home clothes 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.640
 and handicrafts will earn several points 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.130
 look totally different if you 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.700
 use thicker line on the coil as 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.520
 an embroidery line could crochet fill to 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.330
 coil sew on the wrong side of the 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.510
 job 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:54.490
 the result will be a beautiful 3D way 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.490
 on the right side of work
