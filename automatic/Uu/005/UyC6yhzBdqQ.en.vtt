00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
rabbits sharing one litter box so it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020 
rabbits sharing one litter box so it
really<00:01:31.470> depends<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.399> many<00:01:32.490> rabbits<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
really depends on how many rabbits you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.740 
really depends on how many rabbits you
have<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.140> poop<00:01:34.649> or<00:01:34.799> pee<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:36.360> etc

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
have how much they poop or pee and etc

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.370 
have how much they poop or pee and etc
so<00:01:39.860> also<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.399> try<00:01:41.610> cleaning<00:01:41.670> their

based palates and like yesterday's news
and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.980> don't<00:02:24.219> think<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.549> works<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:25.120> good<00:02:25.930> at

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and I don't think it works as good at

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440 
and I don't think it works as good at
all<00:02:26.379> but<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:27.129> really<00:02:27.340> your<00:02:27.579> own<00:02:27.640> preference

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
all but it's really your own preference

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
all but it's really your own preference

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
so just try different letters out and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.190 
so just try different letters out and
see<00:02:30.459> which<00:02:30.609> ones<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.849> like<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.150> best<00:02:31.329> don't

good<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:45.879> rabbits

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
good for rabbits

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.640 
good for rabbits
some<00:02:48.129> people<00:02:48.489> use<00:02:49.019> stuff<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.349> put<00:02:50.530> in

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
some people use stuff that you put in

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.229 
some people use stuff that you put in
the<00:02:50.739> water<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.250> make<00:02:51.430> their<00:02:51.579> pee<00:02:51.790> smell<00:02:52.060> better

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
the water to make their pee smell better

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.240 
the water to make their pee smell better
I<00:02:52.620> strongly<00:02:53.639> do<00:02:54.639> not<00:02:54.819> recommend<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.569> because

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
I strongly do not recommend this because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.039 
I strongly do not recommend this because
first<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.459> all<00:02:57.579> if<00:02:57.939> you<00:02:58.299> put<00:02:58.599> something<00:02:58.959> in

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
first of all if you put something in

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.170 
first of all if you put something in
your<00:02:59.079> rabbits<00:02:59.590> water<00:02:59.799> they<00:03:00.099> may<00:03:00.280> not<00:03:00.489> drink<00:03:00.939> as

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
your rabbits water they may not drink as

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.530 
your rabbits water they may not drink as
up<00:03:01.359> as<00:03:01.629> much<00:03:01.930> as<00:03:02.230> they<00:03:02.379> used<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:03.209> or<00:03:04.209> they'll

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
up as much as they used to or they'll

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.220 
up as much as they used to or they'll
stop<00:03:04.870> drinking<00:03:05.379> altogether<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:07.780> they

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
stop drinking altogether and also they

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.069 
stop drinking altogether and also they
do<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.469> they<00:03:08.980> most<00:03:09.219> likely<00:03:09.430> will<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.879> work<00:03:10.239> so

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
do not they most likely will not work so

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.649 
do not they most likely will not work so
it's<00:03:11.859> really<00:03:12.040> pointless<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.909> I<00:03:13.150> strongly

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
it's really pointless so I strongly

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.550 
it's really pointless so I strongly
recommend<00:03:14.439> not<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> use<00:03:15.750> anything<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
recommend not to use anything that you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.959 
recommend not to use anything that you
put<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.859> their<00:03:17.980> water<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.769> next<00:03:21.430> another<00:03:21.730> thing

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
put in their water so next another thing

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.390 
put in their water so next another thing
you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.150> try<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.659> a<00:03:23.139> fan<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.769> an<00:03:23.919> open<00:03:24.220> window

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
you can try is a fan in an open window

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.379 
you can try is a fan in an open window
and<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.500> helps<00:03:26.859> circulate<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.549> air<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.729> get

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
and this helps circulate the air and get

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.750 
and this helps circulate the air and get
the<00:03:28.599> like<00:03:29.139> airflow<00:03:29.650> through<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.220> room<00:03:30.430> and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the like airflow through the room and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.409 
the like airflow through the room and
helps<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.930> helps<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.319> odor<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.680> lot<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.790> during

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
helps it helps with odor a lot so during

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.210 
helps it helps with odor a lot so during
the<00:03:34.510> summer<00:03:34.689> my<00:03:34.989> window<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.500> mostly<00:03:35.829> always

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the summer my window is mostly always

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.259 
the summer my window is mostly always
open<00:03:36.729> unless<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.389> really<00:03:37.720> hot<00:03:37.900> outside<00:03:38.079> or

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
a bowl of vinegar I used to do that but

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
I started smelling like like a vinegar

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.820 
I started smelling like like a vinegar
smell<00:04:28.240> every<00:04:28.599> time<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.840> walked<00:04:29.139> in<00:04:29.289> my<00:04:29.320> room<00:04:29.440> and
