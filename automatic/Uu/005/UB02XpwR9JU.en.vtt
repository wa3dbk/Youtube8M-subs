okay<00:00:00.780> let<00:00:00.930> us<00:00:00.960> continue<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.650> investigation

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.030 
okay let us continue this investigation

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.150 
okay let us continue this investigation
into<00:00:03.380> gravity<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.920> understand<00:00:05.490> or<00:00:05.700> gravity<00:00:06.210> is

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
into gravity to understand or gravity is

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.839 
into gravity to understand or gravity is
its<00:00:08.160> fundamental<00:00:08.820> nature<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.269> cause<00:00:10.639> we<00:00:11.639> must

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
its fundamental nature and cause we must

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
its fundamental nature and cause we must
start<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.330> examining<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.950> fundamental

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
start by examining the fundamental

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.840 
start by examining the fundamental
nature<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> universe<00:00:14.490> itself<00:00:16.699> we<00:00:17.699> know

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
nature of the universe itself we know

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.620 
nature of the universe itself we know
that<00:00:17.880> gravity<00:00:18.449> seen<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.020> attractive<00:00:19.560> force

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
that gravity seen as an attractive force

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.200 
that gravity seen as an attractive force
and<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:22.020> acts<00:00:22.260> between<00:00:22.470> particles<00:00:23.210> simply

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and this acts between particles simply

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.160 
and this acts between particles simply
because<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.140> mass<00:00:26.420> as<00:00:27.420> postulated<00:00:27.750> by

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
because they have mass as postulated by

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.889 
because they have mass as postulated by
Isaac<00:00:28.710> Newton<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> between<00:00:31.050> any<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.619> masses

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
Isaac Newton so between any two masses

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.220 
Isaac Newton so between any two masses
we<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.980> attractive<00:00:35.579> force<00:00:36.079> what<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
we see an attractive force what we

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.770 
we see an attractive force what we
actually<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.550> acceleration

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
actually see is an acceleration

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.950 
actually see is an acceleration
of<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.680> masses<00:00:42.070> towards<00:00:42.489> each<00:00:42.579> other

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.680 

by<00:00:45.500> Newton's<00:00:45.860> second<00:00:46.309> law<00:00:46.340> an<00:00:47.059> acceleration

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
by Newton's second law an acceleration

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.180 
by Newton's second law an acceleration
of<00:00:47.899> a<00:00:48.020> mass<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:49.340> caused<00:00:49.699> by<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.000> force<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.949> the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
of a mass is caused by a force and the

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.299 
of a mass is caused by a force and the
magnitude<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.149> force<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:54.190> simply<00:00:55.190> its

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
magnitude of this force is simply its

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.119 
magnitude of this force is simply its
mass<00:00:55.610> times<00:00:56.120> its<00:00:56.420> acceleration<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> mass

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
mass times its acceleration so the mass

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.540 
mass times its acceleration so the mass
accelerates<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.900> direction<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:03.589> this

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
accelerates in the direction of this

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.130 
accelerates in the direction of this
force

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
force

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.980 
force
we<00:01:07.010> calculate<00:01:07.580> our<00:01:07.760> acceleration<00:01:08.300> by

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
we calculate our acceleration by

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.840 
we calculate our acceleration by
dividing<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.560> force<00:01:10.030> by<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.090> mass<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.610> for<00:01:13.820> a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
dividing the force by the mass but for a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.410 
dividing the force by the mass but for a
mass<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.270> free<00:01:14.540> fall<00:01:16.090> Newton<00:01:17.090> saw<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
mass in free fall Newton saw the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.210 
mass in free fall Newton saw the
acceleration<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.380> mass<00:01:18.590> particle

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
acceleration of a mass particle

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.960 
acceleration of a mass particle
downwards<00:01:20.000> towards<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.479> F<00:01:20.630> therefore<00:01:21.729> he<00:01:22.729> saw

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
downwards towards the F therefore he saw

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 
downwards towards the F therefore he saw
it<00:01:23.090> as<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.210> force<00:01:23.600> which<00:01:24.020> he<00:01:24.140> called<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.560> force

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
it as a force which he called the force

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.890 
it as a force which he called the force
of<00:01:25.220> gravity<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.490> simply<00:01:28.909> because<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:29.690> this

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
of gravity so simply because that this

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.450 
of gravity so simply because that this
mass<00:01:30.520> was<00:01:31.520> accelerating<00:01:32.800> he<00:01:33.800> described<00:01:34.250> this

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
mass was accelerating he described this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.060 
mass was accelerating he described this
as<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.940> force<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:36.009> gravity

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.840 

so<00:01:40.670> we<00:01:40.820> are<00:01:40.909> using<00:01:41.530> evidence<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.850> acceleration

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
so we are using evidence of acceleration

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
so we are using evidence of acceleration
free<00:01:44.570> for<00:01:44.900> as<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:46.100> evidence<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.840> gravity<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
free for as the evidence the gravity is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.630 
free for as the evidence the gravity is
a<00:01:48.530> force<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:50.900> fact<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.620> observe<00:01:51.890> gravity

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
a force but in fact we observe gravity

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.160 
a force but in fact we observe gravity
as<00:01:52.940> an<00:01:53.360> acceleration<00:01:55.210> which<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.420> only<00:01:56.690> presume

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
as an acceleration which we only presume

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.290 
as an acceleration which we only presume
to<00:01:57.560> be<00:01:57.650> caused<00:01:57.860> by<00:01:58.130> force<00:01:58.460> which<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.060> called

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
to be caused by force which we called

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.020 
to be caused by force which we called
gravity<00:02:02.110> what<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.259> really<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:03.800> in<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
gravity what we really see in is the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.090 
gravity what we really see in is the
mass<00:02:05.979> accelerating

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.000 

so<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.250> gravity<00:02:10.670> driven<00:02:10.940> by<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> force

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
so is gravity driven by a force

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.170 
so is gravity driven by a force
according<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.040> Newton<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.670> answer<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.000> course

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
according to Newton the answer of course

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.750 
according to Newton the answer of course
is<00:02:14.390> yes<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.140> according<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.620> Einstein<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.520> is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
is yes but according to Einstein it is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.360 
is yes but according to Einstein it is
simply<00:02:17.120> an<00:02:17.210> acceleration<00:02:18.040> caused<00:02:19.040> by<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
simply an acceleration caused by the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.730 
simply an acceleration caused by the
curvature<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.860> space-time<00:02:22.280> geometric

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
space-time vacuum by Einstein we know

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.920 
space-time vacuum by Einstein we know
that<00:02:28.040> any<00:02:28.250> particle<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> mass<00:02:31.660> gives<00:02:32.660> the

there's no gravity space-time appears

there's no gravity space-time appears
