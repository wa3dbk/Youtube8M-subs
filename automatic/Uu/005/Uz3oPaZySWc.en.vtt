00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.980
 Hey there 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm in the video today and will teach you how to do it. 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650
 Paper copies 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.439
 I think I think everybody 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 learned how to make a paper cup in a 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:35.360
 back to the area at school but 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 Let's do is get rid of the process. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.239
 so the only thing we're going to need 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.239
 only one sheet 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.780
 with a pair of scissors and a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.110
 we want to customize our glasses 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.009
 challenge when falling into thinking like a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 leaf 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.640
 of these to 4 simple is rectangular 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:25.250
 we need to say square by 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.250
 I do not expect a tip and a way 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:52.660
 was the tip was mother knew wine has 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.570
 in the chart this corner and then this 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.020
 side here has to hit right is that 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.240
 so I'll have a car visit later 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.240
 even can be with this part of the treasure 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.760
 so this is it is the first step 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:19.470
 now it's clear that you know down here 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 close this one we will turn upside down 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.350
 and fold double that match 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.810
 So you have to be well come here because 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 now it is our external choice 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.770
 they did not cut back from the treasury 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.770
 serve them with banana 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.370
 this paper framework we will no longer need 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.239
 more 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.690
 now we're going to start it all starts with 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.280
 to the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.930
 we already have the correct exit now should 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.930
 start working on glasses 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:23.340
 part of these men to double since there is 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.340
 this pretty delicate before facing 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:41.950
 there is to help me and now taking a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.950
 plant than the UK fifth but there 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:04:01.180
 at this point the little boy is very happy 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:13.490
 I'm not your rock spot. 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 now we turn this letter upside down 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.480
 We just turned now to the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:25.280
 otherwise we do the same thing 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:32.060
 psd we always look at this tip 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:45.680
 we put center players only in this 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:47.900
 tip and put of texts and without direction 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.100
 right in favor of having it again 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.100
 understood to do better 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:14.400
 and I always do badly 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:17.520
 is the way people like that happened to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.630
 first phase do not have as much until 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:37.220
 even I decided to do it ok now we are looking for 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:37.220
 so it will take less 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:53.930
 these will also have made you our 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.930
 glasses is super easy
