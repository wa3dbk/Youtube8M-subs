00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.439
 today we are going to prepare a delicious 

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.480
 Ecuadorian ceviche that is perfect for 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.880
 the summer time and for that I'm going to 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.070
 take first of all some of the 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.469
 vegetables that I'm going to use purple onion 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.119
 because dwelling because in this case what 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.650
 I want to give a little color to the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.060
 final product because because the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.920
 presentation is very important but 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.560
 besides it using purple onion 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.210
 we are going to have an onion that is not so 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.570
 intense as the onion can be 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.510
 yellow then we cut some strips 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.640
 of onion then at the beginning we're going to 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.350
 have the perfect plasters but 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.240
 as we are getting to the middle of the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.520
 onion let's have what it's going to be 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.440
 this bit that keeps the onion 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.950
 all together then for that we cut 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.780
 that amulet and then we separate the onion 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.520
 in a julienne cut a classic cut 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.200
 traditional and what I'm going to do is 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
 start placing all the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.950
 ingredients in a container this is 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.980
 a very simple recipe to prepare 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.960
 super refreshing perfect to serve 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 in the yard if you're sitting outside 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.590
 your wonderful home 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.780
 and now what we're going to do is start 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.070
 to add the seasonings for our 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.920
 shrimp that are going to make the ingredient 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.080
 main of today's ceviche for the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.119
 dressing let's start with ketchup and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.700
 we will add it directly on top 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.229
 of the onion and here we are going to start 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
 place the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.220
 so that they leave to marry 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 so they can take a little bit of the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.979
 flavor of each one of them let's take 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.240
 I'm going to cut the orange in half and 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.560
 a trick that I give you so you do not get 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.549
 go none of those seeds that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.130
 when we write the orange 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.539
 we just put our hands and that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.310
 way we're going to stay with all the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.720
 seeds in the hand and not in our 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 ceviche because it is not pleasant at all 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.409
 then we add the juice of the orange 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.330
 that in this case is going to give a touch 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.390
 bittersweet and it's the wonderful thing about this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 Ecuadorian ceviche that unlike 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.569
 Other ceviche as is the ceviche 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.729
 Peruvian Mexican law has notes 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.980
 sweet then I'll take the juice of a 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.110
 lemon 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.900
 to squeeze the lemon take a fork 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 like this one we put it in the middle and 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.720
 then what we do in turn what 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 lightly to remove as much 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 of the possible juice there is and now 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.970
 ingredients that we do not see in any other 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.860
 Ceviche is the mustard let's add 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 a teaspoon of mustard mustard is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.770
 the ingredient that makes the difference 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.350
 in this ceviche because he is going to tell you 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm trying something different but I do not know 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 Exactly what it is is going to give you another 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 flavor dimension once we have 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.140
 this here we are going to session of course 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.940
 with a touch of black pepper salt and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.920
 then I will add another form of acid 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 in this case it's vinegar 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.060
 add about 8% one 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.950
 teaspoon of vinegar then we go to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.380
 add a touch of olive oil to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.210
 final what we are going to do is mix what 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.040
 what is going to be the dressing or what could 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.930
 call as a kind of vinaigrette and 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 to finish of course what 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.200
 we do is add the ingredient 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.700
 main that in this case are about 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.050
 shrimp I'm using some shrimp 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.569
 that we get for the cooked in the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.900
 supermarket we add that out there 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.450
 we mix well let's add the touch 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.680
 final is present in all those 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.719
 rights that we mentioned in the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 Mexican in the Peruvian and is the cilantro 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.230
 a very aromatic herb 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.959
 very popular in Latin America in our 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.030
 kitchen and what we do is cut it to the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.640
 last second just before using it 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.190
 to make the most of its aromas 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.379
 of its perfume and not mistreat the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 leave it exposed outdoors then 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.630
 what we do is that we add the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 cilantro and mix well a recipe 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.910
