00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.140 

okay<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:01.770> earthquake<00:00:02.399> 80<00:00:05.150> after

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
okay this is my earthquake 80 after

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.270 
okay this is my earthquake 80 after
tearing<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.540> down<00:00:06.569> having<00:00:07.379> problems<00:00:07.830> with

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.360 

gears<00:00:12.349> chipping<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.590> teeth<00:00:13.799> off<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
gears chipping the teeth off this is the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.390 
gears chipping the teeth off this is the
rear<00:00:14.639> diff<00:00:15.020> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.410> third<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> I've<00:00:16.980> had<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
rear diff of the third one I've had and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
rear diff of the third one I've had and
looks<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.150> doing<00:00:18.240> okay<00:00:18.800> if<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
looks like it's doing okay if you can

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.820 
looks like it's doing okay if you can
tell<00:00:20.340> I've<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:21.029> three<00:00:21.960> shims<00:00:24.680> where<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
tell I've got three shims where the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.609 
tell I've got three shims where the
pinion<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.779> that<00:00:27.779> seems<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pinion is and that seems like it's a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410 
pinion is and that seems like it's a
little<00:00:28.800> tight<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.519> may<00:00:29.730> come<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.000> off

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
little tight so I may come back off

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030 
little tight so I may come back off
there<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.529> everybody<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
there but one thing I want everybody to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.760 
there but one thing I want everybody to
see<00:00:32.870> is<00:00:37.460> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.790 

you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.820> far<00:00:42.060> across<00:00:43.490> it<00:00:44.490> comes<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
you can see how far across it comes so

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.850 
you can see how far across it comes so
trying<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.830> figure<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.880> shim

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
trying to figure out what how to shim

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.880 
trying to figure out what how to shim
this<00:00:49.860> from<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> side-to-side<00:00:50.550> motion

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
this from the side-to-side motion

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.970 
this from the side-to-side motion
same<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.130> front<00:00:53.310> diff<00:00:54.830> but<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:56.040> can<00:00:56.190> see

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
same with the front diff but you can see

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
same with the front diff but you can see
if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.379> that's<00:01:01.379> tight

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
if you look there and that's tight

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
if you look there and that's tight
definitely<00:01:02.280> too<00:01:02.430> tight

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
definitely too tight

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.410 
definitely too tight
as<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.260> see

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.690 

have<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> few

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.890 

chips<00:01:15.700> right<00:01:16.120> there<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.420> that's<00:01:19.570> probably

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
chips right there and that's probably

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.550 
chips right there and that's probably
from<00:01:20.200> being<00:01:20.470> too<00:01:20.950> tight<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.170> one<00:01:23.350> also

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
from being too tight but this one also

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.730 
from being too tight but this one also
does<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.370> back<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:24.760> forth

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.560 

I<00:01:32.770> guess<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.640> just<00:01:33.820> easy<00:01:34.030> enough<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.330> to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
I guess it's just easy enough just to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
I guess it's just easy enough just to
show<00:01:34.780> them<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.110> don't<00:01:35.470> know<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:36.940> my<00:01:37.060> other

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
show them I don't know here my other

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.940 
show them I don't know here my other
diffs<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> had<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.540> there<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:43.950> pretty

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
diffs that I had in there pretty pretty

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
diffs that I had in there pretty pretty
easy<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.400> them<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.910> think<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.050> am<00:01:47.260> but<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:49.450> here's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
easy on them I think I am but now here's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.740 
easy on them I think I am but now here's
here's<00:01:51.970> another

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
here's another

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.000 
here's another
either<00:01:54.380> one<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.710> had<00:01:54.950> right<00:01:55.190> there<00:01:57.010> and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
either one that I had right there and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.060 
either one that I had right there and
see<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.370> one<00:01:58.490> had<00:01:58.670> every<00:01:59.090> all<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.510> teeth

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
see that one had every all the teeth

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:09.199 
see that one had every all the teeth
should<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.130> right<00:02:01.310> off<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:01.730> it<00:02:03.370> so<00:02:05.050> same<00:02:06.050> with

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.100 

it's<00:02:09.750> named<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> fat<00:02:10.140> one<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:11.640> there

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.449 

if<00:02:16.110> anybody<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.680> give<00:02:17.640> me<00:02:17.730> an<00:02:17.819> idea<00:02:18.319> both<00:02:19.459> both

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
if anybody can give me an idea both both

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.500 
if anybody can give me an idea both both
opinions<00:02:23.209> are<00:02:24.950> pretty<00:02:25.950> tight

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
opinions are pretty tight

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.630 
opinions are pretty tight
there's<00:02:27.510> no<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:28.769> moving<00:02:29.069> right<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
there's no I'm moving right there and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.750 
there's no I'm moving right there and
there's<00:02:29.760> no<00:02:29.909> play<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.480> that's<00:02:30.659> probably<00:02:31.760> way

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
there's no play so that's probably way

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.970 
there's no play so that's probably way
too<00:02:32.790> tight<00:02:36.049> it's<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.109> little<00:02:37.560> bit<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.799> play

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
too tight it's a little bit of play

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.819 
too tight it's a little bit of play
right<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.909> see<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:40.620> this

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
right there as you can see but this

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.059 
right there as you can see but this
whole<00:02:41.069> signed<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.519> signed<00:02:41.760> deal<00:02:42.950> that's<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
whole signed a signed deal that's a

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
whole signed a signed deal that's a
little<00:02:44.220> excessive<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.790> would<00:02:44.940> guess<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.450> don't

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
little excessive I would guess I don't

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.280 
little excessive I would guess I don't
know<00:02:46.280> anybody
