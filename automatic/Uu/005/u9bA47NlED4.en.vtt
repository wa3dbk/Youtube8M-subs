00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
different ways of playing disorient and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.790 
different ways of playing disorient and
that's<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.809> wanted<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> address<00:00:16.410> today

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
that's what we wanted to address today

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.070 
that's what we wanted to address today
there's<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> way<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.539> rotate<00:00:18.840> your

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
there's the way of you can rotate your

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.810 
there's the way of you can rotate your
phone<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
phone like this or you can do the you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.429 
phone like this or you can do the you
know<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> steering<00:00:21.660> wheel<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.140> home<00:00:22.289> two

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
know the steering wheel to home two

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
know the steering wheel to home two
hands<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.100> rotate<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.350> we

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
hands you can rotate like this but we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.609 
hands you can rotate like this but we
found<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> best<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:27.619> play

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
found the best way is to actually play

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
found the best way is to actually play
pretty<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> game<00:00:30.060> labyrinth

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pretty much like the game labyrinth

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
pretty much like the game labyrinth
where<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.410> hold<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.890> phone<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
where you actually hold your phone like

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.120 
where you actually hold your phone like
this<00:00:32.510> now<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> does<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> allows<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this now what that does is it allows you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
this now what that does is it allows you
to<00:00:35.250> use<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.610> four<00:00:35.820> axes<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> quick<00:00:36.719> easy

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to use all four axes in a quick easy

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
to use all four axes in a quick easy
manner<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> orient<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> does<00:00:39.149> have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
manner now this orient it does have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
manner now this orient it does have
running<00:00:39.809> where<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> touch<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.670> screen

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
running where you can touch the screen

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360 
running where you can touch the screen
to<00:00:41.969> run<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> character<00:00:44.070> running

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
to run you can see the character running

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060 
to run you can see the character running
back<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> forth<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.809> touch<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> run<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
back and forth you can touch the run you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
back and forth you can touch the run you
can<00:00:47.219> tilt<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> run<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.600> turn<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.110> fall

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
can tilt it to run and you turn to fall

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
can tilt it to run and you turn to fall
everyone<00:00:50.039> knows<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:50.489> disorient<00:00:51.059> by

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
everyone knows that about disorient by

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.680 
everyone knows that about disorient by
now<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.079> how<00:00:52.739> does<00:00:52.879> disoriented<00:00:53.879> work<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.420> it's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
now so how does disoriented work if it's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
now so how does disoriented work if it's
being<00:00:55.230> held<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:56.090> well<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> good

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
being held down well that's a good

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.310 
being held down well that's a good
question<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.680> let's<00:00:58.890> find<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.170> we're

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
question so let's find out so now we're

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.529 
question so let's find out so now we're
holding<00:01:01.559> disorient<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> turn<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
holding disorient down when you turn the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.770 
holding disorient down when you turn the
phone<00:01:03.960> you'll<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.400> disoriented<00:01:06.090> moves

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
phone you'll see that disoriented moves

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
phone you'll see that disoriented moves
in<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:08.780> perpendicular<00:01:09.780> angles<00:01:10.310> meaning

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
in more perpendicular angles meaning

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.060 
in more perpendicular angles meaning
that<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.790> falls<00:01:12.630> left<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that it just falls left to right up to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
that it just falls left to right up to
down<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.930> precise

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
down so this way you get your precise

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
down so this way you get your precise
movements<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> move<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.270> into

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
movements and you can move right into

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
movements and you can move right into
the<00:01:18.630> doors<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> harder<00:01:19.979> levels

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the doors on the on the harder levels

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.850 
the doors on the on the harder levels
now<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.600> tricky<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.080> rubber

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
now this is a bit tricky because rubber

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
now this is a bit tricky because rubber
down<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.340> always<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> turn<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
down is always down so if you turn the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.550 
down is always down so if you turn the
phone<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:27.509> side<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
phone like this this side right here is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
phone like this this side right here is
down<00:01:28.829> turn<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.720> side

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
down turn it like this then this side

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.859 
down turn it like this then this side
right<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.890> down<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
right here is down so you just have to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
right here is down so you just have to
keep<00:01:33.990> remembering<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.799> down<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.820> if

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
keep remembering that down is down so if

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
keep remembering that down is down so if
you're<00:01:36.090> following<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> want

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you're following this way and you want

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
you're following this way and you want
to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.250> 180<00:01:38.729> degree<00:01:39.000> turn<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.049> turn<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to do 180 degree turn you turn it this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.140 
to do 180 degree turn you turn it this
way<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.700> even<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
way and you see it you can even see the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.450 
way and you see it you can even see the
menu<00:01:42.329> flip<00:01:42.689> around<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> go

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
menu flip around so I'm going to go

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.170 
menu flip around so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> restart<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> level<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
ahead and restart the level here so that
