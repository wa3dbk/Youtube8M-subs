well here we are in Lightroom again we
are<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.460> library<00:00:33.880> module<00:00:34.060> I<00:00:34.450> have

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
are in the library module I have

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.330 
are in the library module I have
imported<00:00:35.110> one<00:00:35.470> photograph<00:00:35.980> for<00:00:36.190> this

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340

tutorial<00:00:36.880> I've<00:00:37.690> already<00:00:38.140> added<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.560> couple<00:00:38.770> of

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
tutorial I've already added a couple of

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.830 
tutorial I've already added a couple of
key<00:00:39.010> words<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:39.850> let's<00:00:40.060> move<00:00:40.210> on<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.600> the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
key words so let's move on to the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.880 
key words so let's move on to the
development<00:00:41.350> module<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:44.350> right

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
development module all right

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.500 
development module all right
the<00:00:45.190> very<00:00:45.400> first<00:00:45.670> thing<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.090> notice<00:00:46.450> about

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
the very first thing that I notice about

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.330 
the very first thing that I notice about
this<00:00:46.720> photograph<00:00:46.960> is<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.830> taken<00:00:48.160> in<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
this photograph is it was taken in the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.710 
this photograph is it was taken in the
middle<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.670> day<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.420> was<00:00:49.540> bright

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
middle of the day and it was bright

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.990 
middle of the day and it was bright
outside<00:00:50.199> that's<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.280> problem<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.970> have

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
outside that's a problem when you have

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.580 
outside that's a problem when you have
black<00:00:52.809> areas<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.800> white<00:00:54.670> areas<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.930> contrast

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
black areas and white areas the contrast

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.640 
black areas and white areas the contrast
range<00:00:56.949> between<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.150> two<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.750> difficult<00:00:59.440> for

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
range between the two is difficult for

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.640 
range between the two is difficult for
the<00:00:59.710> camera<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:01.210> record<00:01:01.360> especially<00:01:02.110> on

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
the camera to record especially on

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.080 
the camera to record especially on
bright<00:01:02.890> days<00:01:04.590> there<00:01:05.590> are<00:01:05.710> ways<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.090> overcome

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
bright days there are ways to overcome

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.060 
bright days there are ways to overcome
that<00:01:07.270> using<00:01:08.050> this<00:01:08.140> program<00:01:08.350> we'll<00:01:08.710> discuss

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
that using this program we'll discuss

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.280 
that using this program we'll discuss
that<00:01:09.100> in<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.120> moment<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.930> first<00:01:11.050> thing

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
that in just a moment the first thing

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.380 
that in just a moment the first thing
that<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.500> noticed<00:01:11.860> about<00:01:12.400> this<00:01:12.700> photograph<00:01:12.940> is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that I noticed about this photograph is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.820 
that I noticed about this photograph is
that<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.720> is<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> bit<00:01:14.140> dark<00:01:15.780> phrase<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
that it is a bit dark phrase the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.010 
that it is a bit dark phrase the
exposure<00:01:18.220> there's<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.060> problem<00:01:19.330> when<00:01:19.720> we<00:01:19.810> raise

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
exposure there's a problem when we raise

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.070 
exposure there's a problem when we raise
the<00:01:20.049> exposure<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:22.390> still<00:01:22.600> have<00:01:22.750> some<00:01:22.900> black

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the exposure we still have some black

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.469 
the exposure we still have some black
areas<00:01:23.470> but<00:01:23.920> now<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.460> some<00:01:24.610> soup<00:01:25.000> or<00:01:25.299> white

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
areas but now we have some soup or white

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.050 
areas but now we have some soup or white
areas<00:01:25.870> I<00:01:26.110> would<00:01:26.830> bet<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.340> some<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:27.760> is

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
areas I would bet that some of that is

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.690 
areas I would bet that some of that is
clipped<00:01:28.840> clipping<00:01:29.830> means<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.369> you've<00:01:30.520> blown

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
clipped clipping means that you've blown

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.160 
clipped clipping means that you've blown
out<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:30.940> highlights<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.630> have<00:01:31.780> no<00:01:31.960> data

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
out the highlights and you have no data

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.370 
out the highlights and you have no data
there's<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.190> way<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.549> tell<00:01:33.909> in<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.990> upper

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
there's a way you can tell in the upper

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.080 
there's a way you can tell in the upper
right<00:01:35.530> hand<00:01:35.560> side<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.370> histogram<00:01:36.790> area

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
right hand side and the histogram area

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.510 
right hand side and the histogram area
you'll<00:01:37.360> see<00:01:37.540> an<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.780> arrow<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.340> hover

over it and it'll show you some of the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.070 
over it and it'll show you some of the
areas<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.920> can<00:01:42.070> click<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.930> will

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.770 
something needs to happen there's a
quick<00:01:52.000> way<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:52.150> we<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.540> do<00:01:52.630> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
quick way that we can do that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.270 
quick way that we can do that
considering<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.680> small<00:01:53.920> part<00:01:54.130> of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
considering it's just a small part of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.300 
considering it's just a small part of
this<00:01:54.400> image<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> recovery<00:01:57.010> slider

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
this image there is a recovery slider

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.690 
this image there is a recovery slider
just<00:01:58.060> below<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.510> exposure<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
just below the exposure this is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.240 
just below the exposure this is
specifically<00:02:01.510> for<00:02:01.630> highlights<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.740> as<00:02:03.010> I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
specifically for highlights and as I

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.670 
specifically for highlights and as I
raise<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.910> see<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.270> red<00:02:04.450> areas<00:02:04.870> begin

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
raise it you can see the red areas begin

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.040 
raise it you can see the red areas begin
to<00:02:06.010> go<00:02:06.160> away<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.730> don't<00:02:07.450> want<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.720> raise<00:02:07.840> it

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
very minor changes mostly in the green

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.449 
very minor changes mostly in the green
here<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.700> then<00:04:16.060> saturation<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:17.769> do<00:04:17.919> just<00:04:18.280> a

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
here and then saturation will do just a

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.240 
here and then saturation will do just a
hair<00:04:18.729> saturation<00:04:19.450> you'll<00:04:20.320> see<00:04:20.560> most<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.070> that

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
hair saturation you'll see most of that

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.250 
hair saturation you'll see most of that
here<00:04:24.250> in<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.460> brown<00:04:24.669> areas<00:04:25.090> there's<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.990> quick

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
here in the brown areas there's a quick

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.290 
here in the brown areas there's a quick
way<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.440> see<00:04:26.590> how<00:04:27.070> far<00:04:27.280> you've<00:04:27.490> come<00:04:27.520> with<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
way to see how far you've come with the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.870 
way to see how far you've come with the
image<00:04:28.570> hit<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.470> backslash<00:04:29.919> key<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
image hit the backslash key on the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.750 
image hit the backslash key on the
keyboard<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:32.520> it'll<00:04:33.520> give<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.640> a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
keyboard and it'll give you a

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.710 
keyboard and it'll give you a
before-and-after<00:04:35.729> I'd<00:04:36.729> say<00:04:37.330> we're<00:04:37.510> in<00:04:37.540> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
before-and-after I'd say we're in the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.780 
before-and-after I'd say we're in the
ballpark<00:04:37.840> let's<00:04:38.680> move<00:04:38.860> on<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.340> tonal<00:04:39.820> curve

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
ballpark let's move on to tonal curve

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.210 
ballpark let's move on to tonal curve
this<00:04:42.790> is<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:43.390> tonal<00:04:43.840> curve<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.290> is<00:04:44.440> typical<00:04:44.919> in

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
this is a tonal curve that is typical in

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.659 
this is a tonal curve that is typical in
most<00:04:45.880> photo<00:04:46.510> editing<00:04:46.900> software<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.620> am<00:04:48.190> NOT<00:04:48.520> an

most photo editing software I am NOT an

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.310 
most photo editing software I am NOT an
engineer<00:04:48.790> so<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.360> can't<00:04:49.600> give<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.780> all<00:04:50.020> the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
engineer so I can't give you all the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.770 
engineer so I can't give you all the
gory<00:04:51.070> details<00:04:51.130> about<00:04:51.880> what<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.210> curve<00:04:52.479> does

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
gory details about what this curve does

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.380 
gory details about what this curve does
what<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> can<00:04:53.410> tell<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.789> if<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.240> raise

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
what I can tell you is that if you raise

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.280 
what I can tell you is that if you raise
the<00:04:55.630> top<00:04:55.840> area

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
the top area

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.650 
the top area
you're<00:04:56.920> raising<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.430> light<00:04:57.640> if<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.480> raise

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
you're raising the light if you raise

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.450 
you're raising the light if you raise
the<00:04:58.690> lower<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.410> bottom<00:04:59.560> area<00:04:59.980> or<00:05:00.100> raise<00:05:00.250> the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the lower the bottom area or raise the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.280 
the lower the bottom area or raise the
bottom<00:05:00.610> area<00:05:01.030> you're<00:05:01.360> messing<00:05:02.110> with<00:05:02.140> the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
bottom area you're messing with the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.960 
bottom area you're messing with the
darks<00:05:02.530> this<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.190> where<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.670> control

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
darks this is where I like to control

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.330 
darks this is where I like to control
contrast<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:05.260> can<00:05:05.440> see<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.710> specifically

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
contrast you can see it specifically

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.070 
contrast you can see it specifically
right<00:05:06.520> below<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.180> changed<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.870> lights

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
right below it it's changed the lights

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.580 
right below it it's changed the lights
to<00:05:08.380> +6<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.220> darks<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.580> minus-8<00:05:10.260> again<00:05:11.260> you

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
to +6 and the darks to minus-8 again you

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.330 
to +6 and the darks to minus-8 again you
can<00:05:11.710> double<00:05:11.980> click<00:05:12.010> those<00:05:12.340> sliders<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:13.060> reset

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
can double click those sliders and reset

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.310 
can double click those sliders and reset
but<00:05:15.340> that's<00:05:15.640> just<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.940> quick<00:05:16.180> way<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.780> do<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.140> if

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
but that's just a quick way to do it if

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.810 
but that's just a quick way to do it if
you<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.620> certain<00:05:17.890> set<00:05:17.980> numbers<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.670> can

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
you have a certain set numbers you can

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.810 
you have a certain set numbers you can
go<00:05:18.970> plug<00:05:19.480> them<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.750> here<00:05:19.960> if<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.170> want<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.820> I'm

go plug them in here if you want to I'm

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.440 
go plug them in here if you want to I'm
pretty<00:05:22.090> well<00:05:22.270> happy<00:05:22.570> with<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:24.000> so<00:05:25.000> I<00:05:25.030> hope

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450
