00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:20.550
 Increasing the architectural design structure equipment say engineer the Thirds and Urban Planning 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.160
 We are of service 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.430
 of 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.390
 It is an old business that includes the business of design though 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.349
 a 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.059
 It looks like it has shrunk a little after the period of high economic growth 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.610
 With digital technology coming in, we are undergoing major changes 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:51.140
 Well I went to such a Fu 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:58.120
 Pressurized that corresponding production noble high-performance design 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 No doubt design If this fire protection is asked for a safe and secure design 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.170
 It can be said generally but 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:13.070
 It's a very analog technology, but it is 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.880
 Rather than truncating either, that old technology new together with new technology 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.619
 What is it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.130
 When we want to do the next generation ocean spreading design, how we think 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.549
 The product group of autodesk 3ds is yeah 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.440
 I wide variety of fields up to what age architectural design 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 Already 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.310
 I said it because the product is covered 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 It is extremely helpful to cover almost all areas of the product related to the construction. 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.640
 The 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.479
 In the old days, it was a two-dimensional time, but I tried to improve the design efficiency centering on autocads 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 is not it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.530
 So Well that it will move on to three-dimensional from two-dimensional in the current 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:57.690
 It is said in the industry that it is a bi-point or a game 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.840
 3-dimensional design greatly Well Shelley berth even took a now step 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.860
 Is its center Nanoha vivid So Cheri' 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.540
 a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.720
 By becoming the center of architecture and becoming the center of architectural design 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.200
 Let's go with us from the tool to draw the old year 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 A tool to think about architecture 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.210
 Say the kana area that is spreading 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.670
 That boom has only just begun, so many years from now 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.780
 I used the product of this company a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.440
 I think a lot of design army design district works come out 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.200
 It is speaking is in the charge of Mr. Well myself speaking at the moment 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.100
 and a Maho angulation museum it is carried out Come on production by the pit over almost the entire snake 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.690
 As a work that was considered and actually made 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.290
 This was also the subject of that person before 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.740
 In's a guy Tan 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 Well what is mentioned as a representative case now 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.840
 I put it in Es and I thought it was a daily routine 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.319
 A solution that has just begun a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:06.879
 There is a part that I am not used to, so I'm not really efficient. 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:11.349
 But still, yes, it's still the same as ever, when you want to design in different dimensions 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:15.830
 If you are not used to having the same period , you can achieve it 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.610
 If you get used to it, 20% and 30% will surely think English 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.240
 Also Is finger Tatsumi can measure not it 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.120
 There are always benefits of a big company 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.519
 Huh 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.080
 For example, if you use David and use a bit architecture with cast stone, the same data 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.030
 I'm Levit Strasser 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:39.440
 And saying that it can be used in Meritmete and cooperation is very good thing 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.330
 Not only that, but when visualizing it beyond the good looks 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.250
 I hope a max uses it Karaee 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:54.460
 Or the Well is good AutoCAD fifth year type well into the two-dimensional 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.510
 That data linkage is very important and of course the industry is listed, so it is now done even with peta linkage 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.130
 It is not 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.010
 I think the benefits of the software that are made of predominantly the same company if the current point Deie 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.350
 Well that 's still the biggest benefit 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.450
 And 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:13.000
 Kotoden that a large biasing the support it products 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:18.459
 I think I know is best to say construction of the business of rather essential that the cloud 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.260
 It was a domestic work in the instructor country, and it was a tongue job, but ours quickly 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.590
 Also in the field of architectural design 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.470
 Stars for example, in international global short 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.040
 Facilities are done in Hong Kong office and act in China 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.280
 But I went down and the costumes are fine as we did in Japan. 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.540
 For example, manufacturers are already scattered all over the world 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.230
 Is to have the data in the cloud or the service itself because 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:48.560
 Touch 4 free to the door turtle at the service itself of the tail on top of the cloud 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:52.910
 And if this time difference will not bother you will probably not bother with this regional difference 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.290
 Even if it's not a problem like love or hate, it's time to really get in trouble 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.740
 It is becoming a reality 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:02.300
 I think the cloud is delicious if you think so, and I also took an argument for the architectural business 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.610
 Both items 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.560
 Hmm 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:16.550
 In fact , I am doing a project on the order of one hundred construction numbers in a year. 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:21.110
 If the instructor key is fixed, I'm doing something close to 1 trillion yen, but actually it is 5% as of last year 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.020
 Day it somehow this year was successful in subordinates to the fact that do not you have to 30% 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.560
 Toka What is next year I Nattoru success function 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.550
 By Tsu 100 Pan but is more difficult I 100% 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.090
 By Well 100 par in the feeling 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.500
 Wim not a tool for a special project 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.030
 The tail part is certain when saying why I think that I use it for all the projects already 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.910
 Because we streamline our business then 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:49.000
 Easy-to-understand to perceived 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:51.690
 So you would move the 100% if possible Well, in a very large-up from next year 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.690
 The Fu that
