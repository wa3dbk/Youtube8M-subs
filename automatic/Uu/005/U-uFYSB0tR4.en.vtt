00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
in the freshly cooked twice yeah we
steer<00:01:35.340> sushi<00:01:35.759> vinegar<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> idea<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.020> we've

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
steer sushi vinegar so the idea is we've

for five simmer for 15 rested for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
for five simmer for 15 rested for
another<00:01:41.130> 10<00:01:41.369> we've<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> mixture<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.600> here

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
another 10 we've got a mixture in here

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
has been boiled subtle job now this is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
has been boiled subtle job now this is
an<00:01:48.119> interesting<00:01:48.210> process<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
an interesting process because the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
an interesting process because the
