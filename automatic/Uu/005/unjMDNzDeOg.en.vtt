00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
about making when I made this gun I made

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.740 
about making when I made this gun I made
it<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> tubes<00:00:58.530> thick<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.309> Uchitel<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it to tubes thick as Uchitel and the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
it to tubes thick as Uchitel and the
barrel<00:01:01.050> ended<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.410> being<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.829> tube<00:01:02.039> stick

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

that<00:01:02.640> goes<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> magazine<00:01:03.589> two<00:01:04.589> tubes<00:01:04.799> thick

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that goes the magazine two tubes thick

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
that goes the magazine two tubes thick
and<00:01:05.369> ended<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.760> looking<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> double

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and ended up looking like a double

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.280 
and ended up looking like a double
shotgun<00:01:06.869> almost<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.780> definitely<00:01:10.049> one

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
shotgun almost so that's definitely one

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
shotgun almost so that's definitely one
thing<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> did<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.520> made<00:01:11.909> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
thing I did not like about I made that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.160 
thing I did not like about I made that
gun<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.380> m-21<00:01:14.100> EVR<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.479> didn't<00:01:16.020> really

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gun this is my m-21 EVR I didn't really

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.910 
gun this is my m-21 EVR I didn't really
see<00:01:16.409> many<00:01:16.710> m-21<00:01:17.250> EBR<00:01:17.869> guns<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.140> there<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
see many m-21 EBR guns out there on

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.620 
see many m-21 EBR guns out there on
youtube<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.610> i<00:01:20.640> thought<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> hell<00:01:21.479> not

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
youtube so i thought why the hell not

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
youtube so i thought why the hell not
make<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.830> did<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> turned<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.820> out

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
make one and I did it turned it out

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.320 
make one and I did it turned it out
turned<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.170> turned<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.710> pretty<00:01:25.890> good

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
turned it out it turned out pretty good

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
turned it out it turned out pretty good
so<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:28.259> definitely<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.829> unique<00:01:29.189> gun

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so that's that's definitely a unique gun

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.679 
so that's that's definitely a unique gun

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
