level<00:04:23.290> or<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.680> pure<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.430> do<00:04:24.550> recommend<00:04:25.030> do<00:04:25.450> take

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
level or a pure I do recommend do take

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.440 
level or a pure I do recommend do take
some<00:04:25.990> food<00:04:26.230> they<00:04:26.890> sometimes<00:04:27.160> do<00:04:27.670> drop<00:04:27.880> bass<00:04:28.180> as

some food they sometimes do drop bass as
well<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.610> obviously<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.480> higher<00:04:31.630> range

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
well and but obviously the higher range

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.070 
well and but obviously the higher range
you<00:04:32.260> are<00:04:32.580> then<00:04:33.580> obviously<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.570> quickie<00:04:34.810> going

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
you are then obviously the quickie going

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.690 
you are then obviously the quickie going
to<00:04:35.140> kill<00:04:35.320> him<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.650> you're<00:04:35.830> obviously<00:04:36.220> quicker
