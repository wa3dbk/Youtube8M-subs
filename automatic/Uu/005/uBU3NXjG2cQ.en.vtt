00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello hello youtube friends today 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 I will teach to take the very important step 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.639
 let them know that you take the step with the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.920
 Pawns take the step when the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.260
 opponent moves them 2 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 two squares with his pawn when 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 come out with this row 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.330
 nothing not already we can take with 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.300
 our pawn then we can take the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:34.079
 step for example we have 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.560
 our pawn here if he moves us is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.860
 we can capture the step 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.260
 and this one is 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 it is taken diagonally 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 so you find the space that has traveled 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 the opponent's pawn and this one goes away 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.140
 very important that if we have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.590
 here 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.340
 and he plays us we can not 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.159
 capture here you can not say just be 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.940
 can when the opposite the us 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.000
 opponent moves us 292 squares already 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.880
 we can capture I will give them the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.240
 example in a game in which I will do 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.790
 Assuming the rival does that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.460
 well the jolla area like that to be able 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 show is the example although it is very little 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 probable but 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.820
 this catch the step can be done 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.670
 many times but but not so briefly 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 As I will show you next I will show 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.610
 then so for lack of time 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.480
 not then the 4 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480
 the 5 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 4 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030
 horse 7 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.250
 c 5 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.130
 d 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.130
 of 5 and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 65 x out of 5 then we capture cadillal 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.140
 this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.920
 this is how the step capture friends has 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.319
