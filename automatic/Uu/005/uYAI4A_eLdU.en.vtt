00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.380
 One of the top jewels in the dessert industry is the vanilla crystal shabu pastry. 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.720
 This biscuit is crispy and delicious. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.340
 The approach is simple 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.620
 Put flour 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
 While blowing up vanilla seeds 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.960
 Scratch like this 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.020
 Knife and cutting board parallel 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 Put in vanilla seeds 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.120
 Don't throw vanilla pods 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 Can be put into sugar 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 Soaked in sugar water, milk 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
 Dried food 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.740
 add sugar 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.000
 Hair powder 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 salt 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.640
 Put the cream into small pieces and put it in 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.700
 Directly put 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.000
 Just like making a crispy dough 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
 Is the same principle 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 Start with low speed 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 Put all the dried ingredients 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 Fresh cream, egg yolk liquid and finally put 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.940
 Sanding dough 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.300
 After the sanding is completed, liquid ingredients are added. 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.780
 Add egg yolk 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.700
 Maintain low speed 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.180
 Again, fresh cream 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 Full fat cream 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 Can make the dough stick 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 Dough bonding adds a smooth mouthfeel 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 There is also the aroma of shortbread 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.480
 stop 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420
 Never be too long 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580
 Dough oil is very smooth and very beautiful 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.200
 Then sprinkle the flour 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.820
 Sprinkle very little, just fine 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.500
 Too much flour will become too dry 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.120
 Not good 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.300
 Then come the growth bar 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.640
 This weight can be made two 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.200
 The dough is divided into two pieces 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660
 Pay attention to uniformity 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.280
 To be even 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.660
 No holes 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.180
 Otherwise, the cut surface is not beautiful. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 Also can't make the dough too solid 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.500
 a dough like a coin 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.440
 If not sure 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 Flatten the dough by hand and then fold it back 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.060
 Finished and then proceed to the second 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.500
 Put on the flat plate first 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.600
 Pour enough yellow sugar 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.740
 Put the dough and start rolling 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.200
 The dough does not need to be placed in the refrigerator 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.920
 Maintain softness 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.100
 Sugar is sticky 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.660
 No need to apply egg liquid 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.740
 Very simple 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.200
 Roll back and forth several times 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.100
 There will be a little thickness 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.720
 Feeling like a broken drill 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.420
 So called crystal diamond 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.340
 Placed on a small flat plate 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.080
 Put it in the refrigerator for 1 hour 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.260
 Take out the frozen strip of long crystal diamond vanilla dough 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.500
 Has hardened 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 Start cutting now 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.920
 Crystal diamond vanilla shortcake will collapse slightly when baked 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.360
 So you can't cut too much 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.240
 Cut the front end first 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.380
 Note that the thickness of each knife must be consistent 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900
 Just control the baking time 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 Knife 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.860
 If the blade is cold 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.280
 Place on the flat plate 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.900
 Interacting like a puff 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.360
 Then the dough is still cold and put in the oven. 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.480
 This is very important 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.360
 The temperature of the oven is 150 Â° C 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.220
 Bake for 15 to 20 minutes depending on oven performance 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.940
 Keep the surface a little white 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.260
 These crystal diamond cookies are very beautiful 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.700
 I should let it cool and eat, but we can't wait. 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.100
 This side of the granulated sugar 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
 Smooth and smooth, crispy and crispy 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.700
 Change now for you
