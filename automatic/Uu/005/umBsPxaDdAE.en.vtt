by far you know i like the fact that

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.960 
by far you know i like the fact that
read<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.740> react<00:01:07.009> seems<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.670> will<00:01:07.850> be

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
read and react seems that it will be

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.510 
read and react seems that it will be
focusing<00:01:08.479> on<00:01:08.659> eliminating<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.710> psychic<00:01:10.100> DBS

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
and also eliminating super linebackers

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.850 
and also eliminating super linebackers
and<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:14.689> know<00:01:14.780> things<00:01:14.960> of<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.290> nature<00:01:15.320> i

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
and you know things of that nature i

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.490 
and you know things of that nature i
also<00:01:16.220> like<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.850> passing<00:01:17.810> light<00:01:17.960> card<00:01:18.200> ID

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
also like the passing light card ID

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.860 
also like the passing light card ID
that's<00:01:18.860> that's<00:01:19.159> pretty<00:01:19.430> good<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.659> still

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's that's pretty good but it still

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.210 
that's that's pretty good but it still
remains<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.560> how<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.890> would<00:01:21.980> play<00:01:22.040> out

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
remains to see how that would play out

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.430 
remains to see how that would play out
you<00:01:22.970> know<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.300> you<00:01:23.360> throw<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.960> them<00:01:24.200> while

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
you know can you throw it to them while

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.490 
you know can you throw it to them while
the<00:01:25.010> icon<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:25.610> not<00:01:25.640> lit<00:01:26.060> but<00:01:26.870> what<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.350> to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the icon is not lit but what you have to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.350 
the icon is not lit but what you have to
always<00:01:27.650> wait<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.760> know<00:01:28.880> things<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.270> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
always wait you know things of that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.420 
always wait you know things of that
nature<00:01:29.390> will<00:01:29.840> still<00:01:30.050> be<00:01:30.530> up<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.920> air<00:01:30.950> I

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
nature will still be up in the air I

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.640 
nature will still be up in the air I
didn't<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.479> couple<00:01:32.960> things<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> still

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
didn't like a couple things and still

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.770 
didn't like a couple things and still
look<00:01:33.890> like<00:01:33.950> some<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.640> db's<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.630> know

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
look like some of the db's you know

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.170 
look like some of the db's you know
still<00:01:36.140> had<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.350> little<00:01:36.710> quick<00:01:36.890> speed<00:01:37.190> burst<00:01:37.430> and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
still had a little quick speed burst and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.770 
still had a little quick speed burst and
I<00:01:38.570> hope<00:01:39.080> they<00:01:39.799> can<00:01:40.010> tone<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.430> down<00:01:40.490> or<00:01:41.090> it

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
I hope they can tone that down or it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.690 
I hope they can tone that down or it
plays<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.320> lot<00:01:42.560> better<00:01:42.830> because<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.430> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
plays out a lot better because that that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.430 
plays out a lot better because that that
could<00:01:43.880> still<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.299> little<00:01:44.479> frustrating<00:01:44.750> even

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
could still be a little frustrating even

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.230 
could still be a little frustrating even
if<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:45.650> can't<00:01:45.979> see<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.340> ball<00:01:46.549> if<00:01:47.030> they're

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
if they can't see the ball if they're

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.940 
if they can't see the ball if they're
still<00:01:47.450> gonna<00:01:47.690> shift<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.260> ball<00:01:48.500> once<00:01:48.770> they

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
still gonna shift to the ball once they

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.580 
still gonna shift to the ball once they
see<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.340> then<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.000> still<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.390> not<00:01:50.420> organic<00:01:50.930> as

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
see it then that still is not organic as

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.490 
see it then that still is not organic as
