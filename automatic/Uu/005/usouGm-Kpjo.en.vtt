00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.230
 we refer to cable television as any signal transmission 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 television networks through a network of cables through which a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 set of services 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.490
 a cable television installation has a station the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.980
 receiver and another station 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 cable television also known as antenna television 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 community is born in the mountains of Pennsylvania at the end of the decade 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 the 40 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 It is not a technical innovation in itself but it uses pairs of inventions 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 already existing the antennas that allows to capture the electromagnetic signals 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 of television the piano 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.880
 and the coaxial cable used for the first time to send messages 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 submarine telegraph 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 at this time there were few television stations, parties only 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.180
 they broadcast from big cities like Philadelphia 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 obregon etcetera 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.630
 the scope of them was not very good and even more so taking into account the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.510
 orography that hindered the reception of the signal to people who lived 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 away from the cities causing general discontent 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.120
 because of this and due to the commercial interests of important manufacturers 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.500
 of televisions as well as the good economic recovery that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.620
 experienced the united states took place the progress records 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.080
 in the field of telecommunications this brought with it the rapid 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.880
 cable expansion 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.020
 On the other hand, there is a theory that cable principles are found in 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.930
 the United Kingdom a few years before World War II where certain 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.340
 companies installed community antennas to receive the first signs of the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.340
 bbc 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.689
 the coaxial cable was improving over the years this is built with 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.959
 materials that facilitated the transmission and also counted as 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.859
 amplifiers to increase strength

 with the scholarship 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.199
 of the 70 and they begin to be resolved until December 1995 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 when the telecommunications law was passed 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:56.119
 in 1972 adolfo suÃ¡rez and the telephone president signed an agreement to 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.179

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.930

 According to the agreement, it was planned to begin issuing annual tests 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.730
 following but due to the technical difficulties and the political moment that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 I was going through Spain 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.549

 the oldest cable system in Spain from which documentation exists 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.079

 the general telecommunications law of 2003 repeals the 1995

 Cable market in Spain 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:45.279
 There are currently four main operators that spread throughout

 the cable has traditionally been a way of distributing images in
