00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.850
 it wasn't suffering blown yesterday 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.290
 for these people 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.880
 they probably had the best 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.040
 found way to free Saturday 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.140
 spend for the runners on it 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.860
 course was hardly sheltered from 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.860
 the burning sun 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.560
 michel de maat the local favorite 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.450
 told about running a marathon 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 in that heat 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.520
 which is ax and just from half 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 it 's so sure when you're too hard 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 starts 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.980
 then make yourself an awful lot 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 energy and you get it from outside as well 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 some extra warmth then yes then then 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.970
 it is just a misery to drink something 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.410
 you enough also yes you do enough 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.050
 cooling from outside 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.630
 with sponge what then get it hot 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 Dangers are then mainly dehydration 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 and overheating 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 your body temperature can reach 40 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.220
 walk degrees or even over it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.960
 yes that just means that you have one 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.370
 severe and flu then it comes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 basically down 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 and besides that overheating 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.410
 lose a lot of moisture that is possible 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.610
 also 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.800
 being four four five just means yes 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.320
 that the body is in a crisis situation 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.270
 wrong 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.010
 about 200 men ventured into that 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.770
 company yesterday including one 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.630
 fifteen athletes from the grass what 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.340
 suffering and that you are increasingly talking about europe 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.420
 looks out wandering in search of what 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 especially in the leading group 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.950
 john vermeulen as haas the belgian will 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 extensive aided by compatriots fires 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.009

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.229
 The Algerian Mohammed will be the winner and week 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.180

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.690
 span services 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.759
 After a kilometer or 5 field is already 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.920
 completely disguised 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.840

 Dutchman Jan van Rijthoven and Michel 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.090

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.390

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 vermeulen may not go to the olympic 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.519
 play has not reached the limit and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.570
 makes another possible attempt in June 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.570
 on the 10 km 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.600
 michel de maas englishman jump off 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.620
 row courts 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.000
 hendriks the belgian and not poll running 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.590
 and not for each ascii 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.380
 Van Rijthoven also ran in Rotterdam 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.360
 pretty well recovered from that marathon 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.970
 decided to participate in this one too 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.500
 very difficult undertaking it turned 28 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.900
 degrees in the Westland yesterday 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.880
 the degree of driving courts already announced 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.880
 going away at a pace that is more in the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 was close to 216 217 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.390
 will go more so its quick start later 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.970
 we buy it is a man you are familiar with 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.800
 of the 1990 marathon he won it then and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.570
 made furore by not at all 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.040
 drink during in marathon 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.840
 that mate to be with him during the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.940
 Ramadan 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.940
 in a day of fasting should be 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.489
 after three quarters eh salmi and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.810
 vermeulen still far ahead and the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.430
 two following groups 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.629
 closer together 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.129
 but guilt has now been let off 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.150
 bags and second group 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.909
 and it is so good with van rijthoven 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.680
 indeed, 45 minutes have been walked 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.000
 and all problem for the runners 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.439
 still to come 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 the month told what you are up against 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.970
 can do overheating 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.970
 do minimal clothing already 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.900
 you can't tell i'm going to that shadow 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.280
 lopik its the wind that goes 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.020
 not all you can do 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.180
 is as much as possible cool from the outside 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.700
 Beverages understood the organization too 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.810
 has placed a cushion at installations 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.250
 on the trail 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.560
 and it is also a matter of 10 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.690
 response that gets to address and 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.459
 actually think it is important too 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.739
 and what is actually allowed 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.540
 but that you have such a feature from people 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.040
 along the side offering in sponge that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.290
 you need to address ten chrome 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.480
 because yes it is it is actually outside 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.340
 the rules but certainly when the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.720
 organization is not dropping enough 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 important to anyway 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.690
 yes for your own safety everything 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.690
 to deal with 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.760
 at about 22 km salmi was walked in under 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.340
 others through this man to the majority of yuri 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:24.100
 pavle or 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.100
 h3 heart field drags him past salmi 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.490
 Paul followed in the footsteps of these two 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.050
 chef ski 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.389
 that first I think wo n't stay away 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.840
 but then turn on and reconnect with 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.840
 flop 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.710
 that will now look at where the rest remains 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.450
 what am i going to do i go with these men 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.510
 or did I take my bags 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.610
 walking alone was not clear 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.670
 here though that will pay more toll for it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.680
 start his jokes he comes a while 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.600
 walking alone and will later pass 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.790
 be sought by, among others, the 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.890
 degree of driving courts 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.110
 we are barry cesky on the right in image one 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.610
 of course they also get extra 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.490
 water the offered not only the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.220
 Dutch people are helped here 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.170
 ridge ascii has been seen in it before 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.600
 westland he finished third last year 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.130
 and now makes a shot at the first 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.010
 Place 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.200
 michel the measure now also won't pass 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.890
 more runs behind it than jan van 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.730
 row courts 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.530
 pavle or is now already a way and 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.630
 runs fast on reach ascii already takes 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.980
 a fast lead of around 50 meters 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.330
 to 80 and the difficult phase of the 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.820
 competition is still to come 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.100
 are here at about a kilometer or 233 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.380
 and the competition is not yet decided 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.720
 bridge jet ski runs a 200 meter here 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.470
 behind him the size is still reasonable 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.470
 nearby 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.600
 so no shelter at all for the 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:58.100
 sun here no wind no cooling 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.100
 therefore the most difficult phase of the competition 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.650
 is a moment when michele maat 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.630
 was actually catching up 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.850
 reed jf schedule he is bothered by the 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.850
 spleen and abdominal cramps had to be on too 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.070
 just stop a bit went over and over 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.990
 had to let the poll or go Pavle 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.449
 that was already clear by now 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.160
 so far before that was no longer to catch 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.370
 he is a policeman from the neighborhood 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.320
 from the Caspian Sea and is here on one 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.010
 exchange with the Dutch police 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:33.180
 men are known marathon runner 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.910
 became 24th in london bridge ascii this year 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.530
 test yet bold attempts at something 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.630
 but it got closer to pavel 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.639
 wouldn't work anymore 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.710
 here former coach of the quay u 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:47.010
 wim interrogations still employed by 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:50.100
 michel the last one or as the winner 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:53.190
 go to the line the time was not 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.080
 important within 2 hours of 1970 phenomena 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.479
 was important and important for 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.860
 this trial was that 10,000 guilders 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:04.570
 won and capital in god 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.400
 my three cesky even find second 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:11.229
 above 22 and then third comes michel 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.440
 the measure inside while there from sloffie 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.150
 if I was not sick it already becomes the 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.160
 Matra third and despite a price of 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.990
 7000 guilders attracted the same sense of being 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.030
 company is also in doubt 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.550
 our call was the question in the shore you 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.530
 think in the desire for water 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.810
 it collectors tried concentration 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.330
 keep calling constant calls 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.180
 my arms are not focused 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.800
 my back does not get hot when it is dry 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.620
 I don't have to cool down causing me water 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.620
 get away that is continuously 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.620
 I am the first five in the picture 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.750
 almost all of them ended in half 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.919
 minute from the mesh and sammy with then 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.919
 finally only and the sixth 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 Well
