00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.149 
do kind of tricks and so be just using a
kind<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.760> more<00:02:02.240> creative<00:02:02.690> way<00:02:02.840> than<00:02:03.290> you

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
kind of a more creative way than you

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.380 
kind of a more creative way than you
know<00:02:04.250> having<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.550> wall<00:02:04.700> stopping<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.270> from

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
know having a wall stopping you from

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.149 
know having a wall stopping you from
getting<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.930> next<00:02:06.110> place<00:02:06.380> or<00:02:06.590> stairs<00:02:06.980> to

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
getting to the next place or stairs to

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.490 
getting to the next place or stairs to
walk<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.880> can<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:09.019> a<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.289> cool

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
walk up so you can it's a really cool

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.040 
walk up so you can it's a really cool
way<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:10.369> kind<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.670> or<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.390> find<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.959> really

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
way to to kind of or I find that really

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
way to to kind of or I find that really
cool<00:02:12.200> way<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.410> look<00:02:12.650> at<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.830> city<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.400> know

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
cool way to look at a city you know

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
cool way to look at a city you know
and<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.940> giant<00:02:15.240> playground

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and as like a kind of giant playground

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.640 
and as like a kind of giant playground
and<00:02:16.160> when<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.460> stuff<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.760> did<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and when the kind of stuff I did in the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
and when the kind of stuff I did in the
inspired<00:02:20.550> video<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:20.970> was<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.540> right

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
inspired video was was just like right

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.820 
inspired video was was just like right
along<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.470> spiky<00:02:22.860> fence<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:25.710> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
along this off of a spiky fence and in a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.010 
along this off of a spiky fence and in a
while<00:02:25.980> she<00:02:26.220> had<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.360> tree<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.810> things

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
while she had right up a tree and things

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.280 
while she had right up a tree and things
lat<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.250> flip<00:02:29.580> off<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.850> tree<00:02:30.170> that's<00:02:31.170> the

out to most people that yeah I mean as
it's<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.850> stuff<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.270> I've<00:02:36.360> been<00:02:36.390> doing

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's kind of stuff that I've been doing

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.590 
it's kind of stuff that I've been doing
I've<00:02:37.140> been<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.740> long<00:02:37.920> time<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:39.180> was

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
I've been in for a long time and I was

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600 
I've been in for a long time and I was
very<00:02:39.690> lucky<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.200> put<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
very lucky that we put it down and I you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.199 
very lucky that we put it down and I you
know<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> had<00:02:41.820> my<00:02:41.850> friend<00:02:42.120> sob<00:02:42.720> filming<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
know I had my friend sob filming it and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.000 
know I had my friend sob filming it and
making<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.390> into<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.720> video<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.260> can

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
making it into the video that can

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
making it into the video that can
eventually<00:02:47.310> we've<00:02:47.580> got<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.060> know<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.720> into

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
eventually we've got you know got into

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.530 
eventually we've got you know got into
it<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.260> today's<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.459> way<00:02:50.580> back<00:02:50.760> home<00:02:51.000> was

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
it as today's the way back home was

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.229 
it as today's the way back home was
quite<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> lot<00:02:52.320> harder<00:02:52.500> because<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:53.250> had<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> much

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
quite a lot harder because I had a much

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.420 
quite a lot harder because I had a much
wider<00:02:54.989> idea<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.620> looking<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.100> know<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.310> had

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
wider idea to be looking you know I had

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.729 
wider idea to be looking you know I had
some<00:02:56.670> things<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> mind<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.450> Scotland<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
some things in mind and Scotland but I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.979 
some things in mind and Scotland but I
mean<00:02:59.489> some<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.760> which<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> never<00:03:00.540> imagined

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
mean some of which that I never imagined

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.660 
mean some of which that I never imagined
myself<00:03:01.140> doing<00:03:01.350> like<00:03:01.770> they<00:03:01.950> had<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> castle

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
myself doing like they had in the castle

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.670 
myself doing like they had in the castle
you<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.060> never<00:03:03.690> thought<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.470> million

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you know I never thought in a million

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.500 
you know I never thought in a million
years<00:03:04.950> I'd<00:03:05.100> be<00:03:05.130> writing<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.000> let<00:03:06.390> alone

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
years I'd be writing on that let alone

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.420 
years I'd be writing on that let alone
trying<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.260> trick<00:03:07.440> I'd<00:03:07.890> never<00:03:08.100> done<00:03:08.340> in

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
trying to do a trick I'd never done in

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.560 
trying to do a trick I'd never done in
that<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.670> well<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.380> hard<00:03:10.650> work<00:03:10.920> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that as well it really was hard work and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.670 
that as well it really was hard work and
because<00:03:12.570> writing<00:03:12.750> streets<00:03:13.080> quite<00:03:13.320> simple

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
because writing streets quite simple

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.949 
because writing streets quite simple
because<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:13.980> concrete<00:03:14.190> run-ups<00:03:14.959> concrete

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
because it's concrete run-ups concrete

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.440 
because it's concrete run-ups concrete
landings<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:18.060> kind<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.299> thing

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
landings you know and that kind of thing

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.870 
landings you know and that kind of thing
but<00:03:18.660> China<00:03:19.019> raids<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:20.130> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> turn<00:03:20.640> up<00:03:20.760> on
