00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi to all the boys here and civil and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 Here we are back with the second episode 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 of climbing in this episode we will go 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 to make the first game or the quarters 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.280
 bronze tournament finals will be the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 first game with new purchases 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.250
 boniperti and large piscitella bone 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.960
 we had already taken it but it was already a result 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 fundamental in a game as you can 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 see after these players yes 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.699
 will find it truly fundamental to the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 my team 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.279
 here in fact I go under 1 to 0 but then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 with boniperti a little to luck I can to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 find the draw number 10 of the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.149
 team that finds its first goal lasts 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.680
 very little later but it also succeeds to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 put the second goal and then a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 take advantage of the next kim ve lo 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.300
 I really recommend for turners 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 fast and to be a bronze also a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.559
 good shot will almost never go wrong 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 will eat door so it's really good 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.780
 in the meantime, it also shows itself 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 gandolfo who finds his first goal with 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.690
 the former team shirt that goes on 3 a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 1 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.439
 subsequently a good deed of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.920
 but grandolfo that goes on is spread out 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 from the goalkeeper then penalty kick 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.210
 after a bit of indecision about who he would have 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.680
 beaten the penalty will go from the penalty spot 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.619
 boniperti number 10 of the team that yes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.750
 prepare boniperti boniperti puts it 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.060
 in then 4 to 1 for the next in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.909
 now unfortunately you know I don't have one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.310
 good goalkeeper very good defense here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.659
 there is also some commitment 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.150
 in fact in this episode 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.860
 I will also change porter because that one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960
 ball 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
 blocked what you do should not be rejected 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.330
 here a great action starts 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.580
 personal of those big that he scores 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.950
 the final goal then first game that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.270
 closes with the score and boys of 5 a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.550
 2 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.610
 beware however grandolfo grandolfo 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.290
 grandolfo grandolfo grandolfo without 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.990
 wife who puts it in and joked 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.760
 boy indeed the game will end if a2 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.650
 I'm sorry I didn't want to do this course 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.450
 is that it is a bit ugly because I stole the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.490
 ball to the goalkeeper as he put it back though 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.870
 then try to fly even 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.920
 put it in and finally came 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.200
 off an own goal 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.290
 now the new purchases will start 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.010
 midfielders too, these are not there 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.230
 I knew they are black and the last not 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.930
 I remember it, however, because it's something else 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.560
 about getting them fast enough 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.530
 and here, however, also with the concierge 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.540
 Italian bronze now to put like 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.340
 you will see 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.830
 the agreement to do quite a bit now here we are 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.160
 what made me more angry 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.470
 semifinal and I get stuck so guys and 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 gave me the game lost this is a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.690
 problem that often happens with mine 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.239
 connection 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.560
 I felt terrible because I could 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.720
 also beat a team like this 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 mostly semi-final heroin of the tournament 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.410
 bronze and would have been important 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.200
 win it so I'm very sorry 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 anyway I'll have to start is 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.489
 it also adapts defeat so for one 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080
 situation of 2 wins 2 defeats 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.910
 this is the last game of the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.660
 pisodio we'll see right away 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.760
 piscitella tile piscitella la 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.549
 riveted and grandolfo puts it inside 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 really how you see this 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.680
 buying up front is really a lot 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.950
 useful and then now also brought by a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.140
 good midfield 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.359
 they will prove even more so 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.459
 effective in the next episode I wanted 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.299
 to anticipate you did not ask me in 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.219
 comments 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.769
 I will go to make the first matches of the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.450
 season even if you meet teams 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.180
 much stronger than me 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.409
 precisely and therefore with some also 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.909
 gold player 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.400
 I already have some ideas in mind but I don't 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.430
 I advance nothing because otherwise I spoil the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.220
 beautiful here in the meantime another account arrives 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.859
 it is now no longer a new major purchase 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.109
 this is also a pretty good match 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.090
 dominated as you see between the teams 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.049
 bronze even though I have no dari players e 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.220
 various things 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:06.280
 I 'm sorry I can win 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.959
 quite often 15 these players 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.730
 Italians are pretty strong 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.530
 especially humans are very fast not 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.500
 I thought they were made at the beginning 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.099
 I wanted to do an English team though 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.660
 then off 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.079
 I am Italian so it better speaks 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.940
 Italian here in the meantime I had scored a goal 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.990
 because I am very surprised and above all 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.580
 in defense the goalkeeper sleeps and arrives 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.300
 the first goal also of the new 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.970
 midfielder three striker midfielder 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.159
 these were Moorish and Gallic people I repeat 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.080
 because if any of you also to 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.550
 find start want to take these 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.270
 players for the board really 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.070
 a lot because they are very strong 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.389
 meanwhile obviously launch the goal 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.250
 identical to the one before I really am 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.349
 a blowjob in defense then spending 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.020
 especially in these days of bronze 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.770
 I really suck in defense 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.220
 things happen anyway luckily 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.199
 i'm not generates i was taking 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.840
 also quite quietly because 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.490
 I was in the lead anyway I felt that the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.710
 we were playing against it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.740
 meanwhile he also had a nice goal from the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.539
 distance of the Moro midfielder then 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.520
 in this we have in this game 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.370
 also seen immediately in action of 200 are 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.430
 ancient new that they have just put to 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.740
 sign two goals so you will see precisely 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.330
 also how useful they turn out to be 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.250
 in the first games he had to do 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.810
 reliance almost exclusively on attackers 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.759
 because midfielders were enough 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.340
 poor here comes the goal of the first the 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.919
 first Italian player I have 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.830
 bought for the rose or piscitella e 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.009
 so game on 5 to 2 but continues 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.669
 the goleada of the former team here 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:51.610
 a bit lopsided boniperti again 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.240
 boniperti does it all by itself and then the shot 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.940
 at the left corner boniperti enjoys the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.620
 6 to 2 really one -way game though 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.080
 we count that its two goals are more or less 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.400
 I've made them work here 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.090
 ball arrives money still drink him 7 a 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.270
 2 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.139
 really devastation from the former 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.610
 team 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.150
 but it is not over here in fact it also arrives 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.210
 the last grandolfo cross goal for 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.509
 piscitella and piscitella also finds a 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.580
 no other goal here for this guys 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.460
 episode is everything I recommend because 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.319
 if you want to see other episodes of the 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.289
 climb you have to put I like I would say 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.389
 that as soon as we arrive at 30 I like it 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.909
 then the next episode will come 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.310
 the sooner we arrive the sooner the new arrives 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.590
 episode I recommend then if you want 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.210
 that you will come soon to put it there 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.610
 start to say goodbye 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.940
 you are already informed that in the next 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.340
 episode and we're also going to do the 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.169
 seasons then something will come out of 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.720
 even more epic, however, I cannot tell you 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.599
 nothing but I've already done it and it comes out 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.220
 an epic thing so cv is everything 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.650
 see you guys at the next episode 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.650
 I recommend 30 I like hello guys
