00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.290
 how will this month the god be with new 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.019
 slugs my figures below ctera 3 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.150
 then well let's start then 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.360
 let's start with the most the most 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.340
 simple then this is an evil 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm not sure if it's a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.400
 electroshock but I think if I'm not 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.580
 very safe but she is evil and she 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.170
 call job jack 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.660
 good 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.200
 this one is so gless that it's a mucus slug 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200
 I think 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.510
 dv 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 this is a tornado slug is bluster 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.070
 this is a bubble using 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.070
 it's called suit 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.119
 this is an enigma slug is called mold 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.909
 and it 's supposedly I think special 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.680
 because it was supposedly the only one 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 it was the only one under load but 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 there really was not really another one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.850
 I do not remember much about that anymore because 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 I almost do not see it but good 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 these three if I do not remember very well 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 will want saiz this is called muki and I think 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.340
 which is one that throws thorns 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.930
 I do not remember very well I think so 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.860
 Y 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.860
 because 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.690
 good 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.930
 this is called 1st 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.290
 and then it's a special thing too and 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 I think it's a mermaid slug 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.840
 agreement very well no lie no no no 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.580
 I would not forgive me for that as 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.480
 we were 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.300
 and this that last is 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.330
 the fla 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.060
 larynx 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.770
 and I think it's also a kind of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.420
 fire slug but it is not 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.970
