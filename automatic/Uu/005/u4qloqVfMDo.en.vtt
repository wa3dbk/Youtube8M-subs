are after breaking them in I had about
three<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.640> four<00:02:46.790> half-hour<00:02:47.540> sessions<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.380> an

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
surge during the day they lost me like

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:11.920 
surge during the day they lost me like
about<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> week<00:02:55.670> s<00:02:56.380> um<00:02:57.380> cheers

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:26.559 

some<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.140> head

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.240 

is<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> small<00:03:28.080> difference<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.680> ATA<00:03:28.980> and

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
is it a small difference in the ATA and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.699 
is it a small difference in the ATA and
the<00:03:29.340> ADA<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.750> bribed<00:03:31.020> both<00:03:31.200> sets<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the ADA to a the I bribed both sets and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.920 
the ADA to a the I bribed both sets and
the<00:03:31.800> ATA<00:03:32.069> they're<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.370> bit<00:03:32.550> um<00:03:32.780> they<00:03:33.780> don't

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the ATA they're a bit um they don't

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.960 
the ATA they're a bit um they don't
really<00:03:34.050> slow<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.440> down<00:03:34.770> any<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.730> than<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
really slow you down any more than the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.309 
really slow you down any more than the
82<00:03:36.450> s<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.810> they<00:03:37.800> say<00:03:38.069> more<00:03:38.490> they<00:03:38.940> sort<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.319> to

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
82 s but they say more they sort of to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.400 
82 s but they say more they sort of to
me<00:03:40.440> but<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.739> still<00:03:41.239> slide<00:03:42.239> quite<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> lot<00:03:42.870> don't

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
me but I still slide quite a lot don't

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.920 
me but I still slide quite a lot don't
slow<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.739> down<00:03:43.920> or<00:03:43.980> too<00:03:44.250> much<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:45.300> I'm<00:03:45.510> they

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
slow you down or too much and I'm they

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.540 
slow you down or too much and I'm they
definitely<00:03:46.260> died<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> whole<00:03:46.980> lot<00:03:47.160> quicker<00:03:47.400> than

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
definitely died a whole lot quicker than

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.160 
definitely died a whole lot quicker than
the<00:03:47.670> 82<00:03:48.060> s<00:03:48.860> peers<00:03:49.860> are<00:03:50.069> probably<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:51.020> 52<00:03:52.020> or

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the 82 s peers are probably about 52 or

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.770 
the 82 s peers are probably about 52 or
53<00:03:52.470> ml<00:03:52.830> now<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.190> I've<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.400> like<00:03:53.580> five<00:03:54.420> runs

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
53 ml now and I've got like five runs

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.930 
53 ml now and I've got like five runs
and<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.020> couple<00:03:55.230> paychecks<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.010> they're<00:03:56.790> about

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
and a couple paychecks and they're about

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.820 
and a couple paychecks and they're about
49<00:03:59.940> or<00:04:00.150> something<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.019> just<00:04:01.200> shows<00:04:01.350> how<00:04:01.380> fast

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
49 or something so just shows how fast

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.860 
49 or something so just shows how fast
they<00:04:01.950> do<00:04:02.010> where<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.970> 82<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> is<00:04:03.450> not<00:04:03.630> quite<00:04:03.810> as

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
they do where the 82 a is not quite as

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.100 
they do where the 82 a is not quite as
fast<00:04:04.140> but<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.190> they<00:04:05.400> still<00:04:05.580> go<00:04:05.760> now<00:04:06.750> um

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
fast but you know they still go now um

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.250 
fast but you know they still go now um
so<00:04:07.590> basically<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.660> noticed<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.080> these

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
so basically I just noticed that these

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.979 
so basically I just noticed that these
wheels<00:04:10.500> are<00:04:10.650> kind<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.010> starting<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.900> chunk<00:04:12.900> a

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
wheels are kind of starting to chunk a

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.320 
wheels are kind of starting to chunk a
bit<00:04:13.170> hasn't<00:04:13.920> really<00:04:14.069> come<00:04:14.220> off<00:04:14.400> yet<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.030> can

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
bit hasn't really come off yet but I can

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.289 
bit hasn't really come off yet but I can
imagine<00:04:16.160> soon<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.239> pretty

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
imagine soon it's going to get pretty

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.820 
imagine soon it's going to get pretty
bad<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:20.760> really<00:04:20.910> affecting<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
bad it's not really affecting the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.950 
bad it's not really affecting the
consistency<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:23.389> anything<00:04:24.389> it's<00:04:24.510> not<00:04:24.660> overly

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
consistency or anything it's not overly

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.770 
consistency or anything it's not overly
and<00:04:25.260> yet<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.550> pretty<00:04:26.790> good<00:04:27.060> i'm<00:04:27.210> happy

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and yet so that's pretty good i'm happy

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.570 
and yet so that's pretty good i'm happy
about<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:28.110> i'm<00:04:28.919> going<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.100> be<00:04:29.190> testing<00:04:29.490> out

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
about that i'm going to be testing out

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.630 
about that i'm going to be testing out
dad's<00:04:30.240> old<00:04:30.570> these<00:04:31.020> ATF's<00:04:31.710> never<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.490> them

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
dad's old these ATF's never in them

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.390 
dad's old these ATF's never in them
before<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.300> see<00:04:34.140> how<00:04:34.229> they<00:04:34.380> go<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.800> some<00:04:34.979> real

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
before so see how they go on some real

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.050 
before so see how they go on some real
icy<00:04:35.760> pavements

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:05:12.230 

Oh

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.340 

even<00:05:13.240> though<00:05:13.360> these<00:05:13.479> wheels<00:05:13.750> are<00:05:14.080> really

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
even though these wheels are really

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.310 
even though these wheels are really
small<00:05:14.729> maybe<00:05:15.729> run<00:05:16.060> run<00:05:16.270> away<00:05:16.479> from<00:05:16.540> coring

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
small maybe run run away from coring

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.129 
small maybe run run away from coring
they<00:05:18.280> are<00:05:18.520> predictable<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.570> not<00:05:19.780> as

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
they are predictable but not as

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.540 
they are predictable but not as
predictable<00:05:20.500> as<00:05:20.770> when<00:05:21.400> they<00:05:21.520> are<00:05:21.580> large<00:05:23.550> as

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
predictable as when they are large as

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.430 
predictable as when they are large as
these<00:05:24.760> wheels<00:05:25.000> get<00:05:25.210> smaller<00:05:25.540> they<00:05:26.199> leave<00:05:26.410> a

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
these wheels get smaller they leave a

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.330 
these wheels get smaller they leave a
lot<00:05:26.800> more<00:05:26.949> pain<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:28.120> die<00:05:28.389> a<00:05:28.419> lot<00:05:28.690> more<00:05:28.840> quickly

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
lot more pain but die a lot more quickly

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.550 
lot more pain but die a lot more quickly
bring<00:05:30.340> how<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.970> see<00:05:31.360> dis<00:05:31.570> pavement<00:05:32.050> is<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:32.440> how

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
bring how I see dis pavement is and how

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.610 
bring how I see dis pavement is and how
small<00:05:32.830> these<00:05:33.100> wheels<00:05:33.310> getting<00:05:33.610> there<00:05:34.360> are<00:05:34.620> the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
small these wheels getting there are the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.770 
small these wheels getting there are the
handling<00:05:36.100> it<00:05:36.190> very<00:05:36.220> well<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.880> as<00:05:37.300> they<00:05:37.510> do<00:05:37.570> get

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
handling it very well and as they do get

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.939 
handling it very well and as they do get
smaller<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.229> get<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.410> little<00:05:38.590> bit<00:05:38.830> on

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
smaller to get a little bit on

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.830 
smaller to get a little bit on
predictable<00:05:39.910> but<00:05:40.539> it's<00:05:40.720> definitely

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
predictable but it's definitely

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.110 
predictable but it's definitely
something<00:05:41.169> that<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.380> can<00:05:41.530> handle<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.190> on<00:05:42.910> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
something that you can handle and on a

something that you can handle and on a
slide<00:05:43.419> sort<00:05:43.690> of<00:05:43.780> more<00:05:43.930> on<00:05:44.080> top<00:05:44.260> of<00:05:44.320> the
