 without continuing its global strategy of offering innovative products 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.169
 to an increasingly diverse clientele 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.599
 the person launches his newest vehicle the crossover 3008 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.170
 start seeing that it meets the characteristics of 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.490
 are of the ego and sport utility the brand starts to dispute a new segment 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.489
 market 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.640
 The first infarct is naturally its visual in which you notice the style 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.800
 Own developed by pj 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.140
 with sharp headlights start facing the v in exclusive madrid and reinforces the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.540
 adventurous character of the modern 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.830
 on the side- 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the rear the bulbs nabor pubis equipped with hated of the electrodes measures 7 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 ensures even more modernity to the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 to change 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 with the stumbling block the 3008 note the advanced windshield with the position of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 driving higher yes generous internal space 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 the innovative concept of the vehicle is reflected in systems such as realities 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 that use a retractable polycarbonate 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.450
 driver's field of vision to project key information 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.460
 referring to driving 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 is also associated with the alert dispense that controls the car's distance 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 obstacle ahead 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.800
 the vehicle was perfect for those who seek practicality in the transportation of 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.930
 luggage 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.700
 your trunk can be divided into three levels an exclusivity 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.960
 patented by the person 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.570
 to access it the evidence has two independent parts 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.740
 with a superior 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 and another lower 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 which helps a lot when loading heavier objects 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.199
 with a normal capacity of 512 liters 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.909
 can hold up to 1604 liters of luggage with the folded rear seats 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.599
 the 3 thousand and eight weight is distinguished by its great ergonomic position display 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.949
 even in a higher vehicle and to ensure better operation of the 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.869
 mechanical assembly and its connections with the soil with a good 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:36.299
 acoustic all to ensure maximum pleasure when driving 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.419
 from 2011 the model will be the first of the group psa peugeot-citroen a 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.249
 combining the combustion engine over the hood that pulls forward loose and the 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.299
 installed on the floor of the trunk who draw the wheels 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.519
 rear 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.340
 very strong radius technology will bring a 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.610
 fuel consumption and low CO2 emissions, but also 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.109
 will revolutionize how to avoid a car with full wheel drive 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:14.579
 3008 there is no mechanical connection between the press and 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.779
 car fractionation is all managed electronically by the system 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:32.159
 the 3008 also reveals swathion to face land 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.239
 vehicles originally proposed reimbursement 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.489
 optional in the model range the film counted distributes electronically the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.319
 force on the front wheels to ensure the best performance of the car 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.879
 depending on the level of track adhesion 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.910
 being that the difference of traction in the wheels for example 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.050
 can reach up to 100% the number well above the limits of a differential of 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.169
 limited slip to complete the set 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:03.519
 the 3008 uses 16-inch wheels meant mendes no drama on average 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 in Portuguese 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.469
 stands out it has not played well as a range of modern engines 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.829
 economic 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.249
 and respect the environment 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:24.740
 the 3008 will offer four versions to say of a comma six and two liters 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.990
 plus two gas-powered 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.710
 the 1 point 6 versions use five and six manual transmission 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.039
 speeds 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.330
 while the 2-liter engines have the option of automatic transmission 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.690
 also six-speed
