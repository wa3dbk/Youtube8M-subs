00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello such friends Punte how is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.730
 I am the bug trainer this time 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.589
 let's talk about the importance of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:16.470
 proteins for the recovery of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:18.240
 muscle so I know that this video the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 Friends of Ponte well protein is a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.010
 amino acid complex that helps us to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.109
 keep life in general is a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
 necessary food that gives us 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 nitrogen unlike other groups 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.880
 foods such as carbohydrates 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.500
 and fats and we can find it in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 food sources as they are fish 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.590
 milk egg any kind of food 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 of animal origin contains contains 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 proteins like some that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.820
 some plants for example soy alone 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.430
 that is not a complete protein put 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 that an amino acid is missing but the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 we can also find in some 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.960
 seeds like nuts are 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.160
 peanuts 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.559
 and we can even find it in 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 junk foods but then in little 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.300
 amount then we need to bring you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 to our minimum body 2 grams of 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.360
 protein per day per kilo of body to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.390
 keep the muscle in an optimal state 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.979
 anabolic is sometimes difficult to cover with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.350
 this energy requirement of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.640
 proteins despite the fact that your diet 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.440
 Adds fish chicken vegetables milk 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.179
 even by the schedules sometimes it's 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.740
 complicated to comply with the meals that 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.539
 we need for that there are 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.550
 food supplements that can help us 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.679
 help provide the protein to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.869
 our body and especially to the 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.940
 athletes that we need more 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.429
 Protein requirement due to wear 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.890
 that we suffer the proteins they sell 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.720
 as food supplements because we 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.119
 provide enough for 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.820
 after a workout we can 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.649
 add even to the malted saying that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.050
 in other programs we have already 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.270
 talked about and that they can serve us for 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.770
 maintain muscle mass and thus have the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.479
 body that we want 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.229
 the proteins come in different 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.570
 presentations is a powder and there are three 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.149
 types of proteins one is whey 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.550
 side 3 calcium caseinate and the other is 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.190
 egg albumin whey is 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.989
 the highest-value protein 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.140
 biological since it contains all the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.060
 amino acids and the bioavailability that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.610
 has our body to assimilate it is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.250
 the best is the fastest and most of all 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.019
 which is what makes us replenish the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.849
 muscle after a workout in 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.620
 second place would be the protein the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.110
 Innate case of calcium is a derivative 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.239
 also of milk but with a process 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.880
 a little harder of our body 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.910
 to assimilate it and therefore it is good 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.000
 consume it between meals that is moments 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.950
 conducive to a drop in energy and the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.049
 egg albumin that is contained in 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 the egg and that does not give us also 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.400
 all the essential amino acids but 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.170
 essential to cover the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.110
 requirements that the muscle needs 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.599
 both in a training and in the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.090
 everyday life we ​​must take it to the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.590
 less twice a day than it is in the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 tomorrow for 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.849
 the fast that comes from the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.670
 word breakfast and after the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.819
 training to replenish the muscles 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.610
 I repeat this is to have a life 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.769
 Healthy is also not only for 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.930
 the people who exercise but in 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.870
 general is a food that is going to 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.060
 help to have a healthier life 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.910
 be in better physical condition and on 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.209
 all have a stability both at the level 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.530
 emotional psychic and corporal 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.970
 good friends, this was the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.310
 program of the importance of 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 proteins remember that you should not 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.269
 neglect the workouts and now that 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.980
 you already know the importance of 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.079
 proteins so you can add it to the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.120
 malted said remember to share my 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.069
 videos because it's not possible we're in 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.410
 first place in obesity we have to 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.769
 fight this write me on facebook 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.910
 to know your doubts to know you 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.010
 send me your photos to know your 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.349
 evolution how they have been serving you 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.190
 the videos share them please I am 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.130
 the bug trainer and remember to get well 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.730
 in the lesson 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.730
 Y 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.380
 yes 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.370
 if you want
