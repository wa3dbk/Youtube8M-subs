00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.849
 Welcome, people. Welcome to the channel. 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.199
 just the way it is 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.880
 this video will bring you the 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.950
 main releases of the films and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.930
 some news and news as well 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.430
 It's really cool news there, by the way. 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.949
 Let's start the video talking about x-men 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.750
 on the future forgotten after 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.340
 disclosure of the trailer arrived at the turn of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.469
 check the new poster 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.540
 he sees the whimsical gathering the 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.820
 main characters of the film 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.700
 film this picture you can not even 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 check the fan page on the channel on the 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.480
 facebook, it's really cool, and I hope 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.219
 that you go there while the page that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.989
 has plenty of content and is quite 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.699
 interactive too 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.530
 Good, now, let's go to a good news. 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.420
 boring that I particularly did not like 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.640
 but the object does not say that its 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.769
 wolverine replacement is inevitable 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.789
 for that certainly wolverine fans 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.589
 do not wait 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.290
 but the actor returned to the subject 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.540
 during the filming of x-men days of a 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.940
 future forgotten one that jackson told 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.040
 to the gnr site that already has its 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.450
 Replacement looks this is inevitable 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.370
 he said 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.740
 Who do you think is essential in this business? 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.130
 is deceiving himself said the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.890
 interpreter of the hero for 14 years in seven 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.050
 movies with mutants and now that you 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.390
 you think you could be the future holder 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.580
 of the powerful adamantium claws 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.550
 every time he walked on the set with the claws 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 and a hairstyle, thank you for my luck 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.220
 jetman in an allusion to the fact that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.620
 your partner have been replaced by 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 younger actors in ex my first 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.810
 class and he did not stay in the movie 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.960
 so much so that it is one of the best scenes of 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.370
 movie because it kept the wolverine right only 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.470
 who with shorter hair who 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.780
 Did you know you know what I'm talking about? 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.790
 without giving details of the script said that it is 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.400
 the best of them all about your 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.560
 joviality in the film well 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.690
 and recalled the healing power of the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.430
 character in which the makeup staff 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.429
 I suffered a little in the morning 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.440
 concerning this healing power that the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.769
 wolverine has that was very hard work there 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.510
 For the makeup people, do not you? 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.080
 even with this news regarding the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.150
 actor 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.220

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.120
 then leave the movie x-men apocalypse 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.460
 which will be released in May 2006 did not 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.130
 we know if jec will continue to be the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.800
 protagonist since the actor exterminated 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.620
 have recently had their doubts about 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.540
 I had spoken in the future 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.730

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.420

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.250
