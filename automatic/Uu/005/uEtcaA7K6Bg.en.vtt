we<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.190> three<00:00:35.430> reverb<00:00:35.730> types<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.329> studio

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we have three reverb types a studio

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380 
we have three reverb types a studio
church<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.250> plate<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> toe<00:00:39.180> knob

church and plate you have a toe knob

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
church and plate you have a toe knob
which<00:00:39.570> affects<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> tone<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.620> reverb

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
which affects the tone of the reverb

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.479 
which affects the tone of the reverb
signal<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.460> mix<00:00:42.270> knob<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.899> adjust<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> mix

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
signal a mix knob which adjust the mix

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
signal a mix knob which adjust the mix
between<00:00:44.640> dry<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> wet<00:00:45.510> signal<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.020> decay<00:00:46.500> knob

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
between dry and wet signal a decay knob

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
between dry and wet signal a decay knob
which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.309> nice<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.670> large<00:00:47.850> easy<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
which is nice and large easy to get to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
which is nice and large easy to get to
which<00:00:49.289> adjust<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> length<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> reverb<00:00:51.030> as

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
which adjust the length of the reverb as

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
which adjust the length of the reverb as
well<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> nice<00:00:52.079> clicky<00:00:52.559> turn<00:00:53.280> bypass<00:00:53.640> switch

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
well as a nice clicky turn bypass switch

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
well as a nice clicky turn bypass switch
so<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:55.680> we've<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> effect<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so we know when we've got the effect on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.420 
so we know when we've got the effect on
and<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.129> small

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and off this is because it's so small

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
and off this is because it's so small
there's<00:00:59.699> no<00:00:59.850> 9-volt<00:01:00.239> battery<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there's no 9-volt battery in here you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
there's no 9-volt battery in here you
cannot<00:01:01.379> fit<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.129> no<00:01:02.219> place

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
cannot fit one in here there's no place

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
cannot fit one in here there's no place
for<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
for it so you will need some kind of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
for it so you will need some kind of
external<00:01:04.379> power<00:01:04.680> supply<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> does<00:01:05.970> run

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
external power supply but this does run

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330 
external power supply but this does run
9<00:01:06.420> volt<00:01:06.659> standard<00:01:07.290> polarity<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> any<00:01:08.220> other

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
9 volt standard polarity to any other

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
9 volt standard polarity to any other
guitar<00:01:08.670> effect<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:09.540> draws<00:01:09.720> 128

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
guitar effect it only draws 128

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
guitar effect it only draws 128
milliamps<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> should<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> plenty<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
milliamps so you should have plenty of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
milliamps so you should have plenty of
power<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> majority<00:01:13.590> power<00:01:13.860> supplies

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
power with the majority power supplies

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
very thin sounding although all three

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
very thin sounding although all three
settings<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> have

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
noise of the reverb decays it's not

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.880 
noise of the reverb decays it's not
smooth<00:01:46.200> sounding<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.159> most<00:01:47.490> reverbs<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
smooth sounding like most reverbs are so

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.469 
smooth sounding like most reverbs are so
if<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.130> playing<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.090> ambient

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
if you're playing some more ambient

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
if you're playing some more ambient
noises<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.200> stuff<00:01:52.350> you're<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
noises and stuff you're really going to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.300 
noises and stuff you're really going to
hear<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> shortfalls<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:55.170> pedal<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
hear the shortfalls this pedal and as we

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
hear the shortfalls this pedal and as we
listen<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.030> you'll<00:01:57.240> hear<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.750> digital

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
listen to this you'll hear that digital

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010 
listen to this you'll hear that digital
decay<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.030> talking<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.479> enough

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
decay that I was talking about enough

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
decay that I was talking about enough
for<00:02:01.140> me<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.590> let's<00:02:01.950> plug<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.310> in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
for me a can let's plug this thing in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
for me a can let's plug this thing in
and<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.390> those<00:02:03.479> pedal<00:02:03.780> sounds

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and really see all those pedal sounds

00:02:04.140 --> 00:03:35.420 
and really see all those pedal sounds
and<00:02:04.259> let<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.770> ears<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.250> judge

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:04:40.770 

you

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.940 

all<00:04:41.780> right<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.140> after<00:04:42.440> I've<00:04:42.620> heard<00:04:42.740> that

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
all right so after I've heard that

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.830 
all right so after I've heard that
here's<00:04:43.250> my<00:04:43.310> thoughts<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.090> problems<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.600> pedal

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
here's my thoughts on problems the pedal

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.300 
here's my thoughts on problems the pedal
first<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.410> 8-bit<00:04:47.470> grungy<00:04:48.470> digital<00:04:49.220> noise

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
first is that 8-bit grungy digital noise

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.950 
first is that 8-bit grungy digital noise
I<00:04:49.550> was<00:04:49.610> telling<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:50.000> about<00:04:50.030> earlier<00:04:50.210> now

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
I was telling you about earlier now

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.810 
I was telling you about earlier now
here's<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.350> pedal<00:04:51.860> set<00:04:52.040> on<00:04:52.160> church<00:04:52.430> I've<00:04:52.640> got

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
here's the pedal set on church I've got

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.030 
here's the pedal set on church I've got
the<00:04:53.120> decay<00:04:53.990> set<00:04:54.230> pretty<00:04:54.440> high<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.890> can

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
the decay set pretty high so you can

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.250 
the decay set pretty high so you can
hear<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.400> tones<00:04:55.640> turned<00:04:56.000> up<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.870> mix<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.230> a

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
hear the tones turned up the mix is a

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.220 
hear the tones turned up the mix is a
little<00:04:57.470> higher<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.150> can<00:04:59.360> really<00:04:59.840> hear<00:05:00.080> the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
little higher so you can really hear the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.630 
little higher so you can really hear the
Sun<00:05:00.410> I'm<00:05:00.530> just<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> slap<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.130> strings

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
Sun I'm just going to slap the strings

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.990 
Sun I'm just going to slap the strings
and<00:05:01.970> you'll<00:05:02.360> be<00:05:02.510> able<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.840> hear<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:04.000> trailing

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and you'll be able to hear this trailing

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.410 
and you'll be able to hear this trailing
digital<00:05:05.630> garbage<00:05:09.730> I'll<00:05:10.730> turn<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.000> amp<00:05:11.120> up<00:05:11.300> so

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
digital garbage I'll turn the amp up so

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.500 
digital garbage I'll turn the amp up so
you<00:05:11.480> can<00:05:11.630> hear<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:16.300> can<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:17.360> hear<00:05:17.480> that

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
you can hear that can you hear that

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.590 
you can hear that can you hear that
flutter

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.410 

a<00:05:22.550> second<00:05:23.550> issue<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.760> find<00:05:23.970> with<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.120> reverb

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
a second issue I find with this reverb

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.230 
a second issue I find with this reverb
pedal<00:05:24.570> is<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.170> every<00:05:25.560> reverb<00:05:26.040> on<00:05:26.220> here<00:05:26.730> uses

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
pedal is that every reverb on here uses

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.920 
pedal is that every reverb on here uses
the<00:05:27.390> same<00:05:27.660> delay<00:05:28.290> style<00:05:28.800> reverb<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.720> if<00:05:30.780> we

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
the same delay style reverb so if we

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.080 
the same delay style reverb so if we
listen<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.710> studio<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.640> just<00:05:32.850> pluck<00:05:33.060> a

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
listen to the studio and I just pluck a

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.010 
listen to the studio and I just pluck a
chord<00:05:33.420> real<00:05:33.570> quick<00:05:33.750> here<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:36.270> can<00:05:36.450> hear<00:05:36.810> and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
chord real quick here you can hear and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.300 
chord real quick here you can hear and
I've<00:05:37.110> got<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.350> mix<00:05:37.530> turned<00:05:37.740> up<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.070> hear

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
I've got the mix turned up so you hear

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.160 
I've got the mix turned up so you hear
you<00:05:38.790> can<00:05:38.970> hear<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.390> it's<00:05:39.540> more<00:05:39.720> of<00:05:39.750> an<00:05:39.840> echo

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
you can hear that it's more of an echo

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:49.940 
you can hear that it's more of an echo
so<00:05:40.230> in<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.500> smooth<00:05:40.980> reverb<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:49.620> I<00:05:49.680> guess<00:05:49.830> you

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
so in a smooth reverb and I guess you

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.470 
so in a smooth reverb and I guess you
could<00:05:50.100> argue<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.460> sounds<00:05:50.970> like<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.210> sound

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
could argue that sounds like the sound

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.270 
could argue that sounds like the sound
is<00:05:51.630> bouncing<00:05:52.110> off<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.470> things<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.070> room

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.260 

but<00:05:56.280> it's<00:05:56.430> in<00:05:56.520> every<00:05:56.820> effect

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.650 

so<00:06:00.270> here<00:06:00.450> were<00:06:00.510> on<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.690> church<00:06:00.900> setting<00:06:02.660> it's

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
so here were on the church setting it's

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.500 
so here were on the church setting it's
way<00:06:03.990> more<00:06:04.020> prominent<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:09.000> here's<00:06:09.270> on<00:06:09.420> the

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
way more prominent and here's on the

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.600 
way more prominent and here's on the
plate<00:06:09.810> on<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:12.240> plate<00:06:12.390> side<00:06:12.840> I<00:06:12.870> like<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.470> sound

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.040 

because<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.730> me<00:06:17.820> it<00:06:17.940> sounds<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.330> a<00:06:18.450> spring<00:06:18.870> or

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
because to me it sounds like a spring or

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.600 
because to me it sounds like a spring or
a<00:06:19.110> plate<00:06:19.440> you<00:06:19.710> know<00:06:19.830> it's<00:06:19.980> being<00:06:20.130> pushed<00:06:20.370> real

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
a plate you know it's being pushed real

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.690 
a plate you know it's being pushed real
hard<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.740> find<00:06:22.950> that<00:06:23.040> it<00:06:23.160> works<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:23.580> this

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
hard so I find that it works in this

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.280 
hard so I find that it works in this
effect<00:06:24.090> but<00:06:24.270> in<00:06:24.360> others<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.780> doesn't<00:06:25.110> and

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
effect but in others it doesn't and

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.800 
effect but in others it doesn't and
again<00:06:25.650> if<00:06:25.770> I<00:06:25.860> turn<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.220> decay<00:06:26.490> all<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.730> way<00:06:26.850> up

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.279 

we<00:06:30.810> get<00:06:30.930> that<00:06:31.140> same<00:06:31.470> digital<00:06:32.310> garbage<00:06:32.730> as<00:06:32.880> the

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:43.080 

Reverb<00:06:38.289> trails<00:06:38.560> off<00:06:38.770> you<00:06:38.919> hear<00:06:39.129> that<00:06:42.090> that's

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
Reverb trails off you hear that that's
