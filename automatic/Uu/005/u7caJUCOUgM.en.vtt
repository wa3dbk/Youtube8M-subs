00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.290
 it's not like me anymore but they're 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.080
 super good I'm a kim reader and we're 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.019
 starting a game of things with what 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.509
 that they should know farc that is free for all 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.720
 and well this game I took it the end 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.699
 last week I think yes I think so 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.320
 I think it 's like a few weeks ago 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.090
 son-in-law or something like that, I took it out 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 but good until but you can not 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.250
 climb and I liked his departure was nothing 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.470
 more I'm not saying it's a game either 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.810
 extraordinary but it went pretty well 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.700
 and I wanted to get up and share it with 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.340
 you remember that of the weapons that 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.860
 more use is vall 27 because it is with the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.120
 that more comfortable and lately also with 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.510
 Asm 1 I think it's called something like that but 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.640
 well while he runs the game and see what 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.800
 very powerful that we went to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 start some things and first thing 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.180
 is that many of you ask me 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.400
 because I almost do not upload with iu because 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.650
 when I'm going to upload it again or things 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.780
 they 'll even ask you 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.310
 a lot about minecraft because almost no 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.770
 I upload minecraft and the truth is that yes 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.420
 I think of the last things I went up 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.509
 from minecraft well 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.490
 The Christmas series has about 2 months 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.619
 then do not eat graf well 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.540
 I lie but well there is no 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.939
 reason for a special so I wanted so is 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.560
 that I do not like anymore or whatever, but 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.009
 for example, talking about call of duty 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.200
 Well, you know, I already recorded in 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.530
 my house in most of the time by 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.430
 what is very complicated to record with the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.470
 I got it because the console is 1,900 in the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.320
 my girlfriend's house then I would have to 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.259
 come here and everything and then the idea of ​​having 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.819
 already as internet on my computer 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.450
 everything in my house afterwards is able to do 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:48.460
 things over there for my greater comfort 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.380
 let's say do not waste so much time on what 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.880
 I come here and all because as you know then 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.159
 I'm not in school and I do 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.170
 other activities in the afternoon and it's me 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.060
 very complicated to organize the time if 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.700
 in case you believe me it will cost me work in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.799
 imagine then for that reason then 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.869
 almost did not record now they will say ok but for 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.640
 example the weekend the ends of 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.190
 week there are some I take to make the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.989
 xlix because also this well as a 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.760
 good on weekdays to position them 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.450
 I take advantage to do the weekends 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.420
 so 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.700
 seventh serious is why for example 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.980
 this can always get us out on Friday 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.260
 because Friday is not the live and I 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.220
 I dedicated to play play play play up 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.300
 take out fairly decent games and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.040
 On the other hand, minecraft 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 I have uploaded minecraft because I have not 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.490
 found something that motivates me to climb 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.340
 more entries of the moment like yes 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.290
 I found something that I like but 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 I'm seeing the trees no longer 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.120
 I want to promise nothing because I do not know if 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.970
 go to upload this the idea as you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.900
 want to go up good is to upload a series 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.920
 with bots 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.130
 but it's hard for me 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.770
 upload it because I need to see everything 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.840
 serve well since then the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.440
 pack of mods then I need like that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.970
 be testing and testing and testing and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 I think I'm not, I'm not that bad for 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.490
 make pack of motorcycles that do not pass as 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.080
 30 to 35 ours has complicated because 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.180
 if we manage to do the Christmas series 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.160
 but I would have liked to do 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 a series with more no action to the best 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.360
 they get something like that I say total never 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.130
 ends using all the mods but 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.750
 good if you want because that can 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.960
 to do again I can do a series 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 as of 30 to 35 mods and occupy them stem 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.860
 a way of Eurovision is so that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.390
 is the truth is very fine is very 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.880
 feminine I liked it 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.680
 then I said good and just good 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.819
 yesterday I was watching that and in what 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.520
 I was watching, I was not 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.430
 rendering a gameplay of how much and 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.380
 was the light or like the voltage went down 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.300
 so 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
 the computer was turned off since it is not 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.560
 scare because I said it happened because 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.660
 I still had light in the bedroom but the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.400
 compu has turned off then you 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.870
 horrible and my sister told me that she 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.960
 the voltage has gone down then 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.640
 really that's what happened and that's why 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.380
 is that then I say are things that happen not 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.020
 for example yesterday that happened that because I already 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.780
 I was not going up the gameplay because I 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.970
 I fell asleep then they are things 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
 that happen and one can not help but 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.750
 basically that's what it does not mean 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.610
 that because I'm left to assume those games 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.709
 that mostly because they always go to 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.650
 have contents summarize I'm not going to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.720
 go up and I say I say it like that because there's a 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.130
 games that if we drew just 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.620
 yesterday it's not like I can continue 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.810
 going up from that you know because then no longer 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.780
 there's more content to come up from that game 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.790
 but I do not know what I see what's going on and 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.500
 everything now we have been asking 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.630
 the same cooperatives with no one 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.760
 I have the same plan to make 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.530
 cooperatives for people but really 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.540
 that the time that I have is very scarce and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.070
 It does the dark and above all right now 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.700
 I'm on low exams like nothing 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.700
 plus a week 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.640
 but 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.280
 I say the time that I have is like super 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.930
 very rare then sometimes it costs 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.730
 work to agree with the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.470
 people because nothing else since I 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.630
 can also since the other person 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.310
 may well maybe I can the ends 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.500
 week and that person not to the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.390
 weekends then are things that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.910
 peace of my productivity that if it's going to 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.680
 continue to have cooperative series main 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.050
 graphics just have a little bit of 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.240
 patience so good to it's over 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.520
 this game I think that from 30 to 11 if 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.800
 I do not remember badly and it does not come up they are living 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.360
 I say after heating a few 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.790
 games because the others I'm gone 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.440
 terrible but good if they want to continue 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.820
 seeing the types of items as well 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.770
 surpassing though I'm going fairly 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.210
 well do not forget to leave your super like and 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.210
 See you bye
