 the Italian is a Latina also the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.039
 Romanians consider themselves Latino 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.760
 in the way that we consider 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.769
 Latin or not the way we are 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.860

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.170

 it's easy enough yes because it's very 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.759
 similar to clear Italian would be more 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.600
 tropical urban 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.569
 that's why being a Romanian myself since I was little 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 I dreamed singing one day music in 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.440
 Spanish 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.310
 and good I learned the Spanish in the high 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.530

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 incorporating into the community 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.000
 Latin American and as they say I like 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.280

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.080
 Latin American as you would say 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.690
 I hope lazarito learn to play the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:17.470
 guitar would be from an oca lazaritos 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.930
 they spend in this poor Romanian collective 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.670

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.470

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.040
 with translator even in Chinese this 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.550
 It seems 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.800
 we speak and he speaks 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.690
 apart from the Spanish speak English 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 Italian and French the Roman by 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.140
 supposed 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.329
 good only when I speak it 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.000
 with my dads net but you already know that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.970
 in Cuba when I was a twenty-year-old boy 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.250
 years we saw one we saw a series of 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.780
 a series that was very popular they 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.069
 has to agree some of them a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.080
 series that was very popular in the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.880
 television that was Romanian 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.520
 no and the protagonist was an actor who 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.340
 it was my life all favorite is called 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.110
 serbian nikola school 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.560
 we have thought that the fascinated boy 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.690
 German 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.610
 and unique the scu that was the series of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.610
 commissioner the commissar's films 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.140
 but he assures that the human being in berlin 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.010
 sitting alone 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.910
 you are very famous for my generation and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 It is very elegant 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.730
 when when they sing the bachata when 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.310
 when the bachata you try to give your 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.050
 particular style or you try to do it 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.690
 more similar to what a Latino would 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.500
 when we say that I try to 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.180
 adapt it to what is bachata the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.590
 bachata that one day bachata is heard 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.490
 urban you want to try dancing with me 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.490
 with you 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.130
 I do not know much and I do not know much but 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.130
 now let's try 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.140
 do not 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.060
 I think there is no Dominican Republic 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.670
 the massive monophonic noise already apart from 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.630
 apart without telling me that other singers 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:41.820
 Latinos have good influence apart 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.830
 I like the music a lot 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.830
 a lot marc anthony lovely 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:55.759
 It's beautiful how the music has a 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.240
 very beautiful mind and let's say that the 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:02.120
 pop music singers like shakira 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.009
 like ricky martin and have this you have 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.020
 Romanian couple or good latina 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.659
 imagine that if they had had 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.460
 human words in today's my country already 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:19.729
 they have forgotten Roman and the couple is 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.059
 I forgot Spanish is Roman about 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.480
 words we speak in by basile by 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.640
 sleep by signal 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.880
 to sing not so that no no I can not 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880
 power 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.400
 means when he's going to sing but 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.400
 I do not know what I did wrong, I did it 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.880
 I did not intentionally make idiots that 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.740
 way it exists 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.740
 how to get it out kill him 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.680
 is more slowly to understand 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.370
 certain they told me that once singing 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.930
 in a concert visit there is a 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.580
 movement with your foot and it comes out 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.710
 You killed a dj shoe is sincere 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.199
 give a blow to the head was 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.360
 singing on stage and good 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.830
 dancing and Cantonese of a soon I do not know 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.319
 how I made a connection movement and 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.319
 had sandals sandals that are 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:20.889
 without the little thing back then a 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:24.419
 moment he arrived just where he was 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.419
 the office of the bad dj 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.339
 but here I had like a little window and 

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.339
 entered by the 33 on the head 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.570
 to those that should do the whole concert 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.340
 I would make you very famous 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.990

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.090

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:49.630
 to have to repeat the good scene 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.910

 these times of crisis a great 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.110
 Venezuelan businessman who wants 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.880
 address the population so that 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.310
 people can find ways to get out 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.729
 of difficult economic situations the 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.729
