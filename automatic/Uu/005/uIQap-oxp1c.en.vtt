00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 and hi guys it's pancake 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.410
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.520
 episode number two of the guide on 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 sales on diaries 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.510
 if we can not offer you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.870
 a tutorial on strategies this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.790
 map 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 after the round without a simply 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 because we realized with adrie that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 the change of the deal did not work 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.230
 and therefore no real 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.180
 strategies exist I distil base and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 this episode about the strategies of the no 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 power of young diaries recalls the no 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 power is arguably the most challenging 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.050
 known after the first room 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 it consists of not turning on the power 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 and to do as many sleeves as possible 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 and on black ops 2 in my opinion this is the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.059
 more complete and that's why I 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.710
 you do a little tutorial on it he can 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 seem simple but the strategies of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 snow power are really complex to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.489
 understand that's why I tell you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.530
 advise to look carefully 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 all the video if you want to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 manage this no power during this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 only explain to you the beginning of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 part and how to start it in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.949
 optimal conditions possible 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.570
 I therefore assume that you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.190
 know the map if it is not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 go directly to the guide 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 episode 1 concerning diaries we 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.129
 can finally start with the single player mode 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.229
 before you start, make sure you have assets 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 semi-permanent minima this rate is 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 tombstone it will also apply when 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 you will launch in solo cooperation the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.610
 only elevator working in the map 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.680
 apart from that of the first room 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.479
 larry mize lift the handle 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.220
 three guards at his be open the door 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.590
 and build piece by piece your 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 propeller take your centex evokes the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 dead then returned to first room and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 take the elevator then remove 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.250
 money in the bank at a minimum 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.630
 thirty thousand did not take up arms in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.759
 the fridge because it will not serve you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.829
 during the game then build 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.049
 your sli that made 14 and then place your 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.700
 thruster at this precise location in order to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.350
 return to the impasse once in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 the impasse destroy your propeller 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.400
 thanks to your grenades then find a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 key that is on the ground and kraft and there 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.030
 in order to go back in first round 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.799
 thanks to the elevator once the key 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.049
 kraft and go up as fast as possible 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.280
 because she will not wait for you again 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.750
 in strength Roma you can go from 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 patches and your slick do it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 crates in order to have the monkeys on 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.759
 diaries the ease of a water power and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.450
 that you can have assets through 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.159
 to the boom 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 for that you have to go get the handle 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.520
 was shooting a single bullet next to you I 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.469
 therefore advise to kill them to the point 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.909
 teaser or using your dead keys in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.250
 solo on this map it does not matter 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.840
 not have more than 4 at all because if you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 if you do, you will die 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.250
 no longer clicked viiv if I like 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.439
 you can not revive yourself with 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.969
 your who is who therefore you 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.140
 must imperatively that who 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.239
 enamelled the behemoths before 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.129
 exceed 4 at all and especially do not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.659
 have khaki because you play with stone 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.700
 tombstone which is much safer 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.959
 with you but explain yourself 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.970
 quickly the principle of stones 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.530
 tombstones this semi permanent asset allows 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.060
 to lose only the last trump that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.890
 you have when you die 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 so that's why it's important 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.340
 to have masto as soon as possible and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.439
 preferably before the round 15 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.659
 because if you get it after you will not get 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.950
 more minimal to stowe more masto but 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.750
 only mastodon 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.000
 in summary the perfect combination and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.530
 to have mastodon first then quick 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.659
 revised and then the last two 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.519
 assets matters little as long as it is not 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.230
 who is who is I remind him he does not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.060
 must not have more than 4 to toul 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.220
 advantage of having that cries vibe with the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.930
 goums is that you have one more 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.310
 for free if all the points that I have 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.870
 discussed regarding the assets are not 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.260
 not together it is better to start again 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.239
 part 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.459
 that's why I advise the right ones 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.290
 players to stay in first round of killing 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.870
 the gollum and see if they have 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.549
 quickly masto and quick revised so 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 not to waste time on everything 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.090
 build because if you're in 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.859
 do too much but you do not come across 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.299
 the right combination of assets could 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.099
 start again you will not lose 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.349
 time here's all crafter and to make a 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.760
 early part boring now 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.430
 you are ready to do a good 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.989
 part in water power solo then to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.609
 you manage the train stations pass 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.139
 now in co-op mode in this one 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.909
 you do not have to worry about 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.889
 assets as solo but preferably 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.930
 it's better to have masto before 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.370
 May 15th the difficult point is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.260
 that no elevator except that of the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.970
 first room does not work again 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.769
 keep a zombie in the 3-1 set of 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.780
 two players will stay in strong room with 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.760
 will open the door while the other 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.959
 will have to have 3000 points he will have to make 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.790
 go down the four pieces of 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.590
 thruster by proceeding as on the screen 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.120
 you will have to press several times 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.310
 carey while advancing so you can 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.109
 carry two pieces at the same time and 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.909
 one by one you make them fall into 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.889
 the lower tier and reiterate 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.139
 the operation until you get to the room 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.939
 thruster and build the next 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.489
 rendezvous in the corridors place 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.680
 your propeller is committed suicide you 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.419
 player in first room to finally kill the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.889
 zombie went to sleeve 4 both 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.079
 players will meet together in 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.820
 first room at the end of the cat kept from 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.650
 zombies then take the elevator 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.950
 be careful not to kill the zombies 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.450
 jumping throbbing thruster level 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.160
 the and the sli that removed thirty 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.750
 thousand points in the bank can 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520
 jump back into deadlock at 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.840
 using the propeller before kraft is 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.570
 the lift key you will need 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.310
 imperatively destroy as solo the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.560
 thruster using your grenades 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.240
 then go back up and then the player having the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.950
 who will have to go to the bar for the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.290
 patches and stay there while the other 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.540
 will fetch his thruster and clamor 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.770
 centex that same player will then go to the 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.900
 hole room to make crates 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.660
 in order to have the monkeys if the crate 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.070
 move to the bar the player being able 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.660
 to make crates to pick up monkeys 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.730
 and if she falls on the roof 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.710
 the player being the body of the m16 so 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.260
 at the checkout of the hole will have to place his 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.060
 thruster right here in order to get to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.220
 the tasks of the MP 5 to be able to do 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.270
 crates on the roof at the beginning of 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.920
 part both players can so 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
 having breasts I then started 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.520
 their game at the hole hall once 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.260
 both players at this location do 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.490
 crates becomes a real ordeal 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.720
 and that's where I stop a few 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.670
 moments to explain the 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.800
 difficulty of a water power co op on 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.450
 diaries it's very simple given 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.190
 that no lifts will work you 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.690
 can only move with the help of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.190
 your thruster in the map 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.780
 therefore in the high-end 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.310
 when your underpants that will be empty 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.200
 you will not be able to make crates 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.490
 freely because both players are 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.320
 will find at the hole hall and at 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.750
 from this one you will not be able 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.490
 you go on the roof with a pro 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.350
 able to access the cash therein 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.090
 so you will not have access which has two 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.950
 crates on three quarters that of the bar 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.600
 is inaccessible so here it appears 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.190
 at this point you are everything 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.720
 just fuck and especially do not 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.340
 returned more of the party in the 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.780
 corridors because there will be more way to 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.970
 go out once both players 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.710
 have come back in force trauma after 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.870
 have built the only problem he so in 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.550
 summed up in the 70's sleeves when you 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.350
 will no longer have ammo you have a 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.060
 little chance of getting a new one 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.280
 liquid through the strategy that I you 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.720
 have explained puts slaps and will be at 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.670
 bar you will not be able to change your 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.470
 this liquid is why it is 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.030
 impossible to do without a sleeve our 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.320
 power cup on diaries 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.790
 well here's the guys this guide from 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.170
 survivor is coming to an end I really 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.450
 had a hard time explaining you clearly 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.950
 how does this no power work 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.420
 really harder than it looks 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.340
 must really think and not do 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.200
 anything and for those who are 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.610
 would ask the question for the beginning of 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.930
 part in co-op I put about a 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.580
 time to find the strategy yes 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.470
 actually one of the two players is 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.760
 forced to commit suicide 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.980
 short guys that was the case that 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.330

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.020
