00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
I have here with me the ax soos 853 Z

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.480 
I have here with me the ax soos 853 Z
and<00:00:04.380> today<00:00:04.890> we're<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.430> to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
and today we're just going to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.670 
and today we're just going to
demonstrate<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.270> somewhat<00:00:06.930> mundane<00:00:07.140> but

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
demonstrate the somewhat mundane but

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280 
demonstrate the somewhat mundane but
potentially<00:00:08.490> useful<00:00:08.760> task<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.660> restoring<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
potentially useful task of restoring the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.680 
potentially useful task of restoring the
system<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.830> its<00:00:10.980> original<00:00:11.130> factory<00:00:11.969> state<00:00:12.450> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
system to its original factory state so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.970 
system to its original factory state so
first<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> hit<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> power

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
first of all I have to hit the power

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.279 
first of all I have to hit the power
button<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.719> then<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> start

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
button and then you have to start

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.550 
button and then you have to start
hitting<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.650> f9<00:00:16.980> key<00:00:17.039> as<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.520> boots<00:00:17.850> up<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
hitting the f9 key as it boots up and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.929 
hitting the f9 key as it boots up and
that<00:00:19.560> will<00:00:19.859> interrupt<00:00:20.130> boot<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.760> you'll

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
that will interrupt boot up and you'll

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
that will interrupt boot up and you'll
go<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.270> utility<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.080> allows<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.619> to

go into utility that allows you to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
go into utility that allows you to
restore<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> here<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.640> will<00:00:26.730> prompt

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
restore so here it is now it will prompt

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
restore so here it is now it will prompt
you<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.420> Windows<00:00:28.019> Windows<00:00:28.859> setup<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.670> has

all these files and in a second here

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
all these files and in a second here
we're<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.670> utility<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
we're going to get this utility that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
we're going to get this utility that
actually<00:00:48.809> allows<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> restore<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
system to its original factory state now
this<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.210> work<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> other<00:00:54.719> ESU's<00:00:55.079> laptops

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
this should work on other ESU's laptops

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.639 
this should work on other ESU's laptops

as how you want to recover the system

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
as how you want to recover the system
you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.860> recover<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.060> one

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you can recover just to the one

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.010 
you can recover just to the one
partition<00:01:44.119> across<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> entire<00:01:45.540> hard<00:01:45.899> drive

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
or recover Windows to entire hard drive

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
or recover Windows to entire hard drive
with<00:01:50.549> two<00:01:50.759> partitions<00:01:51.329> now<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> way<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.409> set

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
with two partitions now the way it's set

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
with two partitions now the way it's set
up<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> keep<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.700> recovery<00:01:54.210> partition

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
up I want to keep my recovery partition

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.179 
up I want to keep my recovery partition
so<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> say<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:55.979> just
