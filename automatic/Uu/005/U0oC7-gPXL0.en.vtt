how<00:00:25.620> do<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.860> think<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.340> new<00:00:26.520> technology<00:00:27.180> will

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
how do you think the new technology will

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.960 
how do you think the new technology will
make<00:00:27.480> learning<00:00:27.720> different<00:00:28.290> here<00:00:28.610> well<00:00:29.610> it's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
make learning different here well it's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
make learning different here well it's
going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.450> make<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> faster<00:00:31.320> easier<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.490> more

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
going to make it faster easier and more

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
going to make it faster easier and more
efficient<00:00:35.360> technology<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> new<00:00:36.900> future

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
efficient technology is the new future

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
efficient technology is the new future
and<00:00:37.650> we<00:00:37.770> should<00:00:37.950> embrace<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.700> our

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and we should embrace that in our

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
and we should embrace that in our
learning<00:00:41.720> how<00:00:42.720> do<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> new

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
learning how do you think that new

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
learning how do you think that new
technology<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:44.190> change<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> way<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.000> learn

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
technology will change the way we learn

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
technology will change the way we learn
here<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.629> think<00:00:46.470> that<00:00:46.559> new<00:00:46.890> technology<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.790> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
here I think that new technology for the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
here I think that new technology for the
school<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.570> provide<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.830> advanced<00:00:50.160> way

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
school will provide a more advanced way

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.619 
school will provide a more advanced way
for<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.150> us<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> learn<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:53.390> think<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> new

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
for all of us to learn I think the new

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.509 
for all of us to learn I think the new
technology<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.290> make<00:00:55.589> us<00:00:55.769> for<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> faster

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
technology will make us for and faster

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.990 
technology will make us for and faster
and<00:00:56.730> better<00:00:57.890> let's<00:00:58.890> watch<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.339> educational
