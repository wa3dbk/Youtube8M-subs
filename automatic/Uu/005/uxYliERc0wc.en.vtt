first thing is simple we need to know
that<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.930> Earth<00:01:08.050> revolves<00:01:08.530> around<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.400> Sun

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
that the Earth revolves around the Sun

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.330 
that the Earth revolves around the Sun
and<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:11.170> revolution<00:01:11.830> of<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.040> earth<00:01:12.070> around

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
and one revolution of the earth around

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.860 
and one revolution of the earth around
the<00:01:12.550> Sun<00:01:12.790> takes<00:01:13.120> 365<00:01:14.130> point<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.400> six<00:01:15.700> days<00:01:15.970> or<00:01:16.210> a

the Sun takes 365 point to six days or a
year<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.130> don't<00:01:18.400> need<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.610> memorize<00:01:19.030> this

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
year now you don't need to memorize this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.760 
year now you don't need to memorize this
number<00:01:19.300> because<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.930> can<00:01:20.080> be<00:01:20.200> found<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.710> your

and the North Pole of the Sun and look

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.210 
and the North Pole of the Sun and look
down<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.870> them<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.560> would<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
down in them you would see that the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.980 
down in them you would see that the
Earth<00:01:30.340> revolves<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:31.270> counterclockwise

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
the Sun 360 degrees and it takes the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.970 
the Sun 360 degrees and it takes the
earth<00:01:47.820> 365<00:01:48.820> days<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.480> do<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:50.830> you

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
earth 365 days to do this so if you

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.310 
earth 365 days to do this so if you
divide<00:01:51.720> 360<00:01:52.720> degrees<00:01:53.050> by<00:01:54.030> 365<00:01:55.030> days<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.080> get<00:01:56.260> a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
divide 360 degrees by 365 days you get a

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.740 
divide 360 degrees by 365 days you get a

most<00:02:14.620> likely<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.489> traced<00:02:15.819> back<00:02:16.090> to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
most likely they can be traced back to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.300 
most likely they can be traced back to
the<00:02:16.450> Earth's<00:02:16.659> revolution<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.890> most<00:02:18.099> obvious

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the Earth's revolution the most obvious

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.119 
the Earth's revolution the most obvious
example<00:02:18.640> are<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.510> seasons<00:02:19.989> we<00:02:20.560> know<00:02:20.769> we<00:02:20.980> go

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
example are the seasons we know we go

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.220 
example are the seasons we know we go
through<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> full<00:02:21.610> cycle<00:02:21.670> seasons<00:02:22.450> every<00:02:22.840> year

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
through a full cycle seasons every year

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.619 
through a full cycle seasons every year
so<00:02:23.650> they<00:02:23.769> are<00:02:23.890> caused<00:02:24.129> at<00:02:24.430> least<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.790> part<00:02:25.060> by

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
so they are caused at least in part by

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.600 
so they are caused at least in part by
the<00:02:25.690> Earth's<00:02:25.989> revolution<00:02:26.610> another

the Earth's revolution another
interesting<00:02:28.150> change<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.319> ability<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.890> see

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430

motion<00:02:54.359> let's<00:02:55.359> talk<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.660> rotation<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.500> a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
motion let's talk about rotation for a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.860 
motion let's talk about rotation for a
moment<00:02:56.829> rotation<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.970> Earth's<00:02:58.120> spin<00:02:58.420> on

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
moment rotation is the Earth's spin on

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.630 
moment rotation is the Earth's spin on
its<00:02:59.290> axis<00:02:59.859> we<00:03:00.430> complete<00:03:00.849> one<00:03:00.879> spin<00:03:01.480> every<00:03:02.079> day

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
its axis we complete one spin every day

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.420 
its axis we complete one spin every day
let's<00:03:03.640> jot<00:03:03.879> down<00:03:03.909> some<00:03:04.269> notes<00:03:04.299> about<00:03:04.720> rotation

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
let's jot down some notes about rotation

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.430 
let's jot down some notes about rotation
so<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.459> Earth<00:03:06.670> rotates<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.299> spins<00:03:07.659> around<00:03:08.019> its

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
so the Earth rotates or spins around its

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.809 
so the Earth rotates or spins around its
axis<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:09.190> rotation

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
axis of rotation

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.520 
axis of rotation
now<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.269> axis<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.780> rotation<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.349> this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
now the axis of rotation is this

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.530 
now the axis of rotation is this
imaginary<00:03:12.190> line<00:03:12.430> from<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.879> North<00:03:13.030> Pole<00:03:13.329> to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
imaginary line from the North Pole to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.830 
imaginary line from the North Pole to
the<00:03:13.569> South<00:03:13.690> Pole<00:03:13.900> around<00:03:14.829> which<00:03:15.099> we<00:03:15.310> spin<00:03:15.840> one

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
the South Pole around which we spin one

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.860 
the South Pole around which we spin one
complete<00:03:17.319> rotation<00:03:17.530> takes<00:03:18.250> 23<00:03:19.150> hours<00:03:19.450> 56

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
complete rotation takes 23 hours 56

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.379 
complete rotation takes 23 hours 56
minutes<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.500> four<00:03:21.250> seconds<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.239> could

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
minutes and four seconds but you could

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.809 
minutes and four seconds but you could
leave<00:03:22.569> off<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.959> four<00:03:23.169> seconds<00:03:23.819> essentially

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
leave off the four seconds essentially

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.599 
leave off the four seconds essentially
one<00:03:25.030> rotation<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.690> one<00:03:26.049> day<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:27.370> if<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.549> were

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
one rotation is one day now if you were

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.129 
one rotation is one day now if you were
to<00:03:27.669> look<00:03:27.849> at<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.030> Earth<00:03:28.120> from<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.389> side<00:03:28.720> at

imaginary<00:04:12.910> line<00:04:13.030> through<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.599> North<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
imaginary line through the North and

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.319 
imaginary line through the North and
South<00:04:14.019> Pole<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:15.250> draw<00:04:15.489> an<00:04:15.609> arrow<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.970> show

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
South Pole and you draw an arrow to show

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.979 
South Pole and you draw an arrow to show
the<00:04:16.510> west<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.049> east<00:04:17.250> rotation<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:19.599> let's<00:04:19.780> take

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
the west to east rotation so let's take

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.689 
the west to east rotation so let's take
a<00:04:20.019> moment<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.500> take<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.859> look<00:04:21.130> at<00:04:21.280> what<00:04:21.489> all<00:04:21.669> of

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
a moment and take a look at what all of

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.460 
a moment and take a look at what all of
this<00:04:21.969> actually<00:04:22.690> looks<00:04:22.990> like

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.379 

okay<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:26.919> here<00:04:27.220> we<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.460> see<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.819> inner<00:04:28.000> part

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
okay so here we can see the inner part

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.480 
okay so here we can see the inner part
of<00:04:28.569> the<00:04:28.750> solar<00:04:28.990> system<00:04:29.500> let<00:04:29.680> me<00:04:29.770> just<00:04:29.979> turn<00:04:30.190> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
of the solar system let me just turn the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.460 
of the solar system let me just turn the
time<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.449> get<00:04:31.569> us<00:04:31.720> moving<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.229> little<00:04:32.350> bit

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
time on and get us moving a little bit

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.439 
time on and get us moving a little bit
here<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.919> if<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.550> focus<00:04:33.759> right<00:04:34.090> here<00:04:34.270> you'll

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
here and if you focus right here you'll

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.730 
here and if you focus right here you'll
see<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.750> earth<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.169> you<00:04:35.259> can<00:04:35.289> see<00:04:35.620> it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
see the earth and you can see it

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.100 
see the earth and you can see it
rotating<00:04:35.949> around<00:04:36.430> its<00:04:36.759> axis<00:04:36.940> once<00:04:37.509> a<00:04:37.660> day<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
rotating around its axis once a day and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.140 
rotating around its axis once a day and
at<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.710> same<00:04:38.889> time<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.340> it's<00:04:39.490> rotating<00:04:40.030> you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
at the same time that it's rotating you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.059 
at the same time that it's rotating you
can<00:04:40.300> see<00:04:40.479> by<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.720> blue<00:04:41.139> path<00:04:41.380> here<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.889> is

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
can see by this blue path here that is

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.390 
can see by this blue path here that is
its<00:04:42.250> orbit<00:04:42.729> as<00:04:42.880> it<00:04:43.419> revolves<00:04:43.930> around<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.259> Sun

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
its orbit as it revolves around the Sun

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
its orbit as it revolves around the Sun
now<00:04:45.400> in<00:04:45.550> order<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.940> see<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.569> revolution<00:04:46.870> take

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
now in order to see a revolution take

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.730 
now in order to see a revolution take
place<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.949> will<00:04:48.009> have<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.460> speed<00:04:48.759> up<00:04:48.970> time<00:04:49.349> as<00:04:50.349> it

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
place I will have to speed up time as it

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.650 
place I will have to speed up time as it
you<00:04:51.160> know<00:04:51.280> happens<00:04:51.699> pretty<00:04:51.970> slowly<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.479> takes

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
you know happens pretty slowly it takes

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.059 
you know happens pretty slowly it takes
about<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.900> year<00:04:53.229> so<00:04:53.380> I'm<00:04:53.470> going<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.680> increase

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
about a year so I'm going to increase

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.790 
about a year so I'm going to increase
let's<00:04:54.669> do<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.060> daily<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.810> here<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.620> see

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
let's do it daily and here you can see

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.710 
let's do it daily and here you can see
the<00:04:57.009> earth<00:04:57.039> spinning<00:04:57.580> once<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:58.090> day<00:04:58.270> very

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
the earth spinning once a day very

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.290 
the earth spinning once a day very
quickly<00:04:59.020> here<00:04:59.410> as<00:04:59.530> it<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.400> revolving<00:05:00.910> around

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
quickly here as it is revolving around

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.350 
quickly here as it is revolving around
the<00:05:01.630> Sun<00:05:02.190> also<00:05:03.190> notice<00:05:03.699> some<00:05:03.970> things<00:05:04.000> we

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
the Sun also notice some things we

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.879 
the Sun also notice some things we
learned<00:05:04.570> earlier<00:05:04.930> on<00:05:05.199> which<00:05:05.440> are<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.740> the

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
learned earlier on which are that the

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.620 
learned earlier on which are that the
planets<00:05:06.370> closer<00:05:06.639> to<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.060> Sun<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.449> mercury

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
planets closer to the Sun like mercury

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.439 
planets closer to the Sun like mercury
and<00:05:08.050> venus<00:05:08.110> take<00:05:08.740> less<00:05:09.039> time<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.580> orbit<00:05:09.970> well

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
and venus take less time to orbit well

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.120 
and venus take less time to orbit well
as<00:05:10.570> you<00:05:10.690> get<00:05:10.840> further<00:05:11.080> out<00:05:11.229> they<00:05:11.530> take<00:05:11.740> more

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
as you get further out they take more

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.999 
as you get further out they take more
time<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:13.180> there's<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.570> earth<00:05:13.690> rotating<00:05:14.289> as<00:05:14.410> it

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
time so there's the earth rotating as it

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.310 
time so there's the earth rotating as it
is<00:05:15.250> revolving<00:05:15.759> I<00:05:16.240> can<00:05:16.659> turn<00:05:16.840> this<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.229> side

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
is revolving I can turn this to the side

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.749 
is revolving I can turn this to the side
a<00:05:17.590> little<00:05:17.830> bit<00:05:17.949> so<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.280> can<00:05:18.310> get<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> better

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
a little bit so you can get a better

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.550 
a little bit so you can get a better
idea<00:05:18.909> of<00:05:19.210> what<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.539> looks<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.380> can

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
idea of what it looks like and I can

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.520 
idea of what it looks like and I can
zoom<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:21.509> so<00:05:22.509> we<00:05:22.659> can<00:05:22.810> see<00:05:22.990> what<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.289> looks

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
zoom in so we can see what this looks

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.100 
zoom in so we can see what this looks
like<00:05:23.710> now<00:05:24.430> as<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.849> earth<00:05:25.000> comes<00:05:25.360> around<00:05:25.659> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
like now as the earth comes around the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.499 
like now as the earth comes around the
backside<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.949> Sun<00:05:27.190> here<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.729> will<00:05:28.180> slow<00:05:28.389> it

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
backside of the Sun here I will slow it

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.210 
backside of the Sun here I will slow it
down<00:05:28.569> so<00:05:28.900> we<00:05:28.990> can<00:05:29.139> get<00:05:29.259> a<00:05:29.320> closer<00:05:29.620> look<00:05:29.919> at<00:05:30.070> what

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
down so we can get a closer look at what

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.210 
down so we can get a closer look at what
the<00:05:30.400> rotation<00:05:31.360> actually<00:05:32.080> looks<00:05:32.349> like<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:33.159> I'm

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
the rotation actually looks like so I'm

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.770 
the rotation actually looks like so I'm
going<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.430> stop<00:05:33.789> it<00:05:34.030> here

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
going to stop it here

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.680 
going to stop it here
and<00:05:34.900> we<00:05:35.860> will<00:05:36.009> go<00:05:36.159> a<00:05:36.190> little<00:05:36.580> bit<00:05:36.849> slower<00:05:37.360> and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
and we will go a little bit slower and

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.170 
and we will go a little bit slower and
so<00:05:38.590> here<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:38.949> can<00:05:39.130> see<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.430> earth<00:05:39.460> rotating

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
so here you can see the earth rotating

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.170 
so here you can see the earth rotating
and<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:41.770> is<00:05:41.979> though<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.490> doesn't<00:05:42.639> look<00:05:42.789> like<00:05:43.030> it

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
and it is though it doesn't look like it

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.969 
and it is though it doesn't look like it
it<00:05:43.300> is<00:05:43.419> still<00:05:43.570> revolving<00:05:44.169> around<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.500> Sun<00:05:44.710> but

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
it is still revolving around the Sun but

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.709 
it is still revolving around the Sun but
remember<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.550> only<00:05:45.669> moving<00:05:46.000> about<00:05:46.419> one

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
remember it's only moving about one

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.800 
remember it's only moving about one
degree<00:05:46.960> of<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.710> complete<00:05:48.099> orbit<00:05:48.580> per<00:05:48.909> day<00:05:49.150> so

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
degree of the complete orbit per day so

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.649 
degree of the complete orbit per day so
it's<00:05:49.960> not<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.169> very<00:05:50.320> noticeable<00:05:51.159> motion<00:05:51.820> we<00:05:52.630> are

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659
