high on Connor Joe he's going to get two
as<00:00:19.920> well

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
as well

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.080

high in a bit late obviously Connor

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.640

Jones<00:00:24.359> had<00:00:24.600> gotten<00:00:24.779> rid<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> park<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.500> he

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Jones had gotten rid of the park so he

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
Jones had gotten rid of the park so he
wasn't<00:00:25.830> expecting<00:00:26.340> being<00:00:26.550> hit<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.789> he<00:00:26.880> got

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
wasn't expecting being hit and he got

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.259 
wasn't expecting being hit and he got
hit<00:00:27.180> pretty<00:00:27.210> hard<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.650> depending<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
hit pretty hard so depending if it's a I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.790 
hit pretty hard so depending if it's a I
got<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.260> two<00:00:31.410> minute<00:00:31.529> minor

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
got a think it's just a two minute minor

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
got a think it's just a two minute minor
he<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> great<00:00:32.430> effort<00:00:32.610> that's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> tripping

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
he was a great effort that's a tripping

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.220 
he was a great effort that's a tripping
about<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.600> puck<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.899> nowhere<00:00:40.079> near

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
about it and the puck was nowhere near

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
about it and the puck was nowhere near
him<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.649> obviously<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.399> least<00:00:41.489> an

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
him so obviously going to be at least an

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.810 
him so obviously going to be at least an
interference<00:00:43.399> it<00:00:44.399> could<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> two

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
interference it could be two and two

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.619 
interference it could be two and two
depending<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:51.710> an<00:00:52.710> attempt<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> injure<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.629> hit

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
depending on an attempt to injure or hit

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.850 
depending on an attempt to injure or hit
to<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> head<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.289> thought<00:00:55.500> he<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.710> his

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to the head I really thought he got his

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
to the head I really thought he got his
shoulder<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.719> we're<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.809> say<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
shoulder there but we're gonna say it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.340 
shoulder there but we're gonna say it
was<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> head<00:00:58.710> shot<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.160> Shane<00:00:59.789> gosh

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 

certainly<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> intent<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> appear<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
certainly the intent was that appear to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
certainly the intent was that appear to
be<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.140> high<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.640> enough<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
be a bit high and that was enough in a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.740 
be a bit high and that was enough in a
5-1<00:01:09.479> game

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
5-1 game

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.210 
5-1 game
let's<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> bury<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.830> obviously

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
let's see you bury them was obviously

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
let's see you bury them was obviously
the<00:01:11.369> puck<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.670> nowhere<00:01:11.850> near<00:01:12.000> him<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.509> he<00:01:12.690> was

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the puck was nowhere near him so he was

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
the puck was nowhere near him so he was
kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.740> beer<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.369> right<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.580> Jones

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
kind of beer if you see right now Jones

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
kind of beer if you see right now Jones
has<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> puck<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.259> his<00:01:16.470> stick

so<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.080> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.260> be<00:01:56.320> four<00:01:56.620> on<00:01:56.650> four<00:01:57.190> for<00:01:57.880> two

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
so it's going to be four on four for two

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.480
