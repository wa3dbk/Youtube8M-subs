you to do damage and you use the Ruby

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.190 
you to do damage and you use the Ruby
for<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.880> healing<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.869> very

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
for all of your healing so it's a very

for all of your healing so it's a very
very<00:01:41.479> handy<00:01:42.479> tool<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.079> especially<00:01:43.380> with

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
very handy tool to have especially with

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
very handy tool to have especially with
builds<00:01:44.340> where<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.479> points

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
builds where you have a lot of points

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
builds where you have a lot of points
invested<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.649> trying<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> keep<00:01:47.159> yourself

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
invested into trying to keep yourself

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
invested into trying to keep yourself
alive<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:48.960> invest<00:01:49.470> more

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
alive this way you could invest more

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
alive this way you could invest more
points<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.640> damage<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
points into doing more damage and you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
points into doing more damage and you
could<00:01:51.960> use<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> Ruby<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.280> your

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
could use the Ruby to do all your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
could use the Ruby to do all your
healing<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.840> turn<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> into

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
healing so you see here we turn it into

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
healing so you see here we turn it into
moxie<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.979> end<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.369> getting<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.850> elegant<00:01:57.299> Ruby

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
moxie we end up getting an elegant Ruby

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
moxie we end up getting an elegant Ruby
that<00:01:57.899> has<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.320> slag<00:01:58.860> which<00:01:59.189> isn't<00:01:59.340> too<00:01:59.610> bad

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that has a slag which isn't too bad

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
that has a slag which isn't too bad
I've<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.509> got<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> nice<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> side

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I've actually got a nice one on the side

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
I've actually got a nice one on the side
that<00:02:01.860> has<00:02:01.920> electric<00:02:03.049> element<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that has electric element and it's the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
that has electric element and it's the
one<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.829> using<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
one I'm using right here this is the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
one I'm using right here this is the
beat<00:02:06.570> down<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:07.049> got<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.350> rough<00:02:07.530> rider'

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
beat down I've got the rough rider'

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.650 
beat down I've got the rough rider'
shield<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.489> means<00:02:08.729> any<00:02:08.970> damage<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.450> take

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
shield on which means any damage I take

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
shield on which means any damage I take
directly<00:02:10.560> hits<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:10.979> health

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
directly hits my health

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.459 
directly hits my health
so<00:02:11.939> I<00:02:12.120> threw<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> few<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.719> those<00:02:12.810> grenades<00:02:13.230> out

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:13.469 
so I threw a few of those grenades out

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.679 
so I threw a few of those grenades out
now<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.680> watch<00:02:14.069> how<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.519> damage<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.390> tank

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
now you watch how much damage I tank

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.399 
now you watch how much damage I tank
here<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:17.340> there<00:02:17.549> I'm<00:02:17.790> corroding<00:02:18.689> like<00:02:19.019> if<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
here right there I'm corroding like if I

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.190 
here right there I'm corroding like if I
if<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.340> didn't<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.939> those<00:02:21.359> grenades<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
if I didn't have those grenades out and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.839 
if I didn't have those grenades out and
if<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.349> wasn't<00:02:22.560> using<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.040> Ruby<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> would<00:02:23.730> have

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
if I wasn't using the Ruby I would have

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.129 
if I wasn't using the Ruby I would have
been<00:02:24.060> dead<00:02:24.329> in<00:02:24.510> seconds

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
been dead in seconds

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.509 
been dead in seconds
I<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.409> have<00:02:25.530> been<00:02:25.620> down<00:02:25.829> in<00:02:26.069> seconds

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
I would have been down in seconds

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.059 
I would have been down in seconds
because<00:02:26.999> I<00:02:27.209> can<00:02:27.420> heal<00:02:28.019> faster<00:02:28.709> than<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:28.950> I

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
because I can heal faster than that I

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.429 
because I can heal faster than that I
can<00:02:29.280> take<00:02:29.519> damage<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.569> means<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.109> stay<00:02:31.319> on

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
can take damage it means I can stay on

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.709 
can take damage it means I can stay on
my<00:02:31.560> feet<00:02:31.799> it's<00:02:31.950> very<00:02:32.219> very<00:02:32.459> handy<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.569> this

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
my feet it's very very handy and in this

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.929 
my feet it's very very handy and in this
flight<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.290> an<00:02:34.469> absolute<00:02:35.010> must<00:02:35.219> especially

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.640 
flight it's an absolute must especially
if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.060> use<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.420> siren<00:02:36.659> it's<00:02:37.200> about<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.590> only

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
if you use the siren it's about the only

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.679 
if you use the siren it's about the only
way<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.909> actually<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:39.419> a<00:02:39.450> sample

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
way that you can actually get a sample

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.500 
way that you can actually get a sample
of<00:02:40.049> fat<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.129> short<00:02:41.459> period<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.879> time<00:02:41.939> so<00:02:42.389> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
of fat in a short period of time so that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.869 
of fat in a short period of time so that
you<00:02:42.599> can<00:02:42.629> civil<00:02:43.049> IVs<00:02:43.290> nigel<00:02:43.680> blasts<00:02:44.159> so<00:02:44.790> I'm

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
you can civil IVs nigel blasts so I'm

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.670 
you can civil IVs nigel blasts so I'm
down<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.209> six<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.629> half<00:02:45.689> thousand<00:02:46.290> Hilbert

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
down to six and a half thousand Hilbert

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.369 
down to six and a half thousand Hilbert
I<00:02:46.889> throw<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.489> couple<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.939> grenades<00:02:48.379> and

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.149 
second blast it's all because of the
Ruby<00:03:09.719> and<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.930> see<00:03:10.109> now<00:03:10.319> my<00:03:10.500> health<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.889> all

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
Ruby and you see now my health is all

Ruby and you see now my health is all
coming<00:03:11.459> back<00:03:11.579> back<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.449> max<00:03:12.689> health<00:03:12.959> which

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
coming back back to max health which

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.289 
coming back back to max health which
means<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.919> survive<00:03:14.159> another<00:03:14.280> two<00:03:14.849> Nova's

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
means I can survive another two Nova's

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.420 
means I can survive another two Nova's
if<00:03:15.419> you<00:03:15.540> did<00:03:15.689> them<00:03:15.840> right<00:03:16.049> now<00:03:16.280> he<00:03:17.280> was

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
if you did them right now he was

something<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:17.819> was<00:03:17.970> trying<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.359> test<00:03:18.629> which<00:03:18.870> was

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
something I was trying to test which was

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.360 
something I was trying to test which was
interesting<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:19.680> trying<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:20.009> see<00:03:20.220> whether

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
interesting I was trying to see whether

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.949 
interesting I was trying to see whether
it<00:03:20.549> would<00:03:20.729> work<00:03:20.939> with<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> non<00:03:21.419> elemental

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it would work with a non elemental

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.839 
it would work with a non elemental
weapon<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.439> then<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.650> remembered<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.400> actually

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
weapon but then I remembered I actually

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.170 
weapon but then I remembered I actually
had<00:03:24.329> my<00:03:25.319> badass<00:03:25.859> points<00:03:26.370> enabled<00:03:27.030> which

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
had my badass points enabled which

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.569 
had my badass points enabled which
actually<00:03:27.569> gives<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> 10%<00:03:28.439> chance<00:03:28.949> to<00:03:29.340> get

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
actually gives you a 10% chance to get

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.240 
actually gives you a 10% chance to get
elemental<00:03:30.209> effects<00:03:30.629> but<00:03:31.079> even<00:03:31.799> with<00:03:31.979> such<00:03:32.220> a
