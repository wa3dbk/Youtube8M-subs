00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 Today I'm doing top five call of duty 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.410
 I talk about that in the year of the call 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 of duty experience try that for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 No comments in your chin today 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 which sequence their 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 favorite products are 115 comments 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 now in my opinion very 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.519
 justice would be the fifth space is something 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 before the game has it as a lot 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.689
 put in and hoped that we were fine 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 accept that giving has become so 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 reasonably well-proven it is very cool 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 to go to the base are very cool 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 easy money to escalate naturally 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
 That's only possible if you talk about topics 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.300
 I play against the best games so 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 even transport what do you say to that? 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.010
 I think that someone has the idea 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.539
 behind it was not the execution or 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.020
 well done during the game 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.510
 a bit poor on fourth place 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.309
 I got myself black ops 1 can at 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.780
 when will the topic be extremely stable? 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.190
 the game was fun there 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 just with the weapons reasonably 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 reasonably constant 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 the maps was one though they were here 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 cold war and she has dark maps 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.979
 but many have remembered that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 celebrated and I was also very small because 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.479
 is thus very stable games true 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.400
 you 're pretty much going to break free 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 we almost find third place 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.890
 my favorites it is modern warfare 2 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 the first reason the first game why me 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 call of duty really regularly 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 regularly played one regularly 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 long-term motivation is after 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 actually not so had such a thing 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.829
 Of course lucas small but I mean the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.430
 news in modern warfare 2 was on hold 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.530
 channel 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.689
 they've tried a lot for him 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130
 achieve what was the win 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.470
 that was really annoying 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.150
 pure game determination i am alive 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.829
 I have lived that I think about 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.700
 1000 hours played meanwhile her 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 I can also comment in the comments 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 write 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 like which game which kfd you on 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.490
 most have played it will be slow 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.950
 exciting welcome to the 2 0 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.930
 second place we have modern warfare 1 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.659
 call of duty 4 that call of duty is not 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 that started 67 years ago 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.409
 gamer i just got it i am i say 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.430
 looking for that I'm doing it now no I 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.049
 I have the race because I have that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.759
 The game is learned on a game 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.170
 campaign one of the best call of duty 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.250
 parts have ever been 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.349
 You could say here maybe 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.599
 black ops 1 better hiking or now 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.970
 just modern warfare are stupid where the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.349
 that means exactly 41 I found that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.440
 Properly held it just has fun 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.599
 made to run around and yes the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.230
 Clenched one makes that it was parents 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.880
 westheim but my ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.650
 It would be different from expected space number 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.319
 one we have black ops second game 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.110
 what you really think through 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.420
 could last two years at least three years 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 look at 24 people in my french liszt 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.380
 No borsdorfer played only 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.989
 black ops 2 that he held himself 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.640
 It was constant the nuclear borders 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.640
 I now have over 1500 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.420
 unstoppable medals and it works 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.980
 steadily continue where of course at the beginning was 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.660
 he is a horny by turns as 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.459
 solist but black ops 2 we hope 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.040
 Just look at black ops three that 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.430
 just as eternal as black ops 2 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.989
 so that was my side of 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.150
 research the comments on what we do 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 video was cool and what we next 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.609
 want to see on this channel and 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.380
 of course, like her one to five 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.000
 rated what are your pot at one 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.630
 call of duty title is the next 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.630
 at times
