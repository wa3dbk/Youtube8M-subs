 constantly there is if 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.990
 we won because I do not know how much will be worth 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.990
 here 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.730

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.049
 you can not say anything 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.080
 he has to be afraid to cross me 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.080

 where to get here arrives arrives arrives vale 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.790
 I think the race can be 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.470
 if we turn around I think it has to 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.910
 be little and quiet here I have the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.470
