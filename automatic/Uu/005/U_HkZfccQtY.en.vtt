00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.480
 a pine- style makeup that asked me 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.820

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.529
 girl that has been very very nice with me 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.050
 and I was a little bit wrong with this 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.509
 makeup me too late but for 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.909
 end here is I hope you like it and 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.789

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.190
 Alejandra who is my friend of the umh and me 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.870
 He said it was good because he did not do it and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.960
 I said yes I have already done 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.210
 do it but I'm missing the bandana 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.780
 that she lends me her bandana 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.489
 in the week I give it back and well 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.420
 I hope you like the video that 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.040
 I like makeup and I leave them with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.850
 moisturizer I will put the base and I will 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 combine these 2 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 in the area of ​​dark circles 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.740
 Now I'm going to teach all this with a 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.740
 translucent powder 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.970
 I'm going to slightly turn my cheekbones 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.290
 and I'm going to put a little bit of blush 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.260
 now in the eyes I'm going to put a 1st 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.960
 all over the mobile eyelid 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.370
 and the palette of 252 colors I'm going to start 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 applying this color 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.350
 basically the eyes are very naked what 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 The only thing that makes us stand out is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.630
 the outline and lashes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 Now I'm going to drink this coffee 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.709
 and I'm going to start blurring 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.709
 the color that I put before 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 with a vanilla color 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.200
 I'm going to light up the brow bone 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 with this brown color I'm going to give shape to 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670
 my eyebrows 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.330
 generally dress pines 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.660
 use the well-marked eyebrow and meanwhile 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.660
 gross 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.060
 now the delineated that is something pretty 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.420
 main and very characteristic of this 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.980
 style is a pretty feline outlining 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.159
 and for that I'm going to use my store 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.019
 online black and a bevelled brush I'll 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.569
 start doing a line where 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.569
 end my eye towards eyebrow direction 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.439
 from the tip of the line pull towards 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.799
 inside and now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.799
 Fill 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.680
 now I'm going to delineate the water line 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.359
 with a white pencil 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.359
 but only the bottom 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.040
 I will outline it at the top 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 with black 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.020
 this is going to give a more eyelash effect 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.020
 abundant 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.379
 and now I'm going to wear false eyelashes 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.379
 from the bottom 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.729
 and good one of the protagonists also 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.000
 in this makeup are the lips that 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.400
 are usually a deep red 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.530
 worry my father I will be 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 using the first one this pencil that is 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.960
 the hot tango network 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.990
 and now I'm going to apply the most beautiful 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.990
 color of jordan to which is the scarlett 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.440
 for the hairstyle 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.930
 I will separate a section of hair 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.930
 as a rectangle more or less 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.480
 and I'm going to use one of these as 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.430
 wires 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.250
 so they sell them as wires 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.200
 combs for combing are worth 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.770
 relatively very cheap they are worth as 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.080
 five pesos each are flexible and 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.159
 Well, I'm going to do the flip 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.159
 very delicate 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.999
 and you have to divide the section I'm going to 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.999
 insert me this is hunger 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.409
 and I'm going to take it to the end 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.550
 and today I'm going to start twisting 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.569
 in the rest of the hair I'm going to do 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.569
 like a chongo now the bandana 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.569
 very important 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.949
 I'm going to fold it this way 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.430
 and that like a triangle 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.110
 I'm going to download this part 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.270
 and now I'm going to put it 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.620
 and I'm going to make a small knot 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.870
 and well, that's how it is 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.550
 finally no makeup finished 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.500
 I hope you liked it is 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.300
 relatively easy I do not know why I 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.210
 it had taken so long to do this 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.190
 video is very easy independently 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.470
 if you want to do your hairstyle and 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.180
 with him for the cat hito and all that the 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.430
 makeup is very father is very father 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.740
 for the day if you omit the tabs 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.750
 false is perfect the delineated 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.360
 They are very charming and good for the 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.590
 lips red lips highlight 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.590
 the beauty of any woman
