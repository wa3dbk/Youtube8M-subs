00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.000
 just pack today there is one again 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.550
 new tour though a two-story 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.340
 flur spot you can see it already there 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.809
 I column something more stable 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.720
 I have some time I have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.920
 cut right back here 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.109
 then the whole plate in the cake 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 that young cream pies act 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.500
 i need something more stability and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.160
 take no straws and no 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.670
 and took me a strawberry cake 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 and above a pie with fruits 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.770
 I still have those two with one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.870
 Roulade decorated to make something modern 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 Act 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.809
 I always find this mandl ready 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 a little stale so i start downstairs 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.180
 already have strawberries to prove that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.039
 I cut myself how to get in 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.700
 background looks there I am doing 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.920
 first a small edge and then put 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 the others crazy about it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.939
 I think it does not have to be exact 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 it can also be aligned 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.439
 really be a little wild 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 then there lives a little more that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.689
 here is a pie for about 20 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.790
 people 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.470
 below I have a 24 diameter 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:42.869
 eight centimeters high and above an 18s 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:45.670
 diameter also at eight centimeters 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.869
 higher sorry so 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.040
 In order to prove I do it with fruits 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.830
 I first get a circle with plums 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 which would have as I look on it you can see it 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:06.310
 I run through this pie 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.679
 short time work filmed if you yes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 the pies used and the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.480
 has prepared then that is actually 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 no longer such a great effort the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.569
 to go out if he likes the recipes 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.319
 to the dead I can you gladly 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.500
 to deliver if the interest is there 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.799
 I'll do that I'll do it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.319
 also know how this video finds the 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.130
 I take it to work whether that too 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.709
 short are too long or if they are straight 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.480
 are good 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.450
 write me the comments if it you 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.890
 I like thumbs up or subscribed 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.500
 the channel if you want to see more 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.440
 now the kiwis have penetrated that i have 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.450
 I also cut flat 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 So I just do it around there 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.930
 the other 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.189
 and still am considering now a number 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:10.909
 dream run up there is still me 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.450
 then at the end two double hearts 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.719
 purely 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.599
 this open customer was desired 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.849
 was also a dead for a civilian 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.220
 I really like wedding 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.159
 original and very modern to me really 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.709
 very much fun now lose 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.310
 I still fruit with clear strokes 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.090
 who did not cook up and 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.349
 Now with the brush the fruits on the mushroom 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.040
 First, we have a nice one 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.310
 gloss and secondly , it is also one 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:49.239
 protection for the fruits they stay 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.239
 longer beautiful and better lakes longer 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.879
 above, I clearly land beats that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.190
 is called neutral finally and below 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.209
 I then paint the pie with me 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.209
 red mud 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.660
 he is still a little bit flavored with 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.450
 with strawberries you can see it here it is 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.790
 a little tricky there the strawberries oso 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.120
 thrown on it but by the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.900
 glaze then keep the fruits too 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.900
 better on it 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.300
 so 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.009
 finished studying and now I prove there 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.439
 a little more pistachios 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.169
 I would like a contrast more 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:45.520
 I'll have it in really good 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 that cows with the pistachio and the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.729
 red with the strawberries at the end 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.289
 I'll fix it a bit more if it does 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.490
 down a little snow somewhere 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.199
 gone is enough the way today can 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.939
 I really do not speak German so well 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.020
 I do not know what to do with me 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.409
 is in the reason already now I would still 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.900
 the double heart is a so 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.990
 I say goodbye to this video 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.219
 until next time your marcel von 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.219
 just bake
