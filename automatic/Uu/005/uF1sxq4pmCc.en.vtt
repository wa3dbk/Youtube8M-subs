00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this tutorial is going to show you how

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.090 
this tutorial is going to show you how
to<00:00:03.000> make<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.600> right-leaning<00:00:04.140> rectangle<00:00:04.890> off

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
to make a right-leaning rectangle off

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.369 
to make a right-leaning rectangle off
the<00:00:05.339> base<00:00:05.580> triangle<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.810> piece<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.020> entre

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
the base triangle and a piece of entre

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.100 
the base triangle and a piece of entre
lock<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> begin<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
lock now to begin with I just have the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.249 
lock now to begin with I just have the
sample<00:00:10.559> piece<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.330> I've<00:00:12.330> made<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> few<00:00:12.960> base

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
sample piece and I've made a few base

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
sample piece and I've made a few base
triangles<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.610> worked<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
triangles and I worked that from the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.870 
triangles and I worked that from the
right<00:00:15.570> side<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> fabric<00:00:16.100> now<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:17.609> in

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
right side of the fabric now because in

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.790 
right side of the fabric now because in
the<00:00:18.029> pattern<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.600> we're<00:00:18.810> talking<00:00:19.410> about

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the pattern that we're talking about

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.170 
the pattern that we're talking about
we're<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.340> circularly<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
we're going to do this circularly you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.570 
we're going to do this circularly you
would<00:00:21.330> break<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.720> yarn<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> then<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.369> would

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
would break your yarn and then you would

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
would break your yarn and then you would
turn<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> work<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> insides<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> purl

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
turn the work to the insides of the purl

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.160 
turn the work to the insides of the purl
side<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.830> facing<00:00:26.330> let's<00:00:27.330> analyze<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
side is facing let's analyze it just a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.390 
side is facing let's analyze it just a
little<00:00:28.199> bit<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.710> we're<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> pick

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
little bit because we're going to pick

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.900 
little bit because we're going to pick
up<00:00:29.779> along<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.019> sloping<00:00:31.529> edge<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> if

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
up along this sloping edge here and if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
up along this sloping edge here and if
you<00:00:33.059> look<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.800> chain

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you look and see there are these chain

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
you look and see there are these chain
stitches<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.180> you're<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> come<00:00:37.170> under

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
stitches and you're going to come under

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
stitches and you're going to come under
both<00:00:37.890> legs<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> stitch<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> right

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
both legs of the stitch with the right

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
both legs of the stitch with the right
hand<00:00:40.140> needle<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> begin<00:00:43.070> I'm<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
hand needle so to begin I'm going to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.639 
hand needle so to begin I'm going to
take<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.000> hand<00:00:45.239> needle<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> come

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
take my right hand needle and come

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400 
take my right hand needle and come
underneath<00:00:47.160> both<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.210> those<00:00:48.360> legs<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:49.140> back

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
underneath both of those legs from back

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
underneath both of those legs from back
to<00:00:49.710> front<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.430> picking<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:51.559> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to front because we're picking up on the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.840 
to front because we're picking up on the
purl<00:00:52.920> side<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.890> let's<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.219> other<00:00:56.430> color

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
purl side and let's get our other color

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
purl side and let's get our other color
that<00:00:57.059> we're<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> join<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.020> because

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that we're going to join in here because

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.430 
that we're going to join in here because
typically<00:00:58.590> you'll<00:00:58.829> change<00:00:59.160> color<00:00:59.460> every<00:00:59.760> tier

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
typically you'll change color every tier

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
typically you'll change color every tier
when<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:01.559> working<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.010> entre<00:01:02.460> lock<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
when you're working this entre lock so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
when you're working this entre lock so
I'm<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> make<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> loop<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.369> then

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I'm just going to make a loop and then

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
I'm just going to make a loop and then
pull<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.060> through<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> create<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> stitch

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
pull that through to create a stitch

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
pull that through to create a stitch
there's<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> come<00:01:08.909> underneath

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
there's one I'm going to come underneath

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.530 
there's one I'm going to come underneath
the<00:01:09.689> next<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.260> both<00:01:10.530> legs<00:01:11.270> from<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the next one both legs from back to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
the next one both legs from back to
front<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> find<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.450> yarn<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.610> yarn<00:01:17.610> around

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
front you find my yarn here yarn around

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.780 
front you find my yarn here yarn around
and<00:01:18.560> pull<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.740> through<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.490> using

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and pull that through and I'm just using

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
and pull that through and I'm just using
because<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.119> picking<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.420> stitches<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.900> just

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
because I'm picking up stitches I'm just

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.710 
because I'm picking up stitches I'm just
using<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.470> needle<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.610> fingers<00:01:24.000> here's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
using one needle and my fingers here's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.700 
using one needle and my fingers here's
the<00:01:24.930> third<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.759> both<00:01:26.810> strands<00:01:28.100> yarn<00:01:29.100> around

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
the third one both strands yarn around

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.080 
the third one both strands yarn around
now<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.130> down<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> toward<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
now when you get down to the toward the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
now when you get down to the toward the
bottom<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> stitches<00:01:34.860> tend<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.400> smaller

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
bottom the stitches tend to get smaller

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
bottom the stitches tend to get smaller
because<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.659> tension<00:01:36.930> placed<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.619> them

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
because there's tension placed on them

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550 
because there's tension placed on them
so<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:39.180> might<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> tug<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.049> them<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so you might have to tug on them just a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
so you might have to tug on them just a
little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.549> them<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
little bit to get them going now in the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
little bit to get them going now in the
first<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> first

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
first one that you do in the first

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
first one that you do in the first
rectangle<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> pick<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.140> oftentimes

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
rectangle that you pick up oftentimes

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.149 
rectangle that you pick up oftentimes
there<00:01:47.610> aren't<00:01:47.939> enough<00:01:48.619> obvious<00:01:49.619> places<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
there aren't enough obvious places to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.590 
there aren't enough obvious places to
pick<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.729> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> create

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
pick up so you kind of have to create

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.350 
pick up so you kind of have to create
one<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> bottom<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:53.970> I'm

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and then I'm going to purl two together

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.440 
and then I'm going to purl two together
one<00:03:41.010> from<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.700> side<00:03:41.909> and<00:03:41.939> one<00:03:42.239> from<00:03:42.389> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
one from this side and one from that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.759 
one from this side and one from that
side<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.780> typically<00:03:43.200> they're<00:03:43.469> two<00:03:43.590> different

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
side and typically they're two different

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.490 
side and typically they're two different
colors<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:45.569> hard<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> tell<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.349> one

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
colors it's hard to tell on this one

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.050 
colors it's hard to tell on this one
because<00:03:46.590> they're<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:46.950> similar<00:03:47.219> then<00:03:47.730> you'll

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
because they're so similar then you'll

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.399 
because they're so similar then you'll
turn<00:03:48.419> and<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:50.370> will<00:03:50.959> knit<00:03:51.959> back<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.900> actually

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
turn and you will knit back and actually

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.940 
turn and you will knit back and actually
