Welcome to Andis Tutorials

00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:05.902
My tutorials are specially designed for iClone 6!

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:10.332
Today is the first topic

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.900
the tracker camera

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.000
which was present in all versions and iClone is!

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:19.052
Unfortunately, this feature is not available in iClone 6!

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:25.000
First we need an Avatar! Let's take the Heidi!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:47.000
Now we create first a walking motion

00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:09.000
Next, we need a camera

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:25.000
now we have to link the camera with the avatar

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:34.000
Now we play it all the more times now and we have to admit that the result is not what we expected!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Since the background as an earthquake shakes and that's what we want to prevent

00:01:44.518 --> 00:01:59.000
Plus we go back to linkage and open the window "Link to Sub-Node", where you can select the individual body parts

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:13.300
and now here we choose the body part rodenode (0), so the camera is linked with it

00:03:49.196 --> 00:04:06.000
End of my first tutorial! Bye Bye
