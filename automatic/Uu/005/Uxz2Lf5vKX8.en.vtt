on a journey but that's the important

on a journey but that's the important
part<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.570> take<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.020> first<00:02:55.290> step<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
part is to take that first step to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.650 
part is to take that first step to
introduce<00:02:56.190> those<00:02:56.370> technologies<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.330> then<00:02:57.540> we

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
introduce those technologies and then we

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.120 
introduce those technologies and then we
become<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.959> consideration<00:02:58.590> among<00:02:58.980> those

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
become a consideration among those

ourselves in the market right we we

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940 
ourselves in the market right we we
don't<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.570> strong<00:03:04.080> brand<00:03:04.410> image<00:03:04.620> that

don't have that strong brand image that
some<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.310> others<00:03:05.550> enjoy<00:03:05.970> some<00:03:06.330> people
