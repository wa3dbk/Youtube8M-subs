00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.620
 the boys and girls 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 today is already Wednesday and is the day of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.940
 week that I chose to open more 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.920
 packs of silly disney and then 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 show you how it 's getting to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.830
 my collection 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 in the last video last Wednesday 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 I opened five parcels and these 53 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 were unreleased in my collection and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 only two were repeated 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 So let's see if this Wednesday I 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 I'll be luckier and we'll see if 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 you will give me more luck because the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.840
 time - repeating many more goals 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 So let's start with the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 first slaughter 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 I already arrived here and now I will open 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.980
 I'll start by showing the cards and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 these four cards came here 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:01:01.460
 just an Internet already has and also Auire 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 these two here can not really identify 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 right because they are part of some 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:14.700
 scenario the first goal today is a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 Thor's tie I'm already 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:25.670
 I have repeated but in fact and at least 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.020
 least three of them because the film 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.850
 13 appear 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 I think this history is very cool. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.729
 obtained at least plus or no 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:46.079
 I'm going to change, and now in the next 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:49.500
 planting today is already included 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.850
 A shit is here, little feet. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 are very cool too. 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.930
 half a mick and I have another 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.270
 half of it was a girl that heart 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.030
 I have not collected an album here but I have 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 here and the smell is the case of alice in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.750
 Wonderland also had no 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.899
 this figurine and let's see what the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.349
 globe 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.349
 I do not have 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.489
 blue flame arrived his name is the villain of the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.849
 I still did not have much legal body 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.549
 so I already opened 2 within those 21 is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.269
 repeated and another is unprecedented and 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:37.590
 tied we go to the next pack of 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:42.750
 today singing and dancing 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.700
 Cards came to Michael House from the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 movie monsters s / a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.510
 came a measurement that I already have a cap 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.200
 p1 spark that I have it inclusive 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:08.549
 repeating on go came another and only rockstar 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:15.269
 that in another scene of the movie toy story and 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.709
 I forgot his name now I already have 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.410
 repeated 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.590
 so I 've seen three packs today 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.109
 of these 32 in the retreat are only on average 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.010
 let's go to the next pope had trained 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:34.879
 are here are harder to open 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.879
 other not 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.260
 and starting with the figurines the cat 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.729
 charles of alice in wonderland 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.639
 but in another 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:48.060
 in another version in the version of go 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:04:01.560
 I still did not have it, I think there's a 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:04:04.769
 piece of some cool character scene 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.750
 still did not have this character is the 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.579
 rabbit from movie alice in the country of 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.909
 very cool wonders 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.430
 so let's remember now open 4 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.820
 the packets of these 42 are 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.850
 unpublished and two are repeated 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.540
 Let's go to the next package today. 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.520
 who is here we see the latter with 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.370
 a bertin sa repeated by an unprecedented 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.290
 starting with the figurines came the pascal 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.650
 that I already have him 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.810
 card and also a goal repeated until 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.940
 ee odom carlton of carlton said that 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.870
 I still did not have a card and neither goal 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.120
 also has not here half also 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.900

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.900
 I already really want to have a single bo 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.050

 Magician I do not know how I can whoever I am 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.070

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.010
 this very nice goal and did not have to 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.180
 I was very happy and wanted to sleep very much. 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.830
 this globe 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.530

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.470

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.050
 The truth was only repeating because another 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.940
 thesis of toy story 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.490
 if I win yet another repeat of it 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.960
 I will not be mad at a dog that I like 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.780
