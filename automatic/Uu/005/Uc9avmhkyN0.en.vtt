pianist<00:01:16.740> yeah<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.369> three<00:01:17.670> sensors<00:01:18.060> means<00:01:19.009> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pianist yeah so three sensors means that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.640 
pianist yeah so three sensors means that
the<00:01:20.130> repetitions<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the repetitions are more they have a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
the repetitions are more they have a
much<00:01:23.100> better<00:01:23.280> precision<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.570> yeah<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
much better precision well yeah of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.890 
much better precision well yeah of
course<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:26.189> three<00:01:26.400> sensor<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> gives<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
course the three sensor is gives the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
course the three sensor is gives the
opportunity<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:30.420> high<00:01:30.540> speed

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
opportunity to get a very high speed

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280 
opportunity to get a very high speed
repetition<00:01:31.729> even<00:01:32.729> even<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> middle

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
repetition even even if in the middle

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.280 
repetition even even if in the middle
key<00:01:34.439> positions<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.119> even<00:01:37.110> more

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
key positions but the even more

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
key positions but the even more
important<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> key<00:01:38.520> lengths<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
important thing is the key lengths you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260 
important thing is the key lengths you
know<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.290> has<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.860> killings<00:01:41.270> from

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
know this one has the killings from

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.789 
know this one has the killings from
balance<00:01:42.689> pin<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> front<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> keys<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
