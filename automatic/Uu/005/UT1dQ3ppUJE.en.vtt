00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
some way in the book and so it took a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
some way in the book and so it took a

everybody in there of all the characters
in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> game<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> am

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
in the game I think the two that I am
most<00:01:34.020> looking<00:01:34.229> forward<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.799> seeing<00:01:35.189> face<00:01:35.490> off

okay<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.420> think<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.990> thematically<00:01:38.800> those<00:01:39.250> two

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
okay I think that thematically those two

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.280 
okay I think that thematically those two
characters<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> lot<00:01:40.300> more<00:01:40.600> common<00:01:41.080> than

characters have a lot more common than

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.800 
characters have a lot more common than
they<00:01:41.500> do<00:01:41.560> at<00:01:42.040> first<00:01:42.460> glance<00:01:42.730> in<00:01:43.420> terms<00:01:43.720> of
