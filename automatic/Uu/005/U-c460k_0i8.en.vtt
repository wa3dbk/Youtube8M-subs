00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.810
 healthy everyone is lex moment and today i 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.269
 would like to talk about server creation 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.860
 Yes, I created a server 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.960
 now it is already played by people like me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 fit and in the VKontakte group already wrote 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.550
 his existence and invite everyone 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 rest on him 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 why it is necessary to go to the sea ​​and not to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 whose other well for starters I certainly 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.270
 I will tell about plug-ins that is on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.239
 server about its capabilities but second to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.879
 the server will play me and my friends 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.309
 friends we'll probably shoot something 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.930
 can you get in frame can you even 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 take part of some of his not those who 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 we will shoot well I do not know what's here 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 will be but here of course I will play on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 Servo 70 slot background works around the clock 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 is on the hosting and installed on it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 it's a lot of interesting stuff 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.090
 many more will be installed 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.870
 interesting how do you see the span 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 enough so well, albeit small 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.320
 simple but nevertheless cozy such 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.290
 Well, I think it is built in the desert 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 so that players have more space for 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.740
 expanse players leaves deserted biomes 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 for example and here where the jungle are built 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.180
 swamp 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.180
 something like that we decided to do here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.440
 to about 100 at the thought not very much 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.730
 what was before the house then everyones so but not 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.650
 the essence is not the essence now I'll tell you 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.420
 a bit about the fact that if the series is first on 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.000
 which is worth paying attention of course 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.910
 there are necessary commands that is what I mean 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.140
 i say understandable spawn i am so primitive 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.820
 tell you will not call there 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.680
 list the names of the plugin which 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.090
 always roll span that is you stupidly live 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 on the spawn then there is the command set home yes 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.900
 this plugin in social plugin is sweet 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.170
 home yes that is, you can put all the houses 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.170
 by them well porters understandable i think 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 everyone had experience with such a team there 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.710
 here 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 economy and shop shop themselves in general 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.710
 in fact there is no material that is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 opportunity to create them 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:26.040
 vipov webcam, I gave a few people 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.690
 Of course my friends and friends 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.670
 sex guy and a couple people for active 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.430
 channel activity there even there 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 gave of course to one person and so simple 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 so then the activity is clear but he 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.480
 let's say it wasn’t my total 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.400
 acquaintances or I gave him vip because he 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.750
 often left a comment i remember on 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.750
 channel here 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.640
 but the problem is that he then started 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.710
 generally hard to beg and I'm with him 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.330
 and took a webcam and 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:09.790
 and gave the lock chateau but are not so 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:13.030
 here is the economy for example here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.930
 work yes that is, you can get on 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.240
 work here enter jobs and shows 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:25.630
 help for plugin jobs list enter yes 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:31.480
 no where it was here right now a minute but 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:35.860
 bro yes there is a profession woodcutter miner 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.640
 builder digger and farmer Jobs example 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.450
 jo in meiner im hiring 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:50.920
 Teremu received loot for example 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:52.480
 destroy the stone former balance or in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.750
 I do not remember creativity 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.209
 exactly in general of each of the professions 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.299
 Well, they have been assigned such blocks for which 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.250
 do not get money in the era of gold 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.250
 supply need not be too personal 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.660
 No, apparently everything is fixed, I just sat 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.299
 and only on the old version of the plague again 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.310
 well off the topic in general will block and 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.160
 to me they give you money for example 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.780
 if you are a woodcutter, they give you money too 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.450
 if you cut down sit they all 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.100
 rub around nothing like these 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.070
 by the way on the spawn floor is connected as well 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.380
 in general she is in love 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.940
 here's what else is on the server of course 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.260
 you can transfer money to build some 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.770
 shop we later on spawn 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.870
 of course we will open a slot for stores 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.720
 that the type of that type will be able to create 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.300
 regular trades in these table stores 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.790
 I'll probably make such mini later 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.450
 gaydick and then because how to survive on 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.090
 server 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.750
 as an example of the nature of the territory and their 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.670
 much more on the server 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.640
 of course there is private I will not give you 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.530
 tell how to privatize territory 70 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.770
 thousand blocks become private and in my opinion 2 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.380
 dash 2 region opportunity privat even 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.360
 chests can be interrupted when they are 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.150
 will put they will automatically turn 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.730
 but again I think you are with this 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.680
 faced by the way the team in private 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.100
 door for example the hatch here is this but without 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.160
 point to private point then click 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.240
 Well, in general, everything is clear and I think so 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.000
 you private plates of course we are Mrs 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:36.400
 by the way the rules are specified 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.630
 Here are the server groups and everything for such 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.820
 basic information we will still 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.160
 only today only 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.430
 literally an hour ago we are somewhere all this but 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.880
 let's say post built to the end all 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:55.060
 I filed and in general opened the server 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:59.830
 so I 'm waiting here in general, I think 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:03.070
 all yes and good luck everyone thanks for watching 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.940
 wait for new issues cashier bad guys 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:10.870
 soon i will define data even then she 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.980
 will be saturday i think so in 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.910
 at 5-6 o'clock I was still undecided 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.120
 that is, the bad guys used to be like this before 3 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.070
 will not be this series I will also put 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.340
 The other plug here is really 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.380
 there are a lot of 29 plug-ins, it is clear that throughout 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:38.770
 I didn’t rank all of them because 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:39.640
 long well here for example this foul sound then 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.300
 there is an opportunity to do 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:48.010
 Various tabular bridges if anyone knows 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.290
 about it and so on sorry here plays 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:54.390
