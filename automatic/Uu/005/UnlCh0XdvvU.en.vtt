00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.710
 What is the differential of the price of the fat ox? 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.929
 and cow in thick bush 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.490
 today the price differential between 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.359
 arroba of the fat ox the price of the cow 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.160
 fat in the state is 10.3 percent 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.100
 this is a larger differential than the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.170
 historical average of 9.4 percent 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 which proves that the prices of the same cow 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 appreciating in the comparison of April with 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 March and still it is still more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.700
 value than the historical average of the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.640
 that normal is for this category of the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.219
 and what explains this increase in 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 case of the cow is the increase in the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.230
 cow is an increase as he already commented 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.730
 in previous bulletins, not the demand 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.500
 external demand 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 This is what we have exported in this 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
 first quarter is very high 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.719
 a very large demand with the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 own messi 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.230
 this has taken the price in a general way 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.160
 in live cattle and cow market does not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 was different 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 the one that is the factor that has improved the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.979
 Cow price is that the valuation was 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 greater in reality then while the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 values ​​1.65 per cent it is a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 variation is relative to cow goes 1.9 per 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.920
 one hundred she left a price there of 77 68 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.600
 to 79 and 16 while the ox came out of 85 and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 89 to 87 16 also the price of at 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.100
 this full harvest 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.700
 scenario could be different if 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.920
 if the demand is for sure would be if the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.329
 demand was not greater than this demand 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 was smaller 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.170
 and we could have lower prices 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 also in the nassau 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 we are not at the beginning of the harvest 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 harvest really did not reach us 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.479
 Do you know how much ox is coming out? 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 now until May what will it be when 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.770
 it arrives at the peak of the same harvest 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.409
 so we have to go analyzing with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 calmer but probably if we do not 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 if we had this external demand 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.259
 we could have pre are living prices 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.600
 the available market of the ox 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.099
 because of the foreign market that is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.179
 the main buyer of meat 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.310
 mato-grossense 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.380
 today we see consolidating with 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.890
 our one of our main ours 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.250
 principal trading partner in the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.099
 the Venezuelan beef market and in the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.270
 first quarter is we checked 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.950
 an increase of 122% in volume so that the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.989
 brazil that is what mato grosso exported 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.880
 to venezuela but it was a moment 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.040
 Overall, it was not just Venezuela that people 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.860
 had an increase of almost 60 percent 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.500
 for the European Union also more than 50 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.880
 percent to 1 kong china that the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.310
 outflow goes to a van after 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.769
 enters China so generally the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.830
 exports were very good and this 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.989
 sure this demand has been keeping 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.940
 price support and even taking 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.099
 Like where did you end up commenting? 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.590
 to know if this demand will continue 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.650
 not heated we have no way to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.299
 even a new prognosis because the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.580
 export data we checked 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.870
 which are weekly they talk about meat of the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.549
 In general, then we do not have 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.310
 talking about beef is increasing 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.299
 the demand for beef but it is 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.269
 fact that if it continues in this same 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.950
 threshold of external demand we can 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.280
 we can verify higher prices 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.359
 now in even more and the harvest 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.359
 higher than in the offseason
