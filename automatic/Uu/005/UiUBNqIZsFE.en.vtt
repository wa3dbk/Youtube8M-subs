00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.560
 after i posted the video like 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.960
 turn off unnecessary applications 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.069
 android 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.069
 4 0 length droid 4 1 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.999
 some people 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.460
 asked me to tell you more tom 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 how to remove system sentences 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.579
 Well, I'll start with the fact that 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.679
 to remove system applications 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.529
 we will surely demand a rub 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.919
 if you turn off unnecessary applications 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.249
 we can without a friend 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.249
 that is, you can't do without it 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 on your smartphone already hold rub rights 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.740
 we still need applications titanium 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 until 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.680
 thereafter 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.340
 we go press the backup button 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.600
 copies 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.310
 and see here 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.200
 all applications are installed 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
 but our smartphone 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.330
 red marked 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.800
 those that the system 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 the ones we want to delete 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 let's get a look 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 which application 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 you can delete here for example 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 we will do this procedure by example 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 hour applications he 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 The application is getting out of me 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.040
 here there is a convert to 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.370
 favor custom 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 attachment 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 and also probably should be removed 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 for removing 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.150
 short enough yes 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.630
 really 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.410
 As you can see 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.660
 there is a button 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.790
 the application itself 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 also remove dan 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 press the delete button 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160
 he says we don't have a backup 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.749
 by the way delete 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.139
 afk systems and applications need 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.989
 very consciously that is 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.180
 You should know what applications you can 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.099
 delete 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.789
 and which 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.449
 players can not be so 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 this removal will begin problems 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 I deleted the application typo 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:30.939
 now sane 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.939
 there is no smartphone 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.869
 you can also 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.559
 at first 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.889
 convert system application 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:42.759
 uses 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.759
 these 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.359
 conflict area 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.489
 what systems 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.959
 these terms I press the convert button 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.959
 in user application 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.029
 I understand what's going on 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.259
 copying 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.259
 this application 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.010
 this purchase of houses is usually set 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.369
 sentences as we see now 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.369
 attachment 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.529
 the robot are not red marked 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.109
 white as usual applications 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.889
 after that it can be removed 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.779
 even the application menu 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.779
 but this is for ships 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.839
 the position has been removed from the smartphone 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.539
 as you see nothing complicated about it 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.899
 only 5 same again 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.319
 before deleting 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.759
 you should know what can be removed and what 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.679
 can't 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.189
 also if in doubt stock 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.219
 first do the same katanin bye 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.489
 there 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.049
 backup copies of all system applications 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.279
 and then selectively delete 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.209
 which you see fit 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.599
 if suddenly somewhere wrong 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 bulls recovered 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.919
 nothing complicated 5 h 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.499
 Thank you for your attention so far.
