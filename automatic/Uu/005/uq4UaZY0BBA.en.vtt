00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
brawl so letting players edit their

customizable<00:01:03.899> feature<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
customizable feature I think would be

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
customizable feature I think would be
appropriate<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.760> alternate<00:01:06.240> aesthetic

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
appropriate would be alternate aesthetic

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.210 
appropriate would be alternate aesthetic
changes<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.350> other<00:01:07.560> games<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.040> other

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
characters series so long as these

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
characters series so long as these
changes<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:11.010> affect<00:01:11.340> gameplay<00:01:11.490> movesets

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.440 
changes don't affect gameplay movesets
it<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.689> keep<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.290> more<00:01:13.500> balanced

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
it can keep the game much more balanced

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.850 
it can keep the game much more balanced
now<00:01:15.450> keep<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.780> mind<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.049> soccer<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.439> said<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
game but we can't say for sure if he was

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
game but we can't say for sure if he was
talking<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.740> characters<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.520> he<00:01:24.150> could

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
talking about characters or not he could

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
talking about characters or not he could
been<00:01:24.420> talking<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.720> stages<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.619> game<00:01:26.040> modes

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
been talking about stages or game modes

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
been talking about stages or game modes
or<00:01:26.670> whatever

or whatever

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600 
or whatever
although<00:01:28.259> adding<00:01:28.619> customizable<00:01:29.220> characters

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
although adding customizable characters

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.149 
although adding customizable characters
would<00:01:30.000> seem<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> logical<00:01:30.930> approach<00:01:31.200> one

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
would seem like a logical approach one

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
would seem like a logical approach one

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.840 
specific to the profile being used now I
think<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.830> major<00:03:50.100> thing<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.700> to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
think the major thing we have to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.640 
think the major thing we have to
remember<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.140> first<00:03:52.380> time

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
remember is that for the first time

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.320 
remember is that for the first time
we're<00:03:53.010> gonna<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.340> two<00:03:53.640> versions<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330

we're gonna have two versions of the
game<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.020> 3ds<00:03:55.410> version<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> Wii<00:03:56.400> U

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
game the 3ds version and the Wii U

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.760 
game the 3ds version and the Wii U
version<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.780> opens<00:03:58.110> up<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.290> lot<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.530> new

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
version that opens up a lot of new

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.949 
version that opens up a lot of new
opportunities<00:03:58.950> for<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> game<00:04:00.000> should<00:04:00.750> we<00:04:00.840> get

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
opportunities for the game should we get

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.810 
opportunities for the game should we get
customizable<00:04:01.620> characters<00:04:02.010> for<00:04:02.340> only<00:04:02.520> one

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
customizable characters for only one

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.840 
customizable characters for only one
version<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.450> would<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.750> even<00:04:03.959> make<00:04:04.200> sense

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
version or would that even make sense

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.100 
version or would that even make sense
now<00:04:05.850> there's<00:04:06.030> one<00:04:06.209> more<00:04:06.239> hints<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.959> get

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
now there's one more hints we can get

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.360 
now there's one more hints we can get
from<00:04:07.290> Smash<00:04:07.530> Bros<00:04:07.770> as<00:04:07.920> possible

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
from Smash Bros as possible

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.370 
from Smash Bros as possible
customization<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.270> that's<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:09.959> Kid<00:04:10.200> Icarus

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
customization and that's from Kid Icarus

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.800 
customization and that's from Kid Icarus
Uprising<00:04:11.270> although<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.420> wasn't<00:04:12.570> exactly

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
Uprising although it wasn't exactly

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
Uprising although it wasn't exactly
characters<00:04:13.650> Kid<00:04:14.310> Icarus<00:04:14.430> had<00:04:14.790> some<00:04:14.940> pretty

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
characters Kid Icarus had some pretty

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.270 
characters Kid Icarus had some pretty
deep<00:04:15.420> weapons<00:04:15.810> customization<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:17.130> could

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
deep weapons customization and you could

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.039 
deep weapons customization and you could
see<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.640> based<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.150> gameplay<00:04:18.570> there

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
see that based on the gameplay there

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.870 
see that based on the gameplay there
were<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.230> lot<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.530> ideas<00:04:19.770> taken<00:04:20.400> from<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.669> Smash

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
were a lot of ideas taken from the Smash

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.240 
were a lot of ideas taken from the Smash
Bros<00:04:21.150> series<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:22.169> example<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.979> daybreak

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
Bros series for example the daybreak

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.400 
Bros series for example the daybreak
powerup<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.030> surprisingly<00:04:24.630> similar<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
powerup is surprisingly similar to the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.480 
powerup is surprisingly similar to the
Dragoon<00:04:25.890> item

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
Dragoon item

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.520 
Dragoon item
all<00:04:26.610> basically<00:04:27.569> if<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.870> collect<00:04:28.169> all<00:04:28.380> three

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
all basically if you collect all three

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.700 
all basically if you collect all three
parts<00:04:28.949> you're<00:04:29.460> almost<00:04:29.580> guaranteed<00:04:29.910> ação

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
parts you're almost guaranteed ação

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.809 
parts you're almost guaranteed ação
since<00:04:31.710> both<00:04:31.889> of<00:04:31.919> these<00:04:32.160> games<00:04:32.370> were<00:04:32.610> developed

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
since both of these games were developed

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.089 
since both of these games were developed
so<00:04:33.270> closely<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.900> each<00:04:33.930> other<00:04:34.349> it<00:04:34.440> won't<00:04:35.009> be

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
so closely to each other it won't be

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.140 
so closely to each other it won't be
surprising<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.699> some<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.030> these

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
surprising that some of these

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.029 
surprising that some of these
customization<00:04:37.020> ideas<00:04:37.380> would<00:04:37.620> be<00:04:37.650> carried

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
customization ideas would be carried

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.240 
customization ideas would be carried
over<00:04:38.190> at<00:04:38.729> least<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.449> 3ds<00:04:39.810> version<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
over at least for the 3ds version the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.580 
over at least for the 3ds version the
way<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.400> see<00:04:41.759> it<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:42.300> 3ds<00:04:42.690> version<00:04:42.840> should<00:04:43.470> be

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
way I see it the 3ds version should be

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.620 
way I see it the 3ds version should be
the<00:04:43.740> testing<00:04:44.099> ground<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.520> new<00:04:44.669> ideas<00:04:44.849> while

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
the testing ground for new ideas while

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.420 
the testing ground for new ideas while
the<00:04:45.750> Wii<00:04:45.930> U<00:04:46.139> version<00:04:46.410> would<00:04:46.949> stick<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.250> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
the Wii U version would stick to the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.550 
the Wii U version would stick to the
more<00:04:47.580> traditional<00:04:48.120> style<00:04:48.240> at<00:04:49.110> this<00:04:49.319> point

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
more traditional style at this point

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.890 
more traditional style at this point
almost<00:04:49.919> anything<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.520> possible<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:51.569> we're

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
almost anything is possible so we're

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.980 
almost anything is possible so we're
just<00:04:51.930> gonna<00:04:52.169> have<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.410> wait<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.740> find<00:04:52.800> out

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
just gonna have to wait and find out

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.689 
just gonna have to wait and find out
anyway<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.889> next<00:04:56.039> question<00:04:56.490> should
