00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.719
 good friends we are one more day here in 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.730
 the counselor section when answering 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.210
 where are we going to answer with simple 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.010
 notes questions 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.870
 and good thing has one thing is that you are not 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.610
 happy with nothing 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.050
 if he signed up really hard because he 's very 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.280
 strong if it's like a beginner 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.020
 because he is not prepared to 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.700
 compete but look at one thing always what 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.900
 I said when someone comes to 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.440
 ask for help to do a preparation 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.870
 physical 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.340
 I do not notice his physique, I do not fix his 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.170
 potential I do not notice anything at all 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.990
 world has the right to enjoy the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.270
 sport to its maximum exponent than its 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.100
 body is able to give if I had 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.620
 to select people and nothing else 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.720
 that prepare champions or people with a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 genetic predisposition to be a champion 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.700
 the others would not enjoy and all 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.530
 we are entitled to enjoy the sport 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.660
 then to be the high competitions 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 level competitions of less level of 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 beginner competitions that is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 where will this boy who would be in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.190
 the video but of course it is not ready 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 to compete if at your level 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.900
 and of course we each play in a league 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 different also in football there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.140
 first second third and I do not know how many 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870
 divisions plus regional logos I do not know 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.310
 what then this is the same thing happens to me that 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.350
 you have to lend a hand to everyone who 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.909
 who needs it if we can not 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.260
 base nothing more than champions because 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.310
 then sport would not be a sport 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 so that I enjoy it as all are worth 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.240
 let's start good I get older and I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.490
 I have to put the fa v I do not want 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 messing up the topic development here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330
 We put the friend in liberty play says 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 only two weeks this routine 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.260
 toni clarified of your next video 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.909
 let's see we are doing that exercise of 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.869
 Approach to perfect training 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.159
 I'm giving you clear I'm staying 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.420
 little by little because if you have all 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.710
 information once we run out 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.880
 story and we are here to make a 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.039
 program where you have to enjoy it 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.469
 not then that we have done the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.509
 Six of six training 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.880
 now it's warming four of 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.670
 eight we have already finished all the groups 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.840
 muscles and if I advise you to go 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.369
 doing two weeks each training 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.259
 and every time we will do better 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.719
 I already know that you want more 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.039
 speed of information but of course 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.700
 things have to be done gradually but 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.979
 the producer cuts our necks 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.290
 we will start and the next videos will be 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.819
 with the integers of 4 of 10 and so we will do 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.170
 successively until we get to 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.420
 all the applications we have 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.590
 well here we have a question from 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.950
 our friend are already st portocarrero 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.360
 carrero mz vale says one thing this is 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.050
 must do twice a week or 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.340
 gloves is indicated and what weight that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.270
 weighs to tone and give good we go to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.510
 watch 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
 as you are watching we always do 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.460
 although they are the trainings of 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.420
 Approach for perfect training 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.890
 the position or order of the exercises 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.330
 will always be of the sale system 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 then the perfect man 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.540
 we will understand once we have agreed 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.710
 we have done it more or less or not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.480
 we have made it come we always do 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.660
 chest Tuesday back to Wednesday 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.940
 legs Thursday, shoulder and Friday 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.530
 arm then we obviously do 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.740
 shoulder on Thursdays that would be only 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.840
 one week worth we will continue 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.910
 let's put or for another our friend chop 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.500
 angel tells us hello toni wanted 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.030
 ask about the back of the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.040
 shoulder I'm a little behind 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.170
 with respect to the front and side 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.330
 you can do several exercises for that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.690
 part of the same section we can 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.150
 I would overload a lot of small muscle 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.070
 the truth is that we are doing the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.980
 Approach and conform exercises 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.650
 let's see, let's go closer to the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 perfect training you will see that 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.520
 we will increase the work in the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.740
 three - headed man separately 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.850
 they can do more yes but neither do they alone 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.200
 on trains that already know what is not 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.760
 only a small muscle will stay 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.920
 many series trains the same as 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.410
 other parts but try to try 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.580
 Concentrate more the movement and feel it 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.570
 just in the later the person 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.460
 that we have with trained a little 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.170
 outside is that many times we imply 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.550
 too much back and if it carries more 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.780
 I work the back of the man later 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.190
 why the very later 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.090
 you will notice jce less progress and try 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.740
 truly isolate the shoulder 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 later and if it can be a very trick 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.090
 good that is done when a muscle does not 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.530
 you have a work feeling is that 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.910
 the partner puts your hand on top of 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.260
 that muscle and you when you're doing 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.120
 the repetitions you notice that you're 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.709
 working that part of the body of 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.240
 agreement I hope you served 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.549
 to follow 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000
 well let's go for another 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.680
 j suÃ¡rez 113 tells us good tony like 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.060
 always always between the same is to say 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 between multiplied both in volume 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.540
 as in definition thank you very much 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.430
 the truth that if then until good and 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.690
 what happens yes it is true that 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.130
 we change the training when it comes 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.350
 the competition and I will make you one 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.870
 explanation a long explanation for 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.430
 that on this subject but if always 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.810
 I always train in some way because 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.490
 because he thinks I always want to give him 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.690
 the three of making possibility of 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.310
 muscle growth is that we have 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.440
 which is the work of the three types of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660
 fibers that we have not then always 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.760
 I do it the same as what happens when I 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.350
 about competition must be lower 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.600
 jobs with an application because 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.650
 further ahead but usually if 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.850
 there is this will always be about three or 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.590
 four or six weeks before the 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.240
 competition but usually always 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.490
 always always the trainings were 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.710
 just as good we will continue 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.110
 Here we have another question from our 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.669
 friend raul the killer says hello toni me 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.169
 I would like to know if I can take volume and 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.210
 strength at the same time I would like me to 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.479
 explain that thanks 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.550
 with the truth yes because if you take 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.319
 volume you take strength and according to 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.580
 training that you are doing the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.830
 truth is that multi training 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.199
 fibers is a training that you have to catch 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.970
 a lot of strength and at the same time very much 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.410
 volume because we could be working 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.180
 the three types of fibers both the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.370
 strength like the muscle-sized 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.220
 then yes it is true that you will collect 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.900
 both strength and volume 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.250
 the way to check what you put 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.530
 to do this training during a 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.380
 season two or three weeks not a month and 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.730
 then do a maximum repetition of 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.800
 a certain muscle group according 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.410
 you're a month training this system 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.240
 and then you can do 'an rm you will see 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.710
 that strength has increased tremendously and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.330
 thanks to that training, see if you do 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.890
 a picture before a picture later you will see 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.400
 that the pumping is greater then 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.759
 we are talking about let's continue 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.949
 well , our section of 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.810
 next answer you already know that 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.050
 we have the facebook social network

 a section where professional answers 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.310
 where where do I know where I'm going answering the 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.020
 questions with was happening at every time 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.729
 more saturated and there are many and all 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.139

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.470
 which are well answered I do not answer 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.410
