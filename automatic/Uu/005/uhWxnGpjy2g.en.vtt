assault<00:00:45.239> rifle<00:00:45.600> looks<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.770> probably

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
assault rifle looks like it's probably

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
assault rifle looks like it's probably
gonna<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.090> guns<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> the

game and here's just a few of the abs
this<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.440> ump45<00:00:53.250> hopefully<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.329> looks

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this one is the ump45 hopefully it looks

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
this one is the ump45 hopefully it looks
to<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> same<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.739> mono<00:00:55.920> 43

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to be the same as the one from mono 43

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
to be the same as the one from mono 43
probably<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.989> similar<00:00:58.079> looks<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.070> like

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
probably very similar looks to be like

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
probably very similar looks to be like
the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.520> exact<00:00:59.820> thing<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.329> from

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the same exact thing not the one from

the same exact thing not the one from
one<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> mono<00:01:01.440> 43<00:01:01.800> version<00:01:02.160> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
one or two but the mono 43 version so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.750 
one or two but the mono 43 version so
that's<00:01:02.969> pretty<00:01:03.120> cool<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> ump45<00:01:04.760> next

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that's pretty cool have the ump45 next

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's pretty cool have the ump45 next
gun<00:01:05.970> being<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.220> m4a1<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.520> m4<00:01:08.970> carbine

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gun being the m4a1 or m4 carbine

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
gun being the m4a1 or m4 carbine
probably<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> m4a1<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> looks<00:01:10.619> exactly<00:01:10.740> like

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
probably the m4a1 it looks exactly like

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
probably the m4a1 it looks exactly like
the<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.700> offer<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.600> excuse<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.680> uh

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
the one from my offer to or excuse me uh
or<00:01:14.250> isn't<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.689> i<00:01:15.720> believe<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
or isn't one or two yeah i believe so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
or isn't one or two yeah i believe so
and<00:01:16.380> here's<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> red<00:01:17.909> dot<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> looks

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and here's just the red dot for it looks

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.679 
and here's just the red dot for it looks
exactly<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> same<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> moving<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
exactly the same and so moving on to the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.649 
exactly the same and so moving on to the
next<00:01:21.960> weapon<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:24.299> looks<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
next weapon would be the what looks to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.840 
next weapon would be the what looks to
be<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.070> ak-47<00:01:26.070> i<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.369> isn't<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.670> best

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
be the ak-47 i know this isn't the best

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.260 
be the ak-47 i know this isn't the best
picture<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:29.100> looks<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> me<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.150> an

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
picture it looks to me like it's an

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
picture it looks to me like it's an
aching<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.630> sin<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> don't<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.680> they

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
aching for sin I don't think they

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.280 
aching for sin I don't think they
wouldn't<00:01:32.189> add<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> AK<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
wouldn't add the AK so there's that and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
wouldn't add the AK so there's that and
then<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> last<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> point<00:01:35.520> out

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
then the last time I like to point out

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.670 
then the last time I like to point out
is<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.479> entirely<00:01:36.930> sure<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.500> gun

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is I'm not entirely sure what this gun

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800 
is I'm not entirely sure what this gun
is<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.939> say<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> an

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is but to me I would say that it is an

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.480 
is but to me I would say that it is an
ACR<00:01:40.320> um<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.329> UH<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.200> looks<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.340> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
ACR um in the UH it looks like you can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
ACR um in the UH it looks like you can
see<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.759> angles<00:01:45.090> isn't<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.479> greatest<00:01:45.600> photo

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
see this angles isn't the greatest photo

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.210 
see this angles isn't the greatest photo
but<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> know<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
but you know you can see like kind of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
but you know you can see like kind of
like<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.490> rim<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> top<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.360> makes<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like that rim on the top what makes it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
like that rim on the top what makes it
look<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.869> an<00:01:48.990> ACR<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.860> handle<00:01:50.250> looks<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
look like an ACR the handle looks the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
look like an ACR the handle looks the
same<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.079> ACR<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
same so I think this is an ACR which is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
same so I think this is an ACR which is
great<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> ACR<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.549> always<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> great

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
great because the ACR is always a great

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
great because the ACR is always a great
