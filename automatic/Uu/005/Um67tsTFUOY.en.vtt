same length of hair however you can see

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.920 
same length of hair however you can see
that<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.740> different<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that they look very different this is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
that they look very different this is
called<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.229> straight<00:01:40.470> 7<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
called a straight 7 and you can see the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
called a straight 7 and you can see the
jaggedness<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.409> cutting

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
jaggedness it's really just for cutting

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
jaggedness it's really just for cutting
through<00:01:44.280> mats<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.450> super

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
through mats you do want to be super

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.630 
through mats you do want to be super
careful<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.950> wouldn't<00:01:47.310> recommend

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
careful I actually wouldn't recommend

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
careful I actually wouldn't recommend
this<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> novice<00:01:49.259> homebrew<00:01:49.710> learner<00:01:49.890> once

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this to a novice homebrew learner once

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
this to a novice homebrew learner once
you<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:51.210> advanced<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you get a little more advanced you can

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
you get a little more advanced you can
get<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.740> also<00:01:52.890> good<00:01:53.189> for

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
get one of these it's also good for

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
get one of these it's also good for
skimming<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.240> we'll<00:01:54.990> talk<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
skimming which we'll talk about in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.399 
skimming which we'll talk about in
smoother<00:01:55.890> grooming<00:01:56.100> videos<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> 7

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
smoother grooming videos and this is a 7

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.770 
smoother grooming videos and this is a 7
F<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.040> obviously<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> much<00:02:00.060> safer<00:02:00.299> blade<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
F it's obviously a much safer blade it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.700 
F it's obviously a much safer blade it
is<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> same<00:02:01.290> length

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is the same length

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
is the same length
most<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> blades<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> want

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
most of the blades you're going to want

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.780 
most of the blades you're going to want
to<00:02:03.390> stick

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to stick

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.450 
to stick
we'll<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.510> F<00:02:04.950> version<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.160> don't<00:02:06.340> let<00:02:06.430> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
we'll be the F version so don't let that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.710 
we'll be the F version so don't let that
confuse<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:07.000> if<00:02:07.240> you're<00:02:07.360> looking<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.660> a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
confuse you if you're looking in a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.680 
confuse you if you're looking in a
catalogue<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.440> also<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.060> number<00:02:10.390> four

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
catalogue and also it the number four

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.270 
catalogue and also it the number four
blade<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> number<00:02:11.470> five<00:02:11.710> blade<00:02:12.040> also

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
blade and the number five blade also

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.370 
blade and the number five blade also
come<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.700> these<00:02:12.790> variations<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:14.290> you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
come in these variations so what you

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.930 
come in these variations so what you
want<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> look<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.250> F<00:02:15.430> at<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> end

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
want to look for is that F at the end

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.970 
want to look for is that F at the end
that's<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.720> best<00:02:16.960> blade<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.620> using

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
that's the the best blade to be using

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.300 
that's the the best blade to be using
and<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.050> longer<00:02:20.350> blade<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.160> a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
and it's just a longer blade this is a

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310 
and it's just a longer blade this is a
3/4<00:02:21.850> blade<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.420> leaves<00:02:22.600> about<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> half<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> an

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
3/4 blade it leaves about a half of an

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.140 
3/4 blade it leaves about a half of an
inch<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:24.100> see<00:02:24.310> obviously<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
inch so you can see obviously that the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.750 
inch so you can see obviously that the
lengths<00:02:25.480> vary<00:02:26.470> quite<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.860> bit<00:02:27.070> on<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.520> blades

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
lengths vary quite a bit on the blades

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.350 
lengths vary quite a bit on the blades
and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.780> also<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.500> want<00:02:29.650> even<00:02:29.860> longer

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and then also if you want even longer

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
and then also if you want even longer
open<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.420> comb<00:02:31.660> attachment<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.440> top<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:32.950> your

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
open a comb attachment on top of your

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.630 
open a comb attachment on top of your
blade<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.140> go<00:02:35.230> over<00:02:35.410> Adam<00:02:35.770> trimming

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
blade I want to go over Adam trimming

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.870 
blade I want to go over Adam trimming
tools<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.450> scissors<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.810> whatnot<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.880> pretty

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
tools the scissors and whatnot I pretty

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.090 
tools the scissors and whatnot I pretty
much<00:02:40.000> sit<00:02:40.300> with<00:02:40.540> curved<00:02:41.080> shears<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.950> also

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
much sit with curved shears you can also

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.770 
much sit with curved shears you can also
buy<00:02:42.310> straight<00:02:42.580> shears<00:02:42.880> however<00:02:43.360> if<00:02:43.630> you're

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
buy straight shears however if you're

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
buy straight shears however if you're
going<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.170> invest<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:45.010> one<00:02:45.190> pair<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.459> would

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
going to invest in just one pair I would

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.699 
going to invest in just one pair I would
recommend<00:02:46.150> getting<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.630> curve<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
recommend getting the curve and not the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.620 
recommend getting the curve and not the
straights<00:02:48.010> straights<00:02:48.910> are<00:02:49.030> good<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.360> doing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
straights straights are good for doing

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.110 
straights straights are good for doing
you<00:02:50.020> know<00:02:50.110> bottoms<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.590> skirts<00:02:50.890> back<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.459> legs

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you know bottoms of skirts back of legs

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120 
you know bottoms of skirts back of legs
however<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.110> know<00:02:53.230> rounding<00:02:53.650> feet<00:02:53.860> things

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
however you know rounding feet things

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.370 
however you know rounding feet things
like<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.520> most<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.540> hair<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.050> cutting

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
like that most of the hair to be cutting

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.070 
like that most of the hair to be cutting
is<00:02:56.530> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.770> be<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.580> curved<00:02:58.300> pattern<00:02:58.630> so

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
is going to be in a curved pattern so

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960 
is going to be in a curved pattern so
instead<00:02:59.890> if<00:03:00.010> you're<00:03:00.100> going<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.580> buy<00:03:00.730> one

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
instead if you're going to just buy one

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.330 
instead if you're going to just buy one
pair<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.480> would<00:03:01.630> go<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:01.900> curved<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:03.160> these

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
pair I would go with curved and these

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.570 
pair I would go with curved and these
come<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.670> different<00:03:03.700> lengths<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.510> shorter<00:03:05.050> is

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
come in different lengths the shorter is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.280 
come in different lengths the shorter is
probably<00:03:06.580> better<00:03:06.910> because<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.690> safer<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
probably better because it's safer the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.140 
probably better because it's safer the
longer<00:03:08.620> ones<00:03:08.830> are<00:03:09.130> obviously<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.030> can

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
longer ones are obviously on you can

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.790 
longer ones are obviously on you can
groom<00:03:10.330> faster<00:03:10.840> however<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.620> home

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
groom faster however just the home

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.520 
groom faster however just the home
groomer<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.370> would<00:03:12.970> stick<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:14.500> a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
groomer I would stick with with a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.490 
groomer I would stick with with a
shorter<00:03:15.690> scissors<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:16.900> get<00:03:17.050> them<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
shorter scissors you can get them you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.070 
shorter scissors you can get them you
know<00:03:17.650> with<00:03:17.890> ten<00:03:18.160> inches<00:03:18.489> long<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.090> again<00:03:19.900> for

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
know with ten inches long but again for

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.420 
know with ten inches long but again for
safety<00:03:20.440> stick<00:03:20.739> with<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.040> shorter<00:03:21.400> version

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
safety stick with the shorter version

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.190 
safety stick with the shorter version
one<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.510> things<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.810> can't<00:03:22.989> live<00:03:23.110> without

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
one of the things I can't live without

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.380 
one of the things I can't live without
are<00:03:23.530> my<00:03:23.650> thinning<00:03:23.860> shears<00:03:24.280> exactly<00:03:25.239> would

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
are my thinning shears exactly would

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.580
