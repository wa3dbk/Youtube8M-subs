there in that spot I can get the chest

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
there in that spot I can get the chest
five<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.200> six<00:01:55.500> times<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.850> reopen<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
five to six times you can reopen the

same chest five to six times from that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
same chest five to six times from that
gate<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.310> by<00:01:59.399> running<00:01:59.579> through<00:01:59.939> those<00:02:00.119> doors

decided to make this quick video well
this<00:03:05.050> video<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.290> actually<00:03:05.410> not<00:03:05.650> quick<00:03:05.890> because

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
this video is actually not quick because

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.260 
this video is actually not quick because
I<00:03:06.250> wanted<00:03:06.460> to<00:03:06.550> add<00:03:06.640> something<00:03:06.700> about<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
trials of Osiris at the end of the video

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.580 
trials of Osiris at the end of the video
if<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.100> can<00:03:09.250> make<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.760> far<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.260> just
