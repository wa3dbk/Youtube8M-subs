 gave focus to have a coffee there khan 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.890
 the winner the staff thinks that the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.930
 with advantage because it is not a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.660
 rest six hours 7 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.800
 I still think there are people who wake up 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:18.470
 work or else I would not have that coffee 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 self-esteem service that abruptly 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.810
 left to the end of this size in the ever 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.810
 it can not be a little over an hour 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.080
 it was rain to the capital last night to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.430
 young man who got dry morning 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.430
 I hear you are in the city 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.680
 opportunity usually has a lot of people 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.630
 who has a lot of opportunity even because 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.880
 this much people 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.119
 city and if I do not have it, 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.119
 what is 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.790
 respect the traffic laws it rained 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.950
 quite late last night the track is already 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.770
 practically if the track 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.350
 It will open at 9 o'clock and there are still 17 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.010
 hours which will make these two areas 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.010
 still has 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:42.950
 I will teach you to pass the time without 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.870
 to prevent the pending spending 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.260
 Weather I recommend to you. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.610
 This game here, man, if I'm not mistaken, that's it. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.610
 give him his name 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.640
 3rd game to keep you focus focus 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.640
 memory focus 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.849
 to memorize 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.849
 the previous no yes 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.530
 all this guy 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.420
 the cinema 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.330
 it 's none of the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.620
 memorize pattern 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.310
 It's a good exercise to do the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:28.419
 then you take some risks like that and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.039
 then 70 find something that you 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:39.360
 can transform into a real drawing 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:46.259
 Brazilian type that I can do here. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.259
 Here it a purple O O 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.729
 Look there in the middle of that mess I 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.900
 I think if I can make this guy super 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:10.690
 abstract the right rubber man and also 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.630
 Could I have seen another drawing 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.400
 Kika could do something else, okay? 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.990
 seeing this piece here if that can be 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.330
 a chicken thigh 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.330
 oh if you catch it here like this 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.450
 Do you realize that she became the target of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.450
 Frank and this one of a shark 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.440
 Look, this is working creativity. 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.580
 your look on things look 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.640
 creative 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.250
 time passes and you do not even notice predict 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.350
 how many hours are already 7 50 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.410
 or in one hour and ten minutes one 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:57.360
 park opens in an hour and ten 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.470
 minutes they'll open the park and I 'll go 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.320
 to be able to take a leisurely stroll while 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.960
 This will work on creativity here. 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.590
 to pass the time this same drawing 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.230
 that I did here I will try to reproduce the 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.970
 with the left hand 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.970
 I already made some first traces here 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.889
 He's so crazy at first and he's here. 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.889
 very difficult 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:39.530
 I looked at the left hand in the classic 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.780
 a work of art with appeared rock 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.250
 reached the floor suite will work the 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.350
 other side of the brain 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.900
 there are people who speak that finds it difficult to 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.370
 walk on one side rhyme on one side one 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.970
 maneuvering the other 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.320
 the confusion is the rhyme guy with the leg 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.490
 this balance with the other and sends a 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.500
 work with the other 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.030
 all these are nice things for you 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.950
 pass the time 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.800
 The cell phone is cool, but since you 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:07.400
 uses in a useful way if you do not pass 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.960
 time only seeing gossip joke you do not 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.030
 You will get nowhere with the best. 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.030
 You're going to get nowhere if
