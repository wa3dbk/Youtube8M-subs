00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.840
 hi people this is the second batch 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.190
 boards for simple to study at sea studio and 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 this time studio network is not really 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 pleased with the time of payment 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.740
 drove 29 days is a little more than four 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 weeks that is a very long time but for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.590
 This time I managed to write and software and this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 very good 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 mail is also not particularly pleased here 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.090
 crumpled box, moreover, quite seriously 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 falls down 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 I'm not even sure that there is a whole fee 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.160
 Now we will sort it out and see 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 declared value as always 11 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 dollars here is such a box by the way 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.039
 parcels seem to send some 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 third-party company says here that 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.539
 wanted to return singapore from studio 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.309
 Like in Shenzhen, that's so interesting 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:10.229
 thing 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:27.450
 squared in the country I donâ€™t have much blood on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 shore because it is already ours 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.840
 scarves well, like the last time they 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 reasons of polyethylene and vacuum 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.630
 packaging that is completely laws 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.390
 payment came again from the plant on its own 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.170
 type that is similar send them 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 wear studio 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 and the plant itself for the type that made 9 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.500
 numbers 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 that is, I ordered them 3 that is for six 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.689
 days and did and all the other 20 are not they 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.840
 traveled the world but in principle not 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.700
 so scary well let's open 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.050
 let's see what's inside and how they are 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.760
 this time look silkscreen 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.069
 It turned out much worse than the past 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.090
 just here if you look at the microcircuit 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.020
 here it is for example 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.260
 It can be seen that silk screen is heavily biased and 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.209
 it's bad because it almost fits 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.290
 attack that is, they are not big here 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.930
 and generally very bad well the same thing is 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.580
 look at the diodes silk screen offset 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.180
 then on the back almost 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.610
 same in some places even she 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.530
 not really about the printed some letters 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.930
 poorly visible then there is everything here is bad 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.610
 the brain is quite normal mask in the center 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.349
 ie Moscow no complaints 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.400
 paths, too, there are no traitors but 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:57.870
 silk screening is terrible and the edges are very sharp and 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.180
 that's just about one of the edges 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.530
 it was cut also not they not so 3 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.019
 let's look at all the boards 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.450
 such an offset is well on this 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.050
 to the board a little bit 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.700
 it is evident that she found the graph funny but they are so 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.959
 strongly on this board on this board too 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.940
 something in between these two 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:29.890
 In general, everywhere there is important that changing 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.010
 honestly not well, that's how it came 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.230
 it's ok now what's left 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.680
 collect so see you soon 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.680
 until
