this one identity it doesn't work like

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.780 
this one identity it doesn't work like
that<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.590> human<00:03:08.890> mind<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.280> lot<00:03:09.580> like<00:03:09.760> a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that the human mind is a lot like a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.760 
that the human mind is a lot like a
government<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.200> what<00:03:11.350> kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.620> government

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
government so what kind of government

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.250 
government so what kind of government
are<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.070> running<00:03:12.430> up<00:03:12.520> there<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.810> quote<00:03:14.080> from
