00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Welcome to a new and cool episode 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.299
 Today we do the dragon tail 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.690
 tutorial that you give each pattern 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.370
 I really wanted to mine first 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.710
 need remaining jackie rubbers on 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 because I do not like it that way 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 I have done this before and yes 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 you do not need it 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.000
 You really want her that he wants to go 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.170
 I desperately wanted to have user 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 where you do not need a frame and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.290
 why we do it today do so 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.020
 I take white and pink and yes now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 Let's go for the beginning 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 and a rubber and put that right 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.440
 Let's start and beat that over 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.539
 Cross over the second cable 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.879
 tip but you take another 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 second and we'll do it too 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:05.220
 cross them so to speak on each 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.700
 two fork tips off a rubber 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.310
 midnight so a little bit down 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.689
 and pull that in the back best 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 a bit out so that punishes a bit 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.650
 but that will be a regular fine 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 he always sits a bit with the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.460
 Forefinger backwards so here it is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.570
 Taut is your second color we do 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.799
 always easy in the middle 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.360
 so now we fix the whole 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:40.049
 Of course you can do that with your fingers 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:41.549
 make and push back down if 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.350
 you can not do it with your finger 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.189
 Of course, just here as in each 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.780
 This year , a little after Hegel 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.030
 take needle of course that is synonymous 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.460
 Now we take the other driver 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.979
 This is of course pink for me and lays 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.259
 from the right, the first two 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.280
 and from the left over the first two 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.780
 should now of course a bit of the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.700
 times obendrÃ¼ber it all over the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.369
 Now I'll do it with the needle 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 in which you can see the lower one above 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:23.050
 the bottom wise about others 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.050
 still wise and the lower pinker 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.910
 push it all down again 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.800
 now we have to do the middle one like that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.790
 and we have to do that before we get there 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.860
 carry on has to fix again 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.360
 to do this we take the lower pink 2 in 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.360
 the middle and make it over it 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.319
 Now we take two pinks again 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.819
 the once on the first two of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.130
 come to the right and the first two 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:01.819
 from the left and now we give again 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.470
 over all four so i'll show you this 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.300
 whole is about a close-up 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.989
 So we have ours down here now 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:14.269
 four pinks lie or pink in the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.350
 middle now comes the white that 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.350
 we have to fix that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.450
 push down a bit and now 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.540
 Let's take two rosanna again 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.020
 on the right two houses and from the left the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.740
 two outer ones and they are now too 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.740
 moored again 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:47.360
 over all four cable tips 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.950
 that would have made a piece of it 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.280
 you can always have that beautiful 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.720
 pull back and that's how it looks 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.950
 pattern off so we'll meet again 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.480
 At the end, I'll show you how to do it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.209
 the whole handicapped and yes to the same 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.110
 just do it with the end 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:17.480
 right and does that on the next door 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:21.560
 is and from the left side 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.820
 you take the rubber and does it in 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.340
 the other pin 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.680
 so now you have the two rubbers here 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.320
 four pieces each still count 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.030
 just the bottom blow that over the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.750
 warnow over that makes yes on the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:41.639
 right side up and now you can 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.629
 that you do 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:49.409
 Woman fit down slides and then 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:52.889
 take the other skin or do that 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:56.389
 here on the other with the want to clip 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.310
 and just hook it in again 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.749
 We'll do that now with the two 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.749
 rubbers on the other side 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:19.170
 and you're done and it's for beginners 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:21.870
 actually well suited to first 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.800
 look if that is for you yes me 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.550
