overall<00:02:03.490> possession<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.060> sometimes<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.900> can

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
overall possession and sometimes you can

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.109 
overall possession and sometimes you can
get<00:02:05.110> away<00:02:05.200> with<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> pair<00:02:05.890> their<00:02:06.250> pace<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:06.820> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
team goals that's pretty good for a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.480 
team goals that's pretty good for a
right<00:05:15.550> wing<00:05:15.759> it's<00:05:16.570> nothing<00:05:16.750> special<00:05:17.110> but<00:05:17.490> as

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
right wing it's nothing special but as

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.890 
right wing it's nothing special but as
maybe<00:05:18.850> not<00:05:19.030> as<00:05:19.120> good<00:05:19.270> as<00:05:19.360> like<00:05:19.600> previous

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
maybe not as good as like previous

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.499 
maybe not as good as like previous
squads<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.530> etc<00:05:20.770> later<00:05:21.130> but<00:05:21.850> it's<00:05:22.000> just<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
squads and etc later but it's just the

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.200 
squads and etc later but it's just the
squad<00:05:23.169> is<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.979> really<00:05:24.160> hard<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.820> play<00:05:25.000> with

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
squad is really really hard to play with

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.760 
squad is really really hard to play with
because<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.630> defense<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.139> ridiculously

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
because the defense is ridiculously

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.620 
because the defense is ridiculously
awful<00:05:26.979> in<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.370> goalkeeper<00:05:27.850> just<00:05:28.330> doesn't

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
awful in the goalkeeper just doesn't

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.230 
awful in the goalkeeper just doesn't
save<00:05:28.810> anything<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:29.800> even<00:05:30.009> get<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.250> one<00:05:30.520> but<00:05:31.210> I

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
save anything so to even get a one but I

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.210 
save anything so to even get a one but I
figure<00:05:31.570> she<00:05:31.630> won<00:05:31.960> this<00:05:32.139> game<00:05:32.199> like<00:05:32.530> 42<00:05:33.039> or

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
figure she won this game like 42 or

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.529 
figure she won this game like 42 or
something<00:05:33.550> like<00:05:33.639> that<00:05:33.699> so<00:05:34.000> that<00:05:34.120> was<00:05:34.210> like<00:05:34.240> one

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
something like that so that was like one

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.360 
something like that so that was like one
of<00:05:34.570> my<00:05:34.690> only<00:05:34.930> ones<00:05:35.229> with<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.440> squad<00:05:35.770> really<00:05:36.160> hard

of my only ones with a squad really hard

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.219 
of my only ones with a squad really hard

attacking players like I did the

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.560 
attacking players like I did the
midfield<00:06:18.940> players<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:19.240> can<00:06:19.330> go<00:06:19.419> ahead<00:06:19.479> and

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
midfield players you can go ahead and

strength<00:06:21.220> is<00:06:21.370> oh<00:06:21.460> cuz<00:06:21.669> I<00:06:21.699> think<00:06:22.120> this<00:06:22.210> was

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
strength is oh cuz I think this was

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.990 
strength is oh cuz I think this was
against<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.659> lumber<00:06:22.840> pool<00:06:23.020> guy<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.699> I<00:06:24.699> think

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
against the lumber pool guy and I think

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.210 
against the lumber pool guy and I think
that<00:06:25.180> was<00:06:25.330> Jose<00:06:25.539> Enrique<00:06:25.810> and<00:06:26.349> he's<00:06:26.740> very<00:06:27.130> very

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
that was Jose Enrique and he's very very

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.370 
that was Jose Enrique and he's very very
strong<00:06:27.699> left<00:06:27.940> but<00:06:28.150> very<00:06:28.449> quickly<00:06:28.630> haltom<00:06:29.229> off

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
strong left but very quickly haltom off

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.350 
strong left but very quickly haltom off
and<00:06:29.590> just<00:06:29.680> finish<00:06:29.979> these<00:06:30.099> perfectly<00:06:30.639> but

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
and just finish these perfectly but

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.399 
and just finish these perfectly but
that's<00:06:31.570> enough<00:06:31.750> violence<00:06:31.900> of<00:06:32.139> this<00:06:32.260> guy

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
that's enough violence of this guy

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.260

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
doesn't work at all the defense is just

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.570
