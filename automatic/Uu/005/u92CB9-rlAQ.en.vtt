00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.980 
passing team this game is gonna be a
passing<00:04:30.560> game<00:04:31.390> you're<00:04:32.390> gonna<00:04:32.450> be<00:04:32.690> able<00:04:32.810> to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
passing game you're gonna be able to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.450 
passing game you're gonna be able to
spread<00:04:33.200> out<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.350> field<00:04:33.830> you're<00:04:34.280> gonna<00:04:34.370> have

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
spread out the field you're gonna have

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.280 
spread out the field you're gonna have
to<00:04:34.580> be<00:04:34.730> able<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.180> use<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.720> information<00:04:35.990> to

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
to be able to use the information to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.740 
to be able to use the information to
pass<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.710> ball<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.790> think<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.270> PlayBook

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
pass the ball and I think the PlayBook

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.210 
pass the ball and I think the PlayBook
that<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.230> have<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.740> is<00:04:39.890> gonna<00:04:40.040> be

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
that it's going to have that is gonna be

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.650 
that it's going to have that is gonna be
the<00:04:40.340> Patriots<00:04:40.850> playbook<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:41.510> i'm<00:04:41.630> thinking

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
the Patriots playbook so i'm thinking

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.830 
the Patriots playbook so i'm thinking
i'll<00:04:42.290> try<00:04:42.710> out<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.950> bad<00:04:43.160> guys<00:04:43.480> i'm<00:04:44.480> gonna<00:04:44.630> use

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
i'll try out the bad guys i'm gonna use

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.350 
i'll try out the bad guys i'm gonna use

guys<00:04:52.910> I'm<00:04:53.270> thinking<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:53.840> coming<00:04:54.110> up<00:04:54.260> and

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
guys I'm thinking and coming up and

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.710 
guys I'm thinking and coming up and
under<00:04:55.040> England<00:04:55.460> playbook<00:04:55.850> that's<00:04:56.480> what<00:04:56.630> I'm

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
under England playbook that's what I'm

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.380 
under England playbook that's what I'm
thinking<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.170> an<00:04:57.410> especially<00:04:58.010> big<00:04:58.880> spread<00:04:59.270> out

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
thinking of an especially big spread out

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.500 
thinking of an especially big spread out
the<00:04:59.540> floor<00:04:59.840> of<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.710> field<00:05:01.430> they<00:05:02.090> could<00:05:02.360> do

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
the floor of the field they could do

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.390 
the floor of the field they could do
screens<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:03.170> have<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> bunch<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.950> passing

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
screens they have a bunch of passing

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120 
screens they have a bunch of passing
plays<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.910> most<00:05:05.060> passing<00:05:05.630> place<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.830> almost

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
plays the most passing place and almost

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.240 
plays the most passing place and almost
all<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.670> other<00:05:08.090> playbooks<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.870> saw<00:05:09.140> hey<00:05:09.710> let<00:05:10.160> me
