sprayer that we recommend it compared to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.090 
sprayer that we recommend it compared to
the<00:03:02.680> other<00:03:03.160> sprayer<00:03:03.460> had<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.830> yeah<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.010> is

much better also the handles more
comfortable<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.410> noticed<00:03:09.160> when<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.459> was<00:03:09.730> using

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
comfortable I noticed when I was using

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.120 
comfortable I noticed when I was using
the<00:03:10.090> other<00:03:10.209> hand<00:03:10.450> away<00:03:10.600> actually<00:03:11.020> my<00:03:11.830> fingers

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
sore cuz the handle was really thin and

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.350 
sore cuz the handle was really thin and
it<00:03:17.320> didn't<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.739> hardly<00:03:18.070> any<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.550> grippy

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
it didn't have hardly any like grippy

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.270 
it didn't have hardly any like grippy
areas<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.320> see<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.860> grippy

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
areas if you can see is little grippy

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.490 
areas if you can see is little grippy
arrows<00:03:21.550> fingers<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.360> things<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:23.230> much

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
arrows fingers and things it's just much

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.800 
arrows fingers and things it's just much
softer<00:03:24.010> much<00:03:24.190> better<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> supports<00:03:25.239> more

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
softer much better on the supports more

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.990 
softer much better on the supports more
comfortable<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.580> course<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.880> does

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
comfortable and of course it does

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.640 
comfortable and of course it does
exactly<00:03:28.239> what<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.600> says<00:03:28.630> on<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.110> bottle<00:03:29.560> as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
exactly what it says on the bottle as

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.310 
exactly what it says on the bottle as
well<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.610> recommend<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:32.110> three

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
well so I recommend that it's three

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380 
well so I recommend that it's three
pounds<00:03:32.770> but<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.190> think<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.640> quite<00:03:33.820> worth<00:03:34.090> it

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
pounds but I think it's quite worth it

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.360 
pounds but I think it's quite worth it
you<00:03:34.959> get<00:03:35.110> quite<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> lot<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.650> there<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.250> it's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
you get quite a lot in there and it's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.729 
you get quite a lot in there and it's
actually<00:03:36.459> last<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.000> mean<00:03:37.090> quite<00:03:37.269> while<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.560> I've

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
actually last I mean quite while so I've

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.770 
actually last I mean quite while so I've
definitely<00:03:38.980> recommend<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.790> Johnson's

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
definitely recommend that Johnson's

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.070 
definitely recommend that Johnson's
clean<00:03:41.019> safe<00:03:41.290> spray<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:43.540> these<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
clean safe spray then these are the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.220 
clean safe spray then these are the
treats<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.459> they<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:45.880> have<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.239> these<00:03:46.450> but

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
treats so they will have on these but

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.840 
treats so they will have on these but
they'll<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.530> some<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.130> these<00:03:48.220> treats<00:03:48.580> as

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
they'll have some of these treats as

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.460 
they'll have some of these treats as
they<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:49.180> older<00:03:49.239> when<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.840> know<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.200> old

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
they get older when I know that old

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.259 
they get older when I know that old
enough<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.950> have<00:03:51.130> some<00:03:51.400> because<00:03:51.970> I've<00:03:52.090> got<00:03:52.209> to

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
enough to have some because I've got to

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.040
