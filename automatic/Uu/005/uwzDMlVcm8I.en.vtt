00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 Brownie

 really incredible treats and so did we 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.340
 just start with the 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.890
 one in 50 grams of vanilla sugar from RTL 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.399
 collapse is 10 grams I take 5 bags 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.399
 make an offer whereby than 4-axis at 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 My people always adhere to ight 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.030
 Whipped but no problem we were Efkes 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 off 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 you can go further you are not well under 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 mixing together everyone is a hand mixer 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.740
 answer will be a very lighthearted 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.659
 get anira is no result 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.939
 problem then I do my beater is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.420
 important that it is very solid as a result 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420
 each other is correct 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.070
 voila that is lightly beaten 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:42.729
 and if you put it aside first 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:45.549
 let 's melt our butter with our 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.119
 don't do black fire here 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.579
 up because he had to get used to chocolate 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.100
 I use now but he can of course 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.240
 feel free to use real butter 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.759
 but I don't stick to the real one myself 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.470
 butter flavor definitely take in pastries and 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.119
 chocolate head to the play but none 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.939
 problem if you have a large butter often 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.110
 then you have to do it again 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.039
 it is really one of my favorite 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.810
 moments 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.790
 she now looks that wonderfully shiny one 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.069
 chocolate that gave me the fire 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.220
 We take our own sake mixture 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.660
 endlessly mixed together 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.329
 sugar issued in a sole 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:33.700
 and i take if a chocolate is with this 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.410
 why not bake so nice look at all 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.400
 bosses herein too quickly become one 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.400
 great result 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.299
 delicious mixture 3 can it or me 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.290
 group and we add the 120 grams 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.290
 self-rising flour from and recovered from 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.720
 I take a strainer to prevent you 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
 lumps now that I have to heal too 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
 honest about it than try to always 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.260
 when I am in a hurry or very little 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.669
 time can also dare so is forgotten 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 and in itself no problem you would 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:06.359
 just for that you blend all the time 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.489
 there was not a hundred to shoot you but 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:16.690
 that is sifted name angels quietly 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.060
 Brownings to him and finally add 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.180
 of course our hazelnuts 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.600
 200 grams 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.180
 and the 100 grams of milk chocolate 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.460
 I now have those little bubbles 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.710
 lie that you can get the trade but 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.050
 you have to union home no problem you 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.390
 regular milk chocolate I only have one 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.640
 settle for a brownie 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 comes to the chocolate use good show 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.300
 channel result is only possible 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.050
 taste better with quality show 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.520
 channels 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.380
 you a special square baking pan 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.210
 you can't do anything for brownies 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.120
 again home no problem in just one 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.290
 ovendish take another form, the cake 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.820
 brown with a small one afterwards 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.040
 pieces are made 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.860
 principle does not matter much for feeling 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 our brownie dough in the form and burn 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.200
 is a flat looked we go here about 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.480
 make sure our dough 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.310
 Is 1 to 2 centimeters thick and sit this 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.580
 we are now in a preheated oven of 180 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.580
 degrees 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.949
 if a woman is ready after 35 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.229
 minutes in the oven 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.719
 a brown one is kind of an idea 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.759
 so quickly take a myth out of shape 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.860
 turn it on properly and not off 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.889
 each other with one gram has meanwhile 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.889
 cooled down and finished from the van 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.930
 and cut it into pieces 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.860
 traditionally being in a brownie 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.020

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.419

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.509

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.490
 Brownie
