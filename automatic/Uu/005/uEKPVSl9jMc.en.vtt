Guzan<00:00:41.339> like<00:00:41.489> oh<00:00:42.260> that's<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:44.039> a<00:00:44.070> plexi

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Guzan like oh that's up have a plexi

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.509 
Guzan like oh that's up have a plexi
town<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> push<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.010> distortion

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
town you push it in for the distortion

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.299 
town you push it in for the distortion
channel<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.679> some<00:00:52.679> of<00:00:52.769> these<00:00:52.829> amps<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.159> we

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
channel and some of these amps that we

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.560 
channel and some of these amps that we
have<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.519> here<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:54.089> have<00:00:54.299> two

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have in here don't actually have two

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.319 
have in here don't actually have two
channels<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.969> created<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.119> would<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
channels so we can created what would it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.259 
channels so we can created what would it
sound<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> had<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.229> or<00:00:59.119> presence<00:01:00.119> on

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
sound like that had one or presence on

the<00:01:00.420> gelato<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.439> on<00:01:01.619> twin

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
the gelato here on twin

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:13.260 
the gelato here on twin
that's<00:01:04.330> adding<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.989> tube<00:01:05.440> screamer<00:01:05.620> and<00:01:12.270> just

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
that's adding a tube screamer and just

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.360 
that's adding a tube screamer and just
going<00:01:13.420> through<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.900> have<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.050> 11<00:01:14.710> stompboxes

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
going through you have a 11 stompboxes

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.770 
going through you have a 11 stompboxes
so<00:01:15.940> like<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.270> UH<00:01:17.170> XR<00:01:18.160> while<00:01:18.430> just<00:01:18.910> like<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.210> Zakk

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
so like a UH XR while just like the Zakk

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.290 
so like a UH XR while just like the Zakk
Wylde

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300

stop concerns over you got wah pedal and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.570 
stop concerns over you got wah pedal and
a<00:03:29.170> volume<00:03:29.500> pedal<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.890> can<00:03:29.920> change<00:03:30.310> them<00:03:30.430> back

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
a volume pedal you can change them back

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.890 
a volume pedal you can change them back
and<00:03:30.790> forth<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.210> use<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.660> pitch

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and forth you can use it as a pitch

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.050 
and forth you can use it as a pitch
shifter<00:03:32.260> pedal<00:03:33.540> yeah<00:03:35.250> USB<00:03:36.250> recording<00:03:36.610> out

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
shifter pedal yeah USB recording out

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.360 
shifter pedal yeah USB recording out
plus<00:03:37.330> if<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.830> got<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.770> so<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.070> plug<00:03:42.220> this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
plus if you got it and so you plug this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.860 
plus if you got it and so you plug this
in<00:03:42.520> your<00:03:42.580> computer<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.180> run<00:03:43.450> off<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.690> bed<00:03:43.840> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
in your computer and run off the bed and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.110 
in your computer and run off the bed and
sees<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.680> sound<00:03:45.250> card<00:03:45.490> and<00:03:45.820> you've<00:03:45.940> got

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
sees it as a sound card and you've got

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.380 
sees it as a sound card and you've got
the<00:03:46.890> recording<00:03:47.890> quality<00:03:48.100> sound<00:03:48.970> card<00:03:49.239> right

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
the recording quality sound card right

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.070 
the recording quality sound card right
there<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.850> power<00:03:51.850> spun<00:03:52.270> iris<00:03:52.720> punch<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:52.989> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
there so power spun iris punch on the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.650 
there so power spun iris punch on the
Sun<00:03:53.260> state<00:03:53.530> models<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.640> not<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.330> master

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
Sun state models it's not the master

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.160 
Sun state models it's not the master
volume<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.230> actually<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.709> reducing<00:03:57.400> power

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
volume and actually is reducing power

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.960 
volume and actually is reducing power
capability<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.500> so<00:04:00.010> basically<00:04:00.310> you've

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
capability of the so basically you've

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.780 
capability of the so basically you've
got<00:04:01.120> 75<00:04:01.450> watts<00:04:01.989> here<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.560> 30<00:04:02.830> watts<00:04:03.130> here<00:04:03.459> on

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
got 75 watts here and 30 watts here on
