many<00:00:01.589> times<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.399> have<00:00:02.790> been<00:00:02.820> unsure<00:00:04.069> what<00:00:05.069> Jesus

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
many times I have been unsure what Jesus

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.450 
many times I have been unsure what Jesus
would<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.210> me<00:00:06.540> do<00:00:07.880> when<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.420> unsure<00:00:10.460> we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
would have me do when we are unsure we

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.419 
would have me do when we are unsure we
seek<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.090> clarity<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.929> comes<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:14.130> Jesus

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
seek the clarity that comes from Jesus

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.340 
seek the clarity that comes from Jesus
through<00:00:14.880> prayer<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:17.119> lot<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> times<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.990> have

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
through prayer a lot of times I have

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.029 
through prayer a lot of times I have
misinterpreted<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:21.320> Jesus<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.740> me

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
misinterpreted what Jesus would have me

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
misinterpreted what Jesus would have me
do<00:00:24.619> but<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.890> am<00:00:25.920> learning<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.580> even<00:00:27.570> though<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
do but I am learning that even though I

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.639 
do but I am learning that even though I
may<00:00:28.949> misinterpret<00:00:30.890> Jesus<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.160> still<00:00:32.489> lead<00:00:32.790> me

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
may misinterpret Jesus can still lead me

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.319 
may misinterpret Jesus can still lead me
it<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> matter<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.180> our<00:00:37.070> interpretation

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
but it is a matter of our heart

but it is a matter of our heart
condition<00:00:42.890> if<00:00:43.910> our<00:00:44.910> heart<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.989> with

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
condition if our heart really is with

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580

to<00:01:11.580> move<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.979> owned<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.610> house<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.270> some

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to move we owned a house and some

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.789 
to move we owned a house and some
property<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.970> Jesus<00:01:17.970> called<00:01:18.270> us<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.720> sell<00:01:19.619> our

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

where<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.509> were<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.240> assumed<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
where we were going so I assumed that I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
where we were going so I assumed that I
should<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:29.009> applying<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.090> jobs<00:01:30.390> around<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
should be applying for jobs around the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.999 
should be applying for jobs around the
area<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> started<00:01:33.479> applying<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.590> nearby

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
area so I started applying for a nearby

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.819 
area so I started applying for a nearby
Costco<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:37.759> did<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> receive<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.840> call<00:01:40.470> back

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
Costco I did not receive one call back

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.410 
Costco I did not receive one call back
from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> managers<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.509> had<00:01:42.720> talked<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:44.420> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
from the managers I had talked to and I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.679 
from the managers I had talked to and I
realized<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:47.670> misinterpreted<00:01:48.659> what

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
realized that I had misinterpreted what

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.679 
realized that I had misinterpreted what
Jesus<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.710> me<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:51.240> kept<00:01:51.509> on

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
Jesus would have me do we kept on

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.219 
Jesus would have me do we kept on
praying<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.740> became<00:01:53.220> clear<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.990> were

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
praying and it became clear that we were

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
praying and it became clear that we were
not<00:01:55.560> even<00:01:55.920> supposed<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> area

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
not even supposed to be in the area

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.810 
not even supposed to be in the area
anymore<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.170> he<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.590> calling<00:01:59.070> us<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.490> clearly

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
anymore but he was calling us to clearly

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.660 
anymore but he was calling us to clearly
move<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> area<00:02:02.189> entirely<00:02:04.670> clarity

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
move out of the area entirely clarity

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300 
move out of the area entirely clarity
comes<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.540> diligently<00:02:06.810> seek<00:02:07.619> Jesus<00:02:08.129> in
