this a Java app because honestly I think

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020 
this a Java app because honestly I think
every<00:01:52.979> kid<00:01:53.070> gets<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.460> sort<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> lock<00:01:53.850> up

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's not a deal breaker the last issue

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's not a deal breaker the last issue
is<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> center<00:01:59.219> had<00:01:59.369> this

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is actually the way the center had this

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
is actually the way the center had this
builds<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.299> gap<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.719> large<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
builds the gap is very large and if you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
builds the gap is very large and if you
get<00:02:01.409> paint<00:02:01.619> attention<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> puzzle<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> take

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
get paint attention the puzzle you take

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
get paint attention the puzzle you take
out<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> piece<00:02:03.719> before<00:02:03.930> taking<00:02:04.350> off<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> cap<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
out a piece before taking off the cap so

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
out a piece before taking off the cap so
if<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.189> change<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.640> attentions<00:02:06.090> frequently

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
if you change your attentions frequently

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.730 
if you change your attentions frequently
and<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> straw<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.560> before

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and think about the straw back before

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
and think about the straw back before
purchasing<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> puzzle<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> question<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
purchasing the puzzle so the question is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290 
purchasing the puzzle so the question is
it's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.319> thundercloud<00:02:10.679> worth<00:02:10.920> buying<00:02:11.300> earlier

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
it's a thundercloud worth buying earlier

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's a thundercloud worth buying earlier
