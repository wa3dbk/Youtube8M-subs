00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:01.880 

unfortunately<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.140> situation<00:00:01.680> that<00:00:01.770> we've

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
unfortunately the situation that we've

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.919 
unfortunately the situation that we've
got<00:00:02.040> here<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.340> we've<00:00:02.370> got<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:03.000> old<00:00:03.149> row<00:00:03.389> spacing

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
got here is we've got an old row spacing

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.470 
got here is we've got an old row spacing
are<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.350> put<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> break<00:00:04.890> crop<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:06.029> so

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
are about to put a break crop in and so

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.940 
are about to put a break crop in and so
we're<00:00:06.600> having<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.990> invest<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.560> amount<00:00:07.859> of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
we're having to invest an amount of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.919 
we're having to invest an amount of
energy<00:00:08.040> interesting<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> bit<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.510> repair

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
energy interesting to do a bit of repair

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.140 
energy interesting to do a bit of repair
phase<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.070> we've<00:00:11.219> got<00:00:11.400> behind<00:00:11.550> us<00:00:11.910> here

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
phase so what we've got behind us here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.400 
phase so what we've got behind us here
is<00:00:12.620> we've<00:00:13.620> gone<00:00:13.799> through<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:15.379> couple<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
is we've gone through with a couple of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
is we've gone through with a couple of
passes<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.039> rotary<00:00:17.880> hoe<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> we've

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
passes with the rotary hoe and we've

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.710 
passes with the rotary hoe and we've
been<00:00:18.779> able<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.109> incorporate<00:00:19.699> all<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
been able to incorporate all that that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
been able to incorporate all that that
green<00:00:21.960> cane<00:00:22.260> trash<00:00:22.560> blanket<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> ground

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
green cane trash blanket into the ground

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.300 
green cane trash blanket into the ground
and<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.930> you've<00:00:25.619> done<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.830> reasonable

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and you think you've done a reasonable

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700 
and you think you've done a reasonable
job<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.970> we've<00:00:27.570> still<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:28.109> some<00:00:28.500> fairly

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
job but we've still got some some fairly

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189 
job but we've still got some some fairly
big<00:00:28.949> lumps<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.580> soil<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.539> massive<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
big lumps of soil that are massive you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
big lumps of soil that are massive you
can<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.520> rotary<00:00:33.149> hoe<00:00:33.270> slice<00:00:33.660> through

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
can see the the rotary hoe slice through

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
can see the the rotary hoe slice through
there<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:35.100> another<00:00:35.280> slice<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.350> back

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
there and had another slice out the back

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.130 
there and had another slice out the back
but<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> soil<00:00:38.700> hasn't<00:00:39.090> hasn't<00:00:39.360> fractured<00:00:40.050> at

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
but that soil hasn't hasn't fractured at

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.010 
but that soil hasn't hasn't fractured at
all<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.329> fairly<00:00:42.329> compressed<00:00:42.870> from

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
all because it is fairly compressed from

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
all because it is fairly compressed from
the<00:00:43.170> harvester<00:00:43.590> traffic<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the harvester traffic now you have a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.790 
the harvester traffic now you have a
look<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.110> at<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> saw<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> bottom

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
look at the at the saw at the bottom

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
look at the at the saw at the bottom
here<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.520> where<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> where<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
here you can see where the where the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
here you can see where the where the
rotary<00:00:49.350> hoe<00:00:49.500> blades<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.820> been

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
rotary hoe blades have have been

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650 
rotary hoe blades have have been
operating<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> next<00:00:53.730> thing<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> try<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
operating so the next thing to try and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.709 
operating so the next thing to try and
do<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> bit<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> repair<00:00:55.789> phase<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> bring

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
do a bit of a repair phase is to bring

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.650 
do a bit of a repair phase is to bring
in<00:00:57.840> something<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.320> a<00:01:00.350> sub<00:01:01.350> sorting<00:01:01.770> gripper

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
in something like a sub sorting gripper

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.520 
in something like a sub sorting gripper
again<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> end<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> day<00:01:04.260> we'll<00:01:04.500> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
again at the end of the day we'll be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
again at the end of the day we'll be
doing<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.850> amount<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> remedying<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
doing an amount of remedying the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.030 
doing an amount of remedying the
situation<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.299> realistically<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
situation here but realistically if we

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.230 
situation here but realistically if we
could<00:01:11.250> keep<00:01:11.430> traffic<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> beds<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
could keep traffic off of the beds the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
could keep traffic off of the beds the
crop<00:01:15.240> crop<00:01:15.420> growing<00:01:15.720> area<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
crop crop growing area and just that the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
crop crop growing area and just that the
plant<00:01:18.119> roots<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.990> through<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.560> work<00:01:19.710> through

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
plant roots go through and work through

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
plant roots go through and work through
the<00:01:20.009> soil<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.369> achieve<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.180> than

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the soil would achieve a lot more than

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320 
the soil would achieve a lot more than
what<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.540> ever<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:23.009> something<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
what we ever can with something like a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.660 
what we ever can with something like a
ripper<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.080> invest<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.530> awful<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> time

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
ripper we invest an awful lot of time

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
ripper we invest an awful lot of time
and<00:01:26.850> energy<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.229> I'll<00:01:28.350> show

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and energy you know it and as I'll show

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
and energy you know it and as I'll show
you<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.130> probably<00:01:29.369> don't<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.880> get

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you over here we probably don't do get

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.890 
you over here we probably don't do get
to<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> depth<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.900> have

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to the depth that we think we have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
to the depth that we think we have
achieved<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.619> done<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> job<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.280> we'd<00:01:35.430> like

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
achieved and done the job that we'd like

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.980 
achieved and done the job that we'd like
to<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.850> done<00:01:36.030> or

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.300 

so<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.290> type<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.530> energy<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:43.190> we

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so this is the type of energy that we

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.330 
so this is the type of energy that we
need<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.610> invest<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> ground<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.160> duck

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
need to invest in to the ground to duck

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.580 
need to invest in to the ground to duck
to<00:01:46.640> turn<00:01:47.030> get<00:01:47.450> rid<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.780> compaction<00:01:48.140> I'd

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
to turn get rid of that compaction I'd

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.440 
to turn get rid of that compaction I'd
like<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.460> these<00:01:49.730> in<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> little<00:01:50.270> bit

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
like to have these in a little bit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.780 
like to have these in a little bit
deeper<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:50.990> we<00:01:51.230> may<00:01:51.380> have<00:01:51.410> trash<00:01:52.370> that's<00:01:52.640> in

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
deeper but we may have trash that's in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.180 
deeper but we may have trash that's in
the<00:01:52.880> soil<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.650> can't<00:01:54.650> actually<00:01:54.830> get<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.160> to

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190
