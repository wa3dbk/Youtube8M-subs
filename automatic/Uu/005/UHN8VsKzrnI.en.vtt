00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.990 
off you're gonna fold it back like this
and<00:01:54.770> now<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.159> said<00:01:56.250> pretend<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

and now like I said pretend this is the
ace<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.899> gonna<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> red

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
ace and this is gonna be one of the red

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
ace and this is gonna be one of the red
kings<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> you're<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.210> position<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
kings for you you're gonna position it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
kings for you you're gonna position it
on<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> card<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:04.049> about<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:05.210> okay<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
on the card like just about that okay so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
on the card like just about that okay so
it<00:02:06.719> looks<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> cards<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.619> fanned

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it looks like the cards are fanned

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.999 
it looks like the cards are fanned
diagonally<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.929> there's<00:02:10.530> still<00:02:10.709> space<00:02:10.950> for

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
diagonally but there's still space for

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.280 
diagonally but there's still space for
the<00:02:11.489> Joker<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> fit<00:02:12.420> underneath

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the Joker to fit underneath

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.080 
the Joker to fit underneath
and<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.920> also<00:02:14.069> important<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:14.700> edges

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and it's also important that this edges

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.729 
and it's also important that this edges
not<00:02:15.239> hang<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.629> because<00:02:15.900> when<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> cartridge

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
not hang out because when the cartridge

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
not hang out because when the cartridge
is<00:02:16.950> turned<00:02:17.459> over<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.790> has<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:18.120> look<00:02:18.239> like<00:02:18.329> one

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
is turned over it has to look like one

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.440 
is turned over it has to look like one
card<00:02:19.099> okay<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.519> obviously<00:02:20.849> readjust

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
card okay so you can obviously readjust

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
you want it to look just like that so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.509 
you want it to look just like that so
the<00:02:26.790> card<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.409> diagonal<00:02:28.409> because<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.280> want<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
Joker's top edge is aligned with the top

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.770 
Joker's top edge is aligned with the top
edge<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> ace<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.450> has<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.690> be

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
edge of the ace now it has to be

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.869 
edge of the ace now it has to be
perfectly<00:02:49.200> aligned<00:02:49.530> because<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.670> too

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
perfectly aligned because if it's too

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.180 
perfectly aligned because if it's too
low<00:02:51.260> when<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.349> spread<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.739> cards<00:02:52.950> with<00:02:53.099> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
low when you spread the cards with the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.399 
low when you spread the cards with the
king<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.849> spectator<00:02:54.690> will<00:02:54.810> notice<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
king the spectator will notice that this

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.170 
king the spectator will notice that this
edge<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> lot<00:02:56.129> lower<00:02:56.340> than<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.730> edge<00:02:56.940> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
edge is a lot lower than this edge so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.270 
edge is a lot lower than this edge so
they'll<00:02:57.690> know<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:57.989> not<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.290> same<00:02:58.440> card<00:02:58.769> and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
they'll know it's not the same card and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.309 
they'll know it's not the same card and
if<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.819> too<00:03:00.000> high<00:03:00.209> quite<00:03:00.599> obviously<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.170> can

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
if it's too high quite obviously you can

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.559 
if it's too high quite obviously you can
see<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> Joker<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.639> make<00:03:02.819> sure<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.299> top

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
see the Joker so make sure that the top

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.180 
see the Joker so make sure that the top
edge<00:03:03.599> of<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.959> flap<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> completely<00:03:04.889> aligned

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
edge of the flap is completely aligned

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.170 
edge of the flap is completely aligned
with<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> Joker<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:06.409> like<00:03:07.409> that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
with the Joker just like that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
with the Joker just like that
okay<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:09.420> you're<00:03:09.510> going<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.690> take<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> King

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
okay then you're going to take the King

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.050 
okay then you're going to take the King
and<00:03:10.440> you're<00:03:10.739> gonna<00:03:10.829> place<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.159> in<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.609> way<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and you're gonna place it in a way that

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.910 
and you're gonna place it in a way that
makes<00:03:12.299> these<00:03:12.930> three<00:03:13.260> cards<00:03:13.560> look<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.859> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
makes these three cards look like a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.470 
makes these three cards look like a
natural<00:03:14.099> spread<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.849> don't<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:15.389> be
