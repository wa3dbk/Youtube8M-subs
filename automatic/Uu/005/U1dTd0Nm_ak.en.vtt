doesn't<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.890> we're

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
doesn't it and I think that we're

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.139 
doesn't it and I think that we're
finally<00:00:59.250> reaching<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.699> point<00:00:59.940> where

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
finally reaching the point where

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.520

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
graphics aren't the only thing that's
cutting<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.190> battlefield<00:01:02.760> 3

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
cutting it and I think battlefield 3

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.390 
cutting it and I think battlefield 3
started<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.129> not

more<00:02:39.810> successful<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:41.459> personally<00:02:42.209> I

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
more successful because personally I

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.600 
more successful because personally I
think<00:02:42.360> they<00:02:42.720> didn't<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.440> until<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.310> think

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
think they didn't up until now I think

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.080 
think they didn't up until now I think
that<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.880> didn't<00:02:45.209> really<00:02:45.360> matter<00:02:45.690> how<00:02:46.110> crazy

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
that it didn't really matter how crazy

the<00:02:51.660> last<00:02:51.870> five<00:02:52.110> years<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the last five years I think that the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.830 
the last five years I think that the
main<00:02:53.220> reason<00:02:53.280> people<00:02:53.700> ball<00:02:54.150> games<00:02:54.510> was

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
main reason people ball games was

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
main reason people ball games was
because<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.290> looks<00:02:55.530> pretty<00:02:55.709> there's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> really

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
because it looks pretty there's a really

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.520 
because it looks pretty there's a really
good<00:02:56.850> reason<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> reason<00:02:58.410> I'm

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
good reason for this to the reason I'm

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.380 
good reason for this to the reason I'm
not<00:02:58.560> saying<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.220> five<00:02:59.459> years<00:02:59.730> ago<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.150> guys

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the reason I'm saying this now and not

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.770 
the reason I'm saying this now and not
five<00:03:07.830> years<00:03:08.040> ago<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.820> because<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.360> get<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
five years ago it's because you get to a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.590 
five years ago it's because you get to a
point<00:03:10.140> um<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:11.340> all<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.550> economic<00:03:12.120> majors<00:03:12.480> you

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
point um for all you economic majors you

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.790 
point um for all you economic majors you
guys<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:12.840> gonna<00:03:12.930> love<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.620> called

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
guys are gonna love this it's called

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.890 
guys are gonna love this it's called
diminishing<00:03:14.430> return<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.150> when<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.690> do

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
diminishing return so when you do

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.190 
diminishing return so when you do
something<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.610> much<00:03:17.940> them<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
something so so much them you know the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
something so so much them you know the
more<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.829> do<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.220> less<00:03:20.760> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
more and more you do it the less and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.810 
more and more you do it the less and
less<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:22.079> games<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.190> guess<00:03:23.489> another

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
less the games are so I guess another

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.150 
less the games are so I guess another
way<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> look<00:03:24.209> at<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.620> start<00:03:25.680> out

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
way to look at it is when you start out

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.539 
way to look at it is when you start out
with<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.489> original<00:03:27.239> palm<00:03:28.170> right<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:29.070> Atari

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
with the original palm right on on Atari

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.240 
with the original palm right on on Atari
and<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.269> two<00:03:30.630> white<00:03:31.049> blocks<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.799> pixel

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
and you have two white blocks in a pixel

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.520 
and you have two white blocks in a pixel
ball<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.820> bounces<00:03:33.299> back<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.989> forth<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
ball that it bounces back and forth and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.860 
ball that it bounces back and forth and
then<00:03:35.130> when<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.489> make<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> graphical<00:03:36.390> update

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
then when you make a graphical update

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
then when you make a graphical update
let's<00:03:37.320> say<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> couple<00:03:37.920> generations<00:03:38.160> later

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
let's say a couple generations later

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.390 
let's say a couple generations later
something<00:03:39.540> we've<00:03:39.660> got<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.019> n64<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:41.010> 3d

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
something we've got the n64 with 3d

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.670 
something we've got the n64 with 3d
rendered<00:03:41.820> shit<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:42.570> like<00:03:42.750> oh<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.290> god

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
rendered shit and it's like oh my god

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.590 
rendered shit and it's like oh my god
this<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.040> amazing<00:03:44.340> by<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.120> way<00:03:45.239> we're<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.570> in

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
this is amazing by the way we're back in

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.380 
this is amazing by the way we're back in
battlefield<00:03:46.200> 3<00:03:46.260> anyways<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.400> gain<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:48.000> so

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
battlefield 3 anyways the gain is so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.140 
battlefield 3 anyways the gain is so
large<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.290> what<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.070> used<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> render<00:03:50.700> people

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
large and what we used to render people

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.090 
large and what we used to render people
it's<00:03:51.269> called<00:03:51.450> polygons<00:03:51.959> right<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.890> amount

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's called polygons right so the amount

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's called polygons right so the amount
of<00:03:53.160> polygons<00:03:53.700> usually<00:03:54.180> determines<00:03:54.690> how<00:03:54.840> good

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
of polygons usually determines how good

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.750 
of polygons usually determines how good
the<00:03:55.290> game<00:03:55.440> looks<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.950> more<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.280> better<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the game looks the more the better and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.420 
the game looks the more the better and
the<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.019> diminishing<00:03:58.590> returns<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.280> is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the the diminishing returns in this is

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.160 
the the diminishing returns in this is
that<00:03:59.850> we've<00:04:00.000> reached<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.360> point<00:04:00.390> where<00:04:00.750> there's

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that we've reached a point where there's

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
that we've reached a point where there's
only<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.530> much<00:04:01.650> more<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.519> make

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
only so much more you can do to make

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.370 
only so much more you can do to make
your<00:04:02.820> game<00:04:03.030> look<00:04:03.299> good<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.989> if<00:04:04.049> we<00:04:04.140> look<00:04:04.170> at

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
your game look good so if we look at

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.220 
your game look good so if we look at
battlefield<00:04:04.739> 3<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.370> console<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.360> was<00:04:06.840> limited

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
battlefield 3 on console it was limited

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.220 
battlefield 3 on console it was limited
by<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.410> graphical<00:04:08.220> okay<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.480> capabilities

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
by the graphical okay the capabilities

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.440 
by the graphical okay the capabilities
of<00:04:10.260> its<00:04:10.530> graphical<00:04:10.980> processor<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.760> ps3<00:04:12.329> in

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
of its graphical processor in the ps3 in

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.660 
of its graphical processor in the ps3 in
the<00:04:12.540> xbox<00:04:13.019> which<00:04:13.230> are<00:04:13.440> pretty<00:04:13.650> mediocre<00:04:13.859> and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
the xbox which are pretty mediocre and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.460 
the xbox which are pretty mediocre and
yet<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.970> still<00:04:15.209> looks<00:04:15.450> good<00:04:15.630> but<00:04:16.229> look<00:04:16.350> at

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
yet it still looks good but look at

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.979 
yet it still looks good but look at
battlefield<00:04:16.859> 4<00:04:17.220> as<00:04:17.430> amazing<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.600> looks

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
battlefield 4 as amazing as it looks

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.469 
battlefield 4 as amazing as it looks
it's<00:04:19.289> not<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.950> taking<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.580> picture<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.419> a

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
it's not like taking a picture of a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.629 
it's not like taking a picture of a
PlayStation<00:04:22.380> 2<00:04:22.620> game<00:04:22.650> and

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
PlayStation 2 game and

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.670 
PlayStation 2 game and
taking<00:04:23.969> a<00:04:24.060> picture<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.539> battlefield<00:04:24.960> 3<00:04:25.259> it's

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
taking a picture of battlefield 3 it's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.830 
taking a picture of battlefield 3 it's
not<00:04:25.889> like<00:04:26.189> that<00:04:26.219> at<00:04:26.639> all<00:04:26.819> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.599> there's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
not like that at all and then there's

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.570 
not like that at all and then there's
there's<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.199> reason<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.310> it's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
there's a reason that is and it's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.070 
there's a reason that is and it's
because<00:04:29.879> that<00:04:30.060> there's<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.330> only<00:04:30.569> so<00:04:30.900> much

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
because that there's just only so much

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.300 
because that there's just only so much
that<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.349> can<00:04:31.469> do<00:04:31.590> before<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.009> get<00:04:32.159> to<00:04:32.279> a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
that you can do before you get to a

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.040 
that you can do before you get to a
point<00:04:32.580> where<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.939> visual<00:04:33.360> effects<00:04:33.689> are<00:04:33.870> not

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
point where the visual effects are not

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.350 
point where the visual effects are not
noticeable<00:04:34.710> as<00:04:34.830> much<00:04:35.039> and<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.909> reason<00:04:36.090> I'm

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
noticeable as much and the reason I'm

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.850 
noticeable as much and the reason I'm
saying<00:04:36.509> this<00:04:36.629> now<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.139> because<00:04:37.289> we<00:04:37.499> finally

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
saying this now is because we finally

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.890 
saying this now is because we finally
reached<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:38.279> point<00:04:38.490> where<00:04:38.610> graphical<00:04:39.419> updates

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
reached a point where graphical updates

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.409 
reached a point where graphical updates
aren't<00:04:40.259> exactly<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.919> ultimate<00:04:41.430> thing<00:04:41.669> like

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
aren't exactly the ultimate thing like

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.059 
aren't exactly the ultimate thing like
it's<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.080> shouldn't<00:04:43.499> be<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.740> be-all<00:04:43.919> end-all

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
it's it shouldn't be the be-all end-all

dust doesn't come up from the ground
when<00:05:15.479> you<00:05:15.569> run<00:05:15.750> it's<00:05:15.990> just<00:05:16.259> you<00:05:16.560> build<00:05:17.009> shit

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
when you run it's just you build shit

and<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:17.729> fun<00:05:18.029> so<00:05:18.839> where<00:05:19.139> is<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:19.439> in<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.219> list

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and it's fun so where is it in the list

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.339 
and it's fun so where is it in the list
of<00:05:20.669> things<00:05:20.729> that<00:05:21.270> we're<00:05:21.419> looking<00:05:21.719> at<00:05:21.870> that

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
of things that we're looking at that

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.649 
of things that we're looking at that
that<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.949> know<00:05:23.099> graphics<00:05:24.089> takes<00:05:24.330> a<00:05:24.449> backseat

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
that you know graphics takes a backseat

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.869 
that you know graphics takes a backseat
when<00:05:25.139> does<00:05:25.319> that<00:05:25.349> happen<00:05:25.499> and<00:05:26.189> I<00:05:26.520> think<00:05:26.580> it's

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
when does that happen and I think it's

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:27.950 
when does that happen and I think it's
happening<00:05:27.210> with<00:05:27.300> battle<00:05:27.569> for<00:05:27.659> you<00:05:27.719> for<00:05:27.930> I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
happening with battle for you for I

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.689 
happening with battle for you for I
really<00:05:28.050> do<00:05:28.529> I<00:05:28.560> think<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.069> it's<00:05:29.219> starting<00:05:29.610> to

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
really do I think that it's starting to

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.490 
really do I think that it's starting to
happen<00:05:29.849> I<00:05:30.180> think<00:05:30.389> it's<00:05:30.509> gonna<00:05:30.629> start<00:05:30.990> paving

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
happen I think it's gonna start paving

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.170 
happen I think it's gonna start paving
the<00:05:31.740> way<00:05:31.830> for<00:05:31.979> more<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.520> more<00:05:32.669> interactive

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
the way for more and more interactive

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.179 
the way for more and more interactive
environments<00:05:33.689> because<00:05:33.779> battlefield<00:05:34.409> 4<00:05:34.650> has<00:05:34.919> I

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
environments because battlefield 4 has I

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.890 
environments because battlefield 4 has I
think<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.939> like<00:05:36.089> every<00:05:36.419> building<00:05:36.719> can<00:05:36.870> be

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
think it's like every building can be

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.809 
think it's like every building can be
blown<00:05:37.229> up<00:05:37.259> right<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:38.039> can<00:05:38.189> take<00:05:38.370> out<00:05:38.550> calm

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
blown up right you can take out calm

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.269 
blown up right you can take out calm
stations<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.599> you<00:05:39.960> can<00:05:40.110> take<00:05:40.259> out<00:05:40.469> bham<00:05:40.830> bham

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
stations and you can take out bham bham

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.029 
stations and you can take out bham bham
planning<00:05:41.819> sites<00:05:42.569> with<00:05:43.110> destroying<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
planning sites with destroying the

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.379 
planning sites with destroying the
building<00:05:44.399> it's<00:05:44.550> been<00:05:44.639> that<00:05:44.939> way<00:05:44.969> for<00:05:45.089> a<00:05:45.360> while

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
building it's been that way for a while

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.749 
building it's been that way for a while
and<00:05:45.870> now<00:05:46.289> they're<00:05:46.439> just<00:05:46.469> vamping<00:05:47.279> it<00:05:47.399> up<00:05:47.550> there

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
and now they're just vamping it up there

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.760 
and now they're just vamping it up there
making<00:05:47.909> it<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:48.389> when<00:05:48.659> a<00:05:48.689> building<00:05:48.930> blows<00:05:49.289> up<00:05:49.349> it

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
making it so when a building blows up it

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.170 
making it so when a building blows up it
doesn't<00:05:49.889> blow<00:05:50.219> up<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.490> same<00:05:50.729> way<00:05:50.759> anymore

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
doesn't blow up the same way anymore

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.510 
doesn't blow up the same way anymore
what<00:05:51.719> I<00:05:51.750> mean<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.080> say<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:52.439> that<00:05:52.620> I'm<00:05:52.949> excited

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
what I mean to say is that I'm excited

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.550 
what I mean to say is that I'm excited
for<00:05:53.550> this<00:05:53.759> next<00:05:53.969> generation<00:05:54.300> because<00:05:54.960> it

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
for this next generation because it

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.679 
for this next generation because it
means<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:56.009> no<00:05:56.339> longer<00:05:56.610> do<00:05:56.879> we<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:57.149> rely

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
means that no longer do we have to rely

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.409 
means that no longer do we have to rely
on<00:05:57.719> just<00:05:58.139> pretty-looking<00:05:58.800> games<00:05:59.310> maybe<00:06:00.060> now

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
on just pretty-looking games maybe now

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.179 
on just pretty-looking games maybe now
game<00:06:00.960> developers<00:06:01.469> are<00:06:01.560> gonna<00:06:01.649> start<00:06:01.949> focusing

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
game developers are gonna start focusing

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.399 
game developers are gonna start focusing
on<00:06:02.639> something<00:06:02.849> we<00:06:03.060> like<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.270> call<00:06:03.389> gameplay<00:06:04.080> or

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
on something we like to call gameplay or

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.619 
on something we like to call gameplay or
the<00:06:05.339> thing<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:05.789> keeps<00:06:06.029> you<00:06:06.210> playing<00:06:06.360> the

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629 
the thing that keeps you playing the

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.709 
the thing that keeps you playing the
game<00:06:06.889> visuals<00:06:07.889> are<00:06:08.129> good<00:06:08.430> but<00:06:09.180> gameplay<00:06:09.659> is

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
game visuals are good but gameplay is

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.329 
game visuals are good but gameplay is
more<00:06:09.990> important<00:06:10.469> so<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.889> guess<00:06:10.949> that's<00:06:11.159> gonna

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
more important so I guess that's gonna

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.219 
more important so I guess that's gonna
wrap<00:06:11.610> things<00:06:11.849> up<00:06:12.000> for<00:06:12.060> me<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.539> really<00:06:12.599> want<00:06:13.199> to
