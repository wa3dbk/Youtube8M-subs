00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.180
 hello today we are going to prepare a dish that 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.719
 can serve us either for dessert or for 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.490
 garnishing a carrot flan we are going to 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.209
 put also a glass of milk and two 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.840
 eggs 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.730
 let's start 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.410
 the first thing that is going to be once 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.140
 we have clean and peeled the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.990
 carrots expose them to the pan for 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.869
 boil, wash them to boil using 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.550
 the milk if you see that there was a glass not 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.590
 come to cover everything you can add 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.540
 a little bit more and we put it to boil 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.160
 slow fire you have to be careful that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.809
 do not burn because the milk as you know 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.520
 they are very fast, you have to be 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.170
 controlling what 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 and we have added a little more milk 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.740
 and now what we are going to do is before 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.040
 put to boil we are going to add a 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.350
 little salt and a little bit of pepper 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.690
 and one said we make it boiled 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.970
 let's go through the blender we're going to 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.790
 put them all in the glass leaving aside 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.650
 the milk and we're going to beat it 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.570
 the texture we want to achieve is 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.090
 looked like a cream so if we see that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.170
 lack a little bit of liquidity like 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.170
 we throw is a little milk 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.140
 we have to wait for it to cool the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.780
 cream because now what are we going to do 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.909
 is to beat the eggs and then mix it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.189
 everything if we did it with the cream yet 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.469
 warm the egg to curdle and what 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.579
 would make it look like an omelet like that 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.649
 let's give it time to cool 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.759
 while we beat the two eggs and if 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.250
 we see that it is not yet enough 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.140
 cold what we're going to do is put it in 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 a jar of cold water to lower the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 temperature 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.950
 once we have beaten the eggs and 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.760
 it is cold the cream we add it and what 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.760
 we beat everything again 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 you have to get the result to be 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.810
 as homogeneous as possible 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.760
 a scale we already have everything that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.710
 let's do is put the edges 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.220
 we have relied on the molds of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.930
 silicone 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.180
 and then to fill in with it 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.490
 once we have all the molds 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.880
 fillings we are going to cover the water 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 container up to half the height 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 just half of the mold we leave it 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.350
 Now what are we going to do that is 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.430
 put it in the oven to put it in the bathroom 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.290
 Maria will take about 15 or 20 minutes 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.150
 we go to controlling once what 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.799
 put in the oven the consistency and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.920
 once we see what is left as a 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.840
 flan is the time to remove them and from this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 so simple way we have done this 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.219
 dish that as you know at the beginning we 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.359
 can serve as dessert or garnish 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.650
