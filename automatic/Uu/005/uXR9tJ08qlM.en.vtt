numbers<00:01:07.380> early<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> game<00:01:08.219> so<00:01:09.140> that's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
numbers early on in the game so that's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.830 
numbers early on in the game so that's
good<00:01:10.580> next<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.820> run<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:13.400> cookies<00:01:14.570> only<00:01:15.570> three

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
good next I run three cookies only three

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.039 
good next I run three cookies only three
because<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.670> main<00:01:17.820> reason<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> she<00:01:18.600> run<00:01:18.750> her<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because the main reason I she run her is

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.010 
because the main reason I she run her is
because<00:01:19.710> she<00:01:19.830> works<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
because she works really well with the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
because she works really well with the
cream<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.380> means<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.010> can<00:01:26.130> swing<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.430> 21

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cream so that means you can swing for 21

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.240 
cream so that means you can swing for 21
on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> side<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> know

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
on the side and that really you know

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.859 
on the side and that really you know
puts<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> pressure<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.510> opponent

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
puts a lot of pressure on your opponent

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
puts a lot of pressure on your opponent
and<00:01:31.549> when<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> write<00:01:32.850> her<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.390> very

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and when you write her it's also very

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
and when you write her it's also very
good<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.520> draw<00:01:35.520> two<00:01:35.580> cards<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
good because you can draw two cards and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.039 
good because you can draw two cards and
that<00:01:36.540> discard<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.409> card<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that discard one card so it's kind of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.890 
that discard one card so it's kind of
like<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> tsukiyomi<00:01:40.740> except<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:42.080> that's<00:01:43.080> good

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.140 

next<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:49.439> run<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:51.650> macro<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.909> she's<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
next we run for macro because she's a

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.240 
next we run for macro because she's a
