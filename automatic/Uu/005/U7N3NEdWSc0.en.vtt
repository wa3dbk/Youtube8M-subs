00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.449
 or the vall genera and bastoneras I am 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.219
 josema source and this is des manÃ­a bueno 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.190
 in the writing we have gone to the 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:04.000
 outside to test this bicycle a 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.250
 27 and a half the savannah venture a first 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 price on carbon that will not stop 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.179
 indifferent to anyone if something has 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 surprised of this box is his 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.580
 tremendous rigidity and there 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.940
 they contribute a lot of braces and sheaths and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 a triangular section 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.680
 in this case we have a bottom bracket 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 conventional threads of all the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 life of those that work 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 if there is something to thank the brand is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.390
 that comes with a complete review 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.120
 There is extraordinary as always 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 brakes exists in this case we have the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.700
 lever the regulation dial of the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.490
 reach lever that we are going to put 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 always at the perfect height of our 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.829
 finger 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.130
 and as not infinite power at the time of 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.600
 slow and great modularity the triggers 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.619
 There is also a derailleur 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.090
 rear change plates and sprockets 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.530
 in this case 11 pinions 11 the small 32 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.420
 the big one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.190
 and against what he's already saying 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 usual on most bicycles 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 that carry double plate or just one 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 savannah this adventure dish was going to triple 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.209
 dish a few covers tremendously 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.350
 rollers as are the continental ones king 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.420
 skin measure 2.2 garcia comes hand in hand 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.920
 rock shox 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.420
 in this case the 30 with remote lock 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.910
 mechanic from the handlebar 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.300
 the saddle is a comfortable seat sanmarco 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.780
 Protect model with anti cleavage 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.910
 prostate 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.370
 the handlebar power the seatpost 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.350
 saddle of the brand efe s / a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.350
 in this case the cut force models 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.219
 and the wheels come in charge in this case 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.609
 of mavic about 2 wright here do not fail 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:02.470
 it's never absolute reliability this 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.330
 type of mobile wheels 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.120
 I know to highlight something from this sheet 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.970
 adventure is above all the rigidity of its 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.160
 picture give pedals about it is 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.710
 automatically translated into progress 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.030
 immediately return a bike that you'll 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.590
 be able to do any march 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 cyclotourist of which we are plagued 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.310
 in our country with full guarantee and 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.490
 to enjoy without limits the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.870
 tripe dish will give you a plus to the 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.360
 time to face especially the big 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.490
 steep slopes and the big ramps that you 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.110
 you can find we had already 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.870
 practically forgotten what a 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.540
 triple dish but it has returned us to 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.700
 surprise let's say for the great 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.750
 Most users are usually the option 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.280
 more valid and that more options gives you 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.410
 those who are always a little 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.090
 stronger evidently a double plate 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.280
 you will amplify much more the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.230
 transmission 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 highlight above all also the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.400
 xt transmission in full is 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.040
 possibly the relationship group receives 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.310
 quality performance better than there is in 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 the market 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.219
 good there are bayonets trails this has 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.859
 been the savannah venture that has 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.970
 liked here in the relationship a picture of 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.480
 first carbon price of 27 and a half 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.520
 josema source and see you in a next 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.580
 test mania 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.580
 ah
