profile<00:00:23.189> that's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.730> parabolic<00:00:24.090> rocker

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
profile that's a parabolic rocker

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060 
profile that's a parabolic rocker
actually<00:00:25.109> there's<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> lot<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> rocker<00:00:25.949> in

actually there's a lot of rocker in

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.620 
actually there's a lot of rocker in
between<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.580> feet<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> rocker

between your feet and the rocker

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
between your feet and the rocker
actually<00:00:28.050> tapers<00:00:28.529> down<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.189> closer

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
actually tapers down as you get closer

towards<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> tips<00:00:30.689> meaning<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.679> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
towards the tips meaning that when you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
towards the tips meaning that when you
set<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.309> flat<00:00:32.579> ground<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:32.969> going

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
set this thing on flat ground it's going

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790 
set this thing on flat ground it's going
to<00:00:33.180> Teeter<00:00:33.390> totters<00:00:33.750> quite<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> bit<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to Teeter totters quite a bit and the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.139 
to Teeter totters quite a bit and the
nose<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.190> tail<00:00:35.309> sections<00:00:35.489> will<00:00:35.820> actually<00:00:36.059> be

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
nose and tail sections will actually be

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.080 
nose and tail sections will actually be
somewhat<00:00:36.870> flat<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.770> arbor<00:00:38.460> calls<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.910> thing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
somewhat flat now arbor calls this thing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.510 
somewhat flat now arbor calls this thing
am<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.480> mountain<00:00:39.930> twin<00:00:40.469> i'm<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.430> sure

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
am a mountain twin i'm not really sure

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000 
am a mountain twin i'm not really sure
if<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.050> what<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.140> mean<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
if that is what they mean by that is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
if that is what they mean by that is
that<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> true<00:00:45.719> twin

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that it's kind of not really a true twin

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.690 
that it's kind of not really a true twin
but<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> look<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> spec<00:00:46.980> sheet<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
but when you look at the spec sheet it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
but when you look at the spec sheet it
looks<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.300> twin<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
looks like a two twin now then I was in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709 
looks like a two twin now then I was in
Taylors<00:00:49.469> same<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.879> stance<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> centered

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Taylors same with the stance is centered

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
Taylors same with the stance is centered
and<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.770> tell<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.520> radius<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and from what I can tell the radius of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.119 
and from what I can tell the radius of
the<00:00:54.629> side<00:00:54.809> cut<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> centered<00:00:55.800> within<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the side cut is centered within the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.920 
the side cut is centered within the
stance<00:00:56.370> too

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
stance too

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
stance too
this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> true<00:00:59.370> twin<00:00:59.550> board<00:00:59.609> just

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this is I think a true twin board just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
this is I think a true twin board just
meant<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.660> Mountain<00:01:01.170> riding<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.949> what's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
meant for all Mountain riding now what's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.560 
meant for all Mountain riding now what's
cool<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.120> thing<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
cool about this thing is that it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.600 
cool about this thing is that it
actually<00:01:04.049> has<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:05.100> great<00:01:05.250> flex

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually has a a pretty great flex

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520 
actually has a a pretty great flex
rating<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.450> even<00:01:06.750> though<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> does<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
rating now even though it does have that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
rating now even though it does have that
parabolic<00:01:08.040> rocker<00:01:08.340> profile<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> seems<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
parabolic rocker profile it seems to be

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
parabolic rocker profile it seems to be
a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.780> stiffer<00:01:10.020> than<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.380> let's<00:01:10.799> say

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
a little bit stiffer than that let's say

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
a little bit stiffer than that let's say
right<00:01:11.280> around<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.909> 5<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
right around a 5 and that's because of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
right around a 5 and that's because of
the<00:01:13.860> bamboo<00:01:14.040> wood<00:01:14.220> Corp<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.360> poplar<00:01:15.720> wood

the bamboo wood Corp and the poplar wood
within<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> core<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.770> mixed<00:01:17.159> laminates

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
within the core it's mixed laminates

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.749 
within the core it's mixed laminates
that<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.930> mix<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.619> glass<00:01:20.130> too<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
by axe glass and then of course there's
going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> hand<00:01:26.880> dyed<00:01:27.150> black<00:01:27.810> ash<00:01:28.140> power

this<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.329> does<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.619> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> its
