00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:10.910
 Zdarova with you Palawan I'm going 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:14.530
 make a simulator i.e. take the panel 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:20.180
 out to do on this one 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:24.830
 the nightstand is shorter well this seems for ets2 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:31.130
 for from cancer and eurotrac a for kamaz or 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:36.440
 there scania volvo but no matter shorter i 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:42.620
 I want to make here the panel I took how many 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:49.239
 4 panel speedometer so on panel 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.239
 all costs 40 cairo euros 40 euros panel 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.520
 speedometer with tachometer 35 euro steering 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.360
 speaker 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:07.430
 so I was given in addition to the panel 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:13.120
 that is, I went behind the panel and it turned out 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.100
 that the seller also has a steering column 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:32.860
 Here is such a right speaker who is a 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:32.860
 golf excluded even include like this 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.100
 maybe someone will ask as this 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.960
 everything will work well here this is all 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 button switches here this dissidents 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.900
 I will tell her to get this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.670
 buttons social network buttons from the panel worked 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:01.470
 In the game for this you need, that's how I already 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 showed such a fee, it is shorter 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.890
 rework signals when two wires 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.860
 close it reworks the signal as 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.300
 as if you press a button on the keyboard 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.090
 well, that is clear there plus with minus 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.490
 it is therefore here a switch so and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 plugged it in there two wires crossed 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.800
 these two wires go to this board and this one 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.070
 fee then 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.300
 connected to computer via wesby 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.769
 and there is a program for that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.510
 she remakes these signals as if 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.070
 as if at the touch of a button that is, she 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:51.690
 says what type is there and since button b 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:54.600
 the face here of course there can be later in the game 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.269
 change everything there and arrows 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.269
 worked the speedometer arrows there 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:09.739
 spidan tachometer there is everything else 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.739
 for this another board needed 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.329
 food parcel was waiting for a week she came 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:25.690
 this is the personal english queen and 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:29.710
 hell shorter 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:36.640
 now unpack 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.640
 they need such a board there 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540
 I 'll open it now 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.950
 here is the payment 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.300
 pay 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.550
 Now this page is worth anyone interested 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:13.320
 this is the board here the block is connected in front 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:16.840
 power is vesbi 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:22.560
 it is connected by computer and here it is 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.560
 give or take well 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.930
 here minuses and so on rpn spd 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.680
 This type of lpm is the momentum from under this 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:43.490
 speedometer and all other sensors 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.120
 connect here but it is calculated well 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.120
 yes they have there and the page is worth it 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.640

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.320
 there is for ps2 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:00.520
 Well, since there is already a mod for multiplayer 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.960
