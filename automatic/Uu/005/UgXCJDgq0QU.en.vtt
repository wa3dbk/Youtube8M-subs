 thanks to wheat flour 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.080
 the necessary consistency of the test is necessary 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 add some more water otherwise it 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.429

 when the ingredients are mixed 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 the dough is sucked out of the bowl by pump 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:03.610
 mixer dispenser and poured small 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 portions of dough on a moving conveyor 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.920
 now they look like regular cookies 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.349
 this is a true prediction pipeline 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.659
 hot mold drop onto dough 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.500
 shape it and make cookies 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.500

 it was easy to change shape to the following 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.800
 stage cooking steel hooks 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:03:01.900
 puts a piece of paper with predictions in 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:03.850
 cookies and give it a butterfly shape 5000 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.240
 various predictions can be found in 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.270
 cookie how much thought is invested 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.490

 conveyor 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:39.650
 there is a special mechanism that packs them 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:51.319

 many conveyors come together 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.459

 cookies removing excess volume 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:40.499
 on the conveyor belt box drives 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.189
 under the metal rail which and and 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.189
 shut down 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:56.870
