00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.240
 hello before showing you the video about 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.160
 the course of vertical ecosystems that 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.600
 we have taught in argentina wanted 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.309
 make a short paragraph to tell you about 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.680
 this phenomenon that is happening in 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.890
 internet with these companies that arise 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.689
 spontaneously with the intention of 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.660
 sell courses to sell gardens 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.630
 vertical and so on are only three points 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.930
 to take into account to be able to differentiate 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.670
 If those companies interest us or not only 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.399
 one is that those companies and their 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.830
 representatives must be people who 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.100
 give the face people with whom you can 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.550
 contact through the different ways either 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.500
 skype phone email that they give the face not 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.690
 have a professional career 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.810
 that can really prove who 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.720
 they are and the trajectory that they have two is 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.750
 that these companies have jobs 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.490
 a portfolio of creditable jobs that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 can show that those jobs are 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.829
 theirs that are not images seized of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 internet or photomontage of photoshop or 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.659
 to get images to us like 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.020
 is happening in some cases not 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.090
 3 is that those those vertical gardens 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.799
 that they promise to have done they have to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.350
 show you not only once 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.380
 executed but at least six months 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.509
 later not to be able to see if that work 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.969
 It is well made if it is well planted 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.770
 how many refills have you had etc. 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.689
 all this with the intention of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.969
 protect us all from a fraud of something 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.539
 what's happening out there and nothing else 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.890
 not good with this I say goodbye I send you a 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.890
 hug and I hope to see you soon 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.040
 and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.970
 but good 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 do not 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.240
 good 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.099
 the distribution of water 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 ah 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 for him 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430
 but 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.750
 of the state 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.750
 do not buy 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.930
 triggers another of the interactions 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.400
 most important of nature the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.400
 entrance to the water mixture 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.990
 ah 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.410
 well I would take a tad more than 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.630
 a tad 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.620
 and you are already and practically in your 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.620
 point 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.030
 varieties 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.810
 a mouth with a safety issue 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.810
 a word 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.590
 we are night where we are the faculty 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.590
 of architecture 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.250
 you have to design a chemical formulation 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.250
 and over for the selection of plants 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.919
 recording 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.960
 it's going well done with everyone 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.190
 tourists 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.190
 but I like it a lot 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.530
 up here 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.469
 I'm not going to throw away until we know 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:57.589
 until we know well enough I 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.909
 ensures that I can fly myself and then 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.299
 in the next descent and now I take 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.299
 from here 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.689
 equal and average 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.040
 what happens is that the wet wall is 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.040
 humidity 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.040
 He says 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.689
 and there are some tasks 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.639
 yum 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:31.330
 there are even begonias today there is a theory 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.330
 very pretty 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.309
 but how good you are 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:47.719
 when I miss my water boots 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.719
 of being looking not arrived yet 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:14.750
 amount of brines a plant that is 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:17.930
 moving the jungles and has a leaf if 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.410
 the winged and pull the flower is to praise 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.830
 pop out the strip of the sheet this is a 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.830
 polyp 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:35.120
 but if you are in digits of 22 plants 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.120
 is suffering here 

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:44.250
 and a little animal of the Lord 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.350
 he's my son from the fuck
