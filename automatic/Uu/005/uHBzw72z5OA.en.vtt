00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.760
 you were once in a very, very distant country 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.629
 a computer engineer who wanted 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.629
 put your doctorate 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.060
 his specialty was the simulation of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.010
 hair is to write algorithms that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.250
 make digital hair look like 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 real one day his thesis supervisor told him 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.970
 the disney animation company 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.140
 I was preparing a movie based on 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.600
 a saint and clear that was a happy 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.380
 chance because it 's hard to find 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.400
 with a hairier subject than this girl and 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.280
 head that measures 70 feet is to say more than 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.220
 20 meters and it should be seen in almost every 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.900
 movie scene so our 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.180
 generates became the engineer of 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.640
 Disney and there his job would be to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.040
 do with artists and animators that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.380
 rapunzel's hair looked real in the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.049
 movie I have if this does not seem like a 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.060
 challenge think twice note 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 that in a human head there are more than 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 100,000 individual hairs imagine 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 have to mobilize more than 100,000 and the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.409
 that interact with each other 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.909
 objects constantly the strategy that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.720
 they followed the movie was the one of 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.230
 approximate the number of hairs until 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 173 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.680
 in this previous animation you can see the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 individual hairs and compare them with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.820
 the final result to the right the trick 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.980
 It works because the hair that is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.950
 very close to each other tend to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.200
 behave in a very similar way 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.550
 But as is the way this is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.190
 one of the pitfalls to save because 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.260
 on individual hair fibers 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 there are lots of scientific studies 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.690
 but about the hair set nothing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.370
 so that our engineer and her 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.710
 team of animators had to 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.660
 get down to work and observe and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.550
 study how the hair behaved 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 in different situations for later 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.780
 model that behavior in software 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 in this animation we can see in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.620
 different colors the hair that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.650
 have each programmed with parameters 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.600
 different 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.060
 the hair is treated as if it were 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.620
 docks are literally used the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 physical models that describe the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 movement of the springs although not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.680
 they use all the real models to 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.390
 100% because that would generate problems well 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.340
 strangers like for example that the weight 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.610
 of rapÃºn's hair is to model 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.890
 it would faithfully weigh between 30 and 40 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 kilograms it is impossible for the young 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 protagonist will charge all day with that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.700
 weight or worse imagine that it is loose 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.860
 and her hair basically transforms 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.480
 in a 70-foot mop that goes 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 dragging where he walks 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.280
 so the animators used some 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.650
 tricks to keep hair out 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.960
 annoying heavy uncomfortable and basically 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.990
 made life and movements impossible 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.170
 from rapunzel the result is not 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.060
 supposedly faithful with the real world but yes 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.060
 with the world of the movie I have
