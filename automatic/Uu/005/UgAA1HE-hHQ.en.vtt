00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.760

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.510
 A file button appears on the screen. 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.429

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:05.229
 additional parameter just one this 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.630
 I do not need a tick so I do not put 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.430

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 a little warning that you can 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.119
 write only part of the screen to me 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.009

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:39.729
 in mathematics I will close it and see how 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:41.829
 everything is recorded as you see as you 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.719

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.850
 red button to save 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.130
 A small export window appears as 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.469
 this name is so if needed and somewhere 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.039
 Spring where to save me save not 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.409
 it is necessary therefore and click not to save that 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.270
 regards the recording of games that sword to them 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.460
 able to write at the same time your voice and 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.109
 hearing games in almost all games 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 at least with this I was straining 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.259
 only in the game call of duty black ops 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.560
 and you can make sure of it 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.989
 alone watching the video on my 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 she will sum up a little 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.500
 The advantages of this method are: 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.450
 no need to download third party 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.220
 time-consuming procedure 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 to use as such 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.560
 2 is the easiest comfortable way. 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 records that met 3 but it's just 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.989
 apple 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 fourth output video is obtained 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.790
 very high quality and small than what 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 Itâ€™s also important that 5 processing of the recorded 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 video takes a few seconds hope 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 that I helped everyone if something remained 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.040
 incomprehensible write in the comments and in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.340
 group vkontakte all have a nice day 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.340
