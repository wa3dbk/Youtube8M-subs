speed of 300 tool to offset tool and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.680 
speed of 300 tool to offset tool and
then<00:04:27.130> we<00:04:27.220> have<00:04:27.400> an<00:04:27.520> amount<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:28.030> finishing<00:04:28.419> stop

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
then we have an amount of finishing stop

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.020 
then we have an amount of finishing stop
to<00:04:28.930> be<00:04:29.050> left<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.620> finishing<00:04:30.040> pass<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.640> in

to be left for the finishing pass and in

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.909 
to be left for the finishing pass and in
this<00:04:31.150> example<00:04:31.570> we<00:04:31.960> will<00:04:32.110> use<00:04:32.610> 5<00:04:33.610> thousandths

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
this example we will use 5 thousandths

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.820 
this example we will use 5 thousandths
you<00:04:35.919> can<00:04:36.070> select<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.520> machine<00:04:36.880> Z<00:04:37.600> or<00:04:37.840> X<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.440> we

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
you can select a machine Z or X and we

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.659 
you can select a machine Z or X and we
will<00:04:38.950> do<00:04:39.130> Z

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.350 

simulate<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.659> program

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:59.970 

and<00:04:51.789> save<00:04:52.789> your<00:04:52.819> cycle<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.750> your<00:04:53.930> part<00:04:54.199> program
