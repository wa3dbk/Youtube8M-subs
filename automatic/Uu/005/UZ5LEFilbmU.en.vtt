00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
to the right until you can see both

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.840 
to the right until you can see both
those<00:00:38.300> lines<00:00:38.600> joined<00:00:38.989> up<00:00:42.250> it's<00:00:43.250> better<00:00:43.489> but<00:00:43.760> I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
those lines joined up it's better but I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.820 
those lines joined up it's better but I
still<00:00:44.180> struggle<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.019> you'd<00:00:45.170> still<00:00:45.410> know<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.650> go

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
still struggle so you'd still know to go

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.860 
still struggle so you'd still know to go
further<00:00:46.070> now<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.730> just<00:00:47.059> lean<00:00:47.360> over<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.809> little

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
further now just just lean over a little

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.110 
further now just just lean over a little
bit<00:00:48.079> further<00:00:48.320> now<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:49.100> what<00:00:49.309> we<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.670> see<00:00:49.700> is

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
bit further now now what we can see is

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.240 
bit further now now what we can see is
there<00:00:50.329> ain't<00:00:50.480> now<00:00:50.690> okay<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.410> what<00:00:51.770> we<00:00:51.890> can<00:00:52.010> see

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
there ain't now okay so what we can see

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.549 
there ain't now okay so what we can see
is<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.520> level<00:00:52.879> of<00:00:52.969> Correction<00:00:53.660> that<00:00:54.110> Simon

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
is the level of Correction that Simon

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.830 
is the level of Correction that Simon
has<00:00:54.649> had<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.920> go<00:00:54.950> through<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.700> site<00:00:56.000> perfectly

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
has had to go through to site perfectly

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.720 
has had to go through to site perfectly
at<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.230> centerline<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.190> dartboard

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
at the centerline of the dartboard

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.520 
at the centerline of the dartboard
now<00:00:59.329> clearly<00:00:59.690> we<00:00:59.840> wouldn't<00:01:00.079> have<00:01:00.170> Simon

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
now clearly we wouldn't have Simon

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.869 
now clearly we wouldn't have Simon
playing<00:01:00.739> like<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.129> but<00:01:01.520> we'll<00:01:01.670> deal<00:01:01.850> with

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
playing like that but we'll deal with

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.999 
playing like that but we'll deal with
that<00:01:02.059> as<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:02.420> move<00:01:02.600> through<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:02.989> session<00:01:03.260> so

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
that as we move through this session so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.710 
that as we move through this session so
here<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:04.430> have<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> view<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.910> Simon<00:01:05.509> in<00:01:05.660> his

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.520 
center
okay<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.570> now<00:01:59.720> we<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.990> Simon<00:02:00.410> in<00:02:00.500> his

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
okay so now we have Simon in his

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.860 
okay so now we have Simon in his
corrected<00:02:01.130> position<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.850> yaki<00:02:02.150> sighting

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
corrected position at the yaki sighting

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.360 
corrected position at the yaki sighting
perfectly<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> centerline<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.190> the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
perfectly to the centerline of the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.900 
perfectly to the centerline of the
dartboard

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
dartboard

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.940 
dartboard
the<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.750> thing<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.080> we<00:02:06.170> will<00:02:06.290> start<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.740> see

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the one thing that we will start to see

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.160 
the one thing that we will start to see
is<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.700> darts<00:02:08.119> will<00:02:08.330> start<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:08.960> in

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
is that the darts will start to go in

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:23.560 
is that the darts will start to go in
much<00:02:09.710> straighter<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:11.270> centerline

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
i steam after throw incited how would

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.720 
i steam after throw incited how would
you<00:02:26.810> make<00:02:26.930> my<00:02:27.170> daughter<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:28.040> couple<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.610> things

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you make my daughter a couple of things

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.400 
you make my daughter a couple of things
that<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:28.970> happened<00:02:29.090> really<00:02:29.420> point<00:02:30.020> one<00:02:30.230> is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
that have happened really point one is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.690 
that have happened really point one is
that<00:02:30.620> when<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.800> guards<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.280> gone<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that when the guards have gone into the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.510 
that when the guards have gone into the
illustrator<00:02:32.270> yet<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.470> actual<00:02:33.770> fact<00:02:33.800> more

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
to the center line okay and two if we

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.980 
to the center line okay and two if we
turn<00:02:38.090> around<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.360> look<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:38.660> them<00:02:38.810> by

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
turn around and look at them by

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.060 
turn around and look at them by
comparison<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.130> previous<00:02:40.400> position

comparison to your previous position

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.110 
comparison to your previous position
where<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.250> darts<00:02:43.580> would<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.820> gone<00:02:43.970> in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
where your darts would have gone in

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.350 
where your darts would have gone in
across<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.720> dartboard<00:02:45.050> like<00:02:45.710> that<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:47.120> we

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
across the dartboard like that if we

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
across the dartboard like that if we
don't<00:02:47.570> take<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.260> doubles<00:02:48.800> I've

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
don't take that to the doubles I've

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.940 
don't take that to the doubles I've
become<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.330> plant<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.780> position<00:02:51.350> your

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
become your plant is position your

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.860 
become your plant is position your
double<00:02:52.280> Ted<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.820> standing<00:02:53.270> off<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.660> left

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
double Ted is standing off to the left

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.020 
double Ted is standing off to the left
of<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.140> Aki<00:02:54.530> would<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.160> been<00:02:55.370> further

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
of the Aki would have been further

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.780 
of the Aki would have been further
thrown<00:02:56.540> even<00:02:56.990> more<00:02:57.230> weight<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.310> double

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
thrown even more weight in your double

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.120 
thrown even more weight in your double
sixteen<00:02:59.240> so<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> have<00:03:00.080> been<00:03:00.200> throwing<00:03:00.530> closer

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
sixteen so I have been throwing closer

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.190 
sixteen so I have been throwing closer
here<00:03:01.610> closer<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.480> way<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.810> other<00:03:03.050> two

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
here closer here the way the other two

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.110 
here closer here the way the other two
attained<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.680> an<00:03:04.310> angle<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.730> flopped<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
attained and an angle that flopped the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.449 
attained and an angle that flopped the
bed<00:03:05.420> possible<00:03:05.990> yeah<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.350> possibly<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.250> see

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
bed possible yeah and possibly you see

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.280 
bed possible yeah and possibly you see
your<00:03:07.670> double<00:03:07.820> ten<00:03:08.209> would<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:08.900> gone<00:03:09.080> in<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
your double ten would have gone in a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.470 
your double ten would have gone in a
battle<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.400> how'd<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.610> got<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.060> missed<00:03:11.270> a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
battle so how'd it got it missed a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930 
battle so how'd it got it missed a
double<00:03:11.780> ten<00:03:12.050> over<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.860> fact<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.160> repositional

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
double ten over the fact of repositional

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.670 
double ten over the fact of repositional
and<00:03:14.360> that's<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.630> bit<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.840> an<00:03:14.930> exaggeration<00:03:15.170> but

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
and that's a bit of an exaggeration but

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.130 
and that's a bit of an exaggeration but
for<00:03:15.980> example<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.490> you're<00:03:16.700> here<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.930> you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
for example if you're here then you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.020 
for example if you're here then you
virtually<00:03:18.380> lock<00:03:18.800> up<00:03:18.980> your<00:03:19.010> double<00:03:19.400> tank<00:03:19.610> so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
virtually lock up your double tank so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.430 
virtually lock up your double tank so
when<00:03:20.390> I'm<00:03:20.510> throw<00:03:20.720> over<00:03:20.900> doubles

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
when I'm throw over doubles

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.590 
when I'm throw over doubles
I<00:03:21.530> don't<00:03:21.890> move<00:03:22.100> from<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.459> new<00:03:22.670> sighted<00:03:23.150> position

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
I don't move from a new sighted position

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.170 
I don't move from a new sighted position
no<00:03:23.990> so<00:03:24.650> how<00:03:24.890> does<00:03:24.950> my<00:03:25.220> body<00:03:25.370> react<00:03:25.850> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
no so how does my body react to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.240 
no so how does my body react to
difference<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.410> board<00:03:27.650> how<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.130> how<00:03:28.220> is

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
difference in the board how is it how is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.640 
difference in the board how is it how is
that<00:03:28.519> gonna<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:29.959> understand<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.500> and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
that gonna so I can understand that and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.110 
that gonna so I can understand that and
that's<00:03:30.830> that's<00:03:31.130> quite<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> big<00:03:31.580> objection<00:03:32.000> by

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
that's that's quite a big objection by

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.360 
that's that's quite a big objection by
some<00:03:32.330> people<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.080> let's<00:03:33.260> let's<00:03:33.560> recap<00:03:34.010> first

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
some people so let's let's recap first

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.020 
some people so let's let's recap first
we<00:03:34.760> actually<00:03:35.330> even<00:03:35.989> up<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:37.100> bias<00:03:37.400> we<00:03:37.850> make

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
we actually even up the bias we make

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.759 
we actually even up the bias we make
sure<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.420> there's<00:03:38.660> perfect<00:03:38.870> way<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.260> throws

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
sure that there's perfect way to throws

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.380 
sure that there's perfect way to throws
to<00:03:39.980> both<00:03:40.130> sides<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.700> darkness<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.269> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
to both sides of the darkness so the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.479 
to both sides of the darkness so the
same<00:03:41.570> distance<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:42.590> easier<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.250> then

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
same distance and it's easier and then

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.130 
same distance and it's easier and then
secondly<00:03:43.910> when<00:03:44.090> we're<00:03:44.239> actually<00:03:44.390> going<00:03:44.780> for<00:03:45.080> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
secondly when we're actually going for a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.990 
secondly when we're actually going for a
double<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.650> bit<00:03:45.800> like<00:03:45.950> again<00:03:46.370> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
double it's a bit like again the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
double it's a bit like again the
marksman<00:03:47.480> with<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.690> gun<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.680> don't<00:03:48.709> actually

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
marksman with the gun we don't actually

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.729 
marksman with the gun we don't actually
