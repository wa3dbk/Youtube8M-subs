the config manager infrastructure but I
want<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.350> use<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.680> deploy<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.489> application

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
want to use to deploy the application

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.349 
want to use to deploy the application
also<00:03:59.720> next<00:04:00.140> again<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.680> then<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> get<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.910> choose

also next again and then I get to choose

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.059 
also next again and then I get to choose
how<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:02.690> want<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.049> application<00:04:03.170> installed<00:04:03.859> in

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
how I want the application installed in

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.470 
how I want the application installed in
this<00:04:04.609> case<00:04:04.850> I'm<00:04:05.030> going<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.209> set<00:04:05.359> the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
this case I'm going to set the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.720 
this case I'm going to set the
application<00:04:05.600> as<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.079> required<00:04:06.680> install<00:04:07.310> that

application as a required install that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.729 
application as a required install that
will<00:04:07.880> basically<00:04:08.060> mean<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.750> pop-up<00:04:09.290> toasts

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
will basically mean that pop-up toasts

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.220 
will basically mean that pop-up toasts
will<00:04:09.890> nag<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.430> user<00:04:10.640> into<00:04:11.390> installing<00:04:12.109> the

will nag the user into installing the

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.140 
will nag the user into installing the
application<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.040> I'll<00:04:13.370> also<00:04:13.579> get<00:04:14.000> an

not my inducers have installed this
particular<00:04:19.220> application<00:04:22.600> next<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.720> say<00:04:23.840> when<00:04:24.229> I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
particular application next I say when I

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.560 
particular application next I say when I
want<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.740> make<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.400> app<00:04:25.520> available<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.389> my

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
want to make the app available to my

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.060 
want to make the app available to my

say what the user experience will be

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.710 
say what the user experience will be
like<00:04:32.090> inside<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.990> so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
like inside of so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.350 
like inside of so
we're<00:04:33.900> sensor<00:04:34.290> for<00:04:34.650> our<00:04:34.830> end<00:04:34.980> user<00:04:35.210> we<00:04:36.210> then

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
we're sensor for our end user we then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.120 
we're sensor for our end user we then
get<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.750> decide<00:04:36.960> any<00:04:37.230> information<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.800> comes
