00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
drawing so that's the hair's getting

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
drawing so that's the hair's getting
darkened<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.159> using<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> sketch<00:01:56.969> pen<00:01:57.530> okay<00:01:58.729> he

has more hair on the top of it which is
being<00:02:01.710> rounded<00:02:02.100> off<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.820> all<00:02:03.090> there

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
