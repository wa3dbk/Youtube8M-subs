and then put them in the mattress pocket

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.449 
and then put them in the mattress pocket
together<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.810> intersection<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> file

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
together this intersection is a file

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.300 
together this intersection is a file
folder<00:02:34.730> paste<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.420> down<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.280> just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
folder paste it down and so it just
