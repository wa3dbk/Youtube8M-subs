Namaskar	
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:15.062
We often make lemon and mango pickle but today we’ll make Sem Pickle.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.320
Sem is usually used to make sabzi, but pickle made out of it taste even more delicious and tempting.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.055
Let’s start with the procedure of making Sem pickle.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:31.992
For this we have taken 500 grams (½ kg) sem.

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:43.101
Try selecting the best quality sem without any marks.

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:50.828
So, we have selected good quality sem, washed it thoroughly and dried.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.625
First, cut the sem.

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:55.366
So, let’s start with cutting the sem.

00:00:55.664 --> 00:01:11.765
Remove the threads from sem like this from both ends.

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:17.882
First, remove threads from all the sem likewise.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.109
After this, cut them in 1 to 0.75 inch chunks.

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:37.826
If the sem in unripe, then the thread is not very long.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:44.115
And if the sem is soft and you get no thread to pull out, then use it as it is.

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:55.006
Clean them like this and cut into pieces.

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.225
Likewise cut all sem.

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:09.357
We need boiling water to blanch the sem, so place some water over flame for this.

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:22.178
So, take any vessel and add 3 to 4 cups of water so that sem is drenched into it nicely.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:30.662
We have taken water in a vessel, cover and turn on the flame so that water starts boiling quickly.

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:33.287
And meanwhile continue with chopping the sem.

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:41.217
We are done with chopping the sem and water has also started boiling.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.888
Place sem in boiling water, cover and keep then as it for 3 minutes.

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:52.483
After 3minutes, drain the water.

00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:57.225
It’s been 3 minutes; now take out sem from water.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:01.342
We just need to blanch the sem. 
Don’t cook it.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.497
Place it boiling water, cover and keep it as it for 3 minutes on high flame.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.006
Now turn off the flame.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.935
Take out the sem and place it over a sieve so that extra water drains out.

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:23.678
We are done with blanching the sem and is greener in color.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:31.099
Now place them over a cloth, spread above a tray.

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:34.889
Spread the sem over a cloth.

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:52.037
You can place the sem under sunlight for 2 to 2.5 hours or under fan for same duration to dry them.

00:03:52.358 --> 00:03:58.295
After this start with making pickle.

00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.647
So, we are placing the sem under sunlight.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:11.435
We kept the sem under sunlight for 2 hours and are dry completely.

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:18.365
Sem appear fresh and green, but make sure there is no water in them.

00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:20.115
You can even dry them under fan.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:23.162
We are done and sem is now dry.

00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:31.701
Now let’s start with making pickle.

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:42.162
Take sem in bowl and mix pickle spices into it.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:05:01.632
We have taken 2 tbsp yellow mustard powder (coarsely grounded), 2 tbsp fenugreek powder (coarsely grounded), 2 tbsp fennel powder

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:19.562
(coarsely grounded), 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp red chilly powder, ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper powder.

00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:30.819
You can even crush the peppercorn coarsely using Ihe mortar pestle.

00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:37.701
Also we have taken 2 pinch asafoetida powder and ¼ cup mustard oil.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.241
We have taken oil with room temperature to give it a pungent flavor.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:54.741
If you don’t like the pungent flavor of the mustard oil, then heat for while and then add in pickle.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:59.421
I am adding the oil without heating it up to enhance the flavor of pickle.

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:10.483
Also, we have taken 2tbsp vinegar, add it as well.

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:19.443
Mix all the ingredients really well.

00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:23.131
We have nicely mixed the spices and sem is coated well with the spices.

00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:38.608
Now cover it and within 3 days this pickle can be consumed when all the spices will be absorbed in the sem.

00:06:38.952 --> 00:06:55.506
Stir the pickle daily with help of a spoon so that the juice and spices settled at the bottom of bowl mixes well.

00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:58.882
Store the pickle in a container.

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:11.217
Make sure you wash the container with boiling water first and then dry it under sunlight.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:18.225
Any kind of dirt and moisture should not be present in the container.

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:25.100
Use a clean and dry spoon for taking out the pickle.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:35.436
Pickles have longer shelf life and this sem pickle can be consumed for upto a month or so.
