or it's just it was too vague and too
bullshit<00:06:05.970> that's<00:06:06.419> the<00:06:06.539> only<00:06:06.660> time<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:06.870> get<00:06:07.110> mad

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
bullshit that's the only time I get mad

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.740 
bullshit that's the only time I get mad
but<00:06:07.830> this<00:06:08.160> I'm<00:06:08.699> satisfied<00:06:09.120> I'm<00:06:09.479> not<00:06:09.599> gonna

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
but this I'm satisfied I'm not gonna

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.240 
but this I'm satisfied I'm not gonna
hold<00:06:09.870> my<00:06:09.960> breath<00:06:10.110> decision<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:10.979> where

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
hold my breath decision to but where

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.279 
hold my breath decision to but where
it's<00:06:11.400> at<00:06:11.580> now<00:06:11.820> I<00:06:11.849> think<00:06:12.120> season<00:06:12.660> 2<00:06:12.810> could<00:06:13.080> even

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
it's at now I think season 2 could even

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.010 
it's at now I think season 2 could even
surpass<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:14.460> first<00:06:14.729> season<00:06:15.090> ultimately<00:06:15.810> if<00:06:15.930> I

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
surpass the first season ultimately if I

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.050 
surpass the first season ultimately if I
had<00:06:16.199> to<00:06:16.320> give<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.680> a<00:06:16.740> score<00:06:17.219> it<00:06:17.430> was<00:06:17.580> just<00:06:17.940> you

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
had to give this a score it was just you

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.089 
had to give this a score it was just you
know<00:06:18.090> it<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.510> really<00:06:19.229> well<00:06:19.440> done<00:06:19.469> it<00:06:20.039> was

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
know it was really well done it was

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.250 
know it was really well done it was
quality<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:21.180> wasn't<00:06:21.719> anything<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.080> mean

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
quality it wasn't anything I mean

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.980
