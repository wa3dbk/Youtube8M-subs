00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
in speed and 60 in luck so pretty much

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
the same as the series and one I believe

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.570 
the same as the series and one I believe
may<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> little<00:02:56.680> bit<00:02:56.860> increasing<00:02:57.280> somebody

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
may be a little bit increasing somebody

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.780 
may be a little bit increasing somebody
to<00:02:57.670> via<00:02:58.410> aspects<00:02:59.410> but<00:03:01.530> basically<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.860> pretty

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
to via aspects but basically the pretty

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.990 
to via aspects but basically the pretty
much<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.090> only<00:03:04.860> aesthetically<00:03:06.000> different

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
much the only aesthetically different

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.140 
much the only aesthetically different
change<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.200> two<00:03:08.620> tenderizer<00:03:09.459> upgrades<00:03:10.000> on

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
change is the two tenderizer upgrades on

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.020 
change is the two tenderizer upgrades on
his<00:03:10.300> hands<00:03:10.769> then<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:12.100> his<00:03:12.280> mouth<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.730> closed

on<00:03:13.060> their<00:03:13.450> first<00:03:13.720> original<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.440> mouths

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
on their first original and the mouths

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
on their first original and the mouths
open<00:03:14.920> like<00:03:15.790> he's<00:03:15.910> about<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.330> better<00:03:16.450> cry

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750

wedding with the the one fist in the
first<00:03:21.340> series<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.730> then<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.000> he's<00:03:22.180> about<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480

one and that's pretty much the only real

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.819 
one and that's pretty much the only real
difference<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:27.940> character<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:29.620> still

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
difference of this character it's still

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
an overall not bad character as long as

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.930 
an overall not bad character as long as
you<00:03:31.630> do<00:03:31.780> some<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.260> challenges<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.489> boost

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
to use he is one more unless you use the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.190 
to use he is one more unless you use the
secondary<00:04:07.970> attack<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.360> actually<00:04:08.720> pretty<00:04:08.900> fast

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
secondary attack is actually pretty fast

secondary attack is actually pretty fast
so<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.770> would<00:04:10.490> take<00:04:10.640> him<00:04:10.760> over<00:04:11.200> probably<00:04:12.200> prison

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
so I would take him over probably prison

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.960 
so I would take him over probably prison
break<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.800> stuff<00:04:13.010> like<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.220> but<00:04:13.400> here<00:04:13.850> is<00:04:13.940> a

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
break and stuff like that but here is a

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.140 
break and stuff like that but here is a
series<00:04:14.390> one<00:04:14.540> model<00:04:15.020> she<00:04:15.860> can<00:04:16.040> see<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.489> think<00:04:17.090> he

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
series one model she can see I think he

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.310 
series one model she can see I think he
was<00:04:17.239> also<00:04:17.359> one<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.660> first<00:04:17.840> characters<00:04:18.230> you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
was also one of the first characters you

that gold paint because also missing a

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.799 
that gold paint because also missing a
lot<00:06:30.259> of<00:06:30.379> the<00:06:30.469> spikes<00:06:30.770> I<00:06:31.449> just<00:06:32.449> kind<00:06:32.659> of<00:06:32.689> weird

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:32.809 
lot of the spikes I just kind of weird

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.239 
lot of the spikes I just kind of weird
the<00:06:32.990> ones<00:06:33.169> on<00:06:33.349> is<00:06:33.469> serious<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:33.949> you<00:06:33.979> had<00:06:34.159> or

the ones on is serious to you had or
actually<00:06:34.490> flatten<00:06:34.699> but<00:06:34.939> they<00:06:35.029> still<00:06:35.180> don't

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
actually flatten but they still don't

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.839 
actually flatten but they still don't
look<00:06:35.479> as<00:06:35.629> big<00:06:35.839> as<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.139> one<00:06:36.169> on<00:06:36.409> the<00:06:36.650> series<00:06:37.610> one

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
look as big as the one on the series one

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.450 
look as big as the one on the series one
which<00:06:38.210> I<00:06:38.300> thought<00:06:38.449> was<00:06:38.569> kind<00:06:38.719> of<00:06:38.809> odd<00:06:39.460> same

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
which I thought was kind of odd same

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.420 
which I thought was kind of odd same
thing<00:06:40.669> with<00:06:40.759> the<00:06:40.879> spikes<00:06:41.180> on<00:06:41.389> his<00:06:41.419> own<00:06:42.159> on<00:06:43.159> the

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569 
he only has two here same thing he's got

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.019 
he only has two here same thing he's got
three<00:06:59.689> on<00:06:59.779> the<00:06:59.870> back<00:07:00.080> legs<00:07:00.439> I'm<00:07:01.399> series<00:07:01.819> one

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.029 
three on the back legs I'm series one

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.379 
three on the back legs I'm series one
and<00:07:02.210> he's<00:07:02.300> only<00:07:02.509> got<00:07:02.689> one<00:07:02.740> on<00:07:03.740> the<00:07:03.800> series<00:07:04.159> 2

and he's only got one on the series 2
which<00:07:05.389> is<00:07:05.419> odd<00:07:05.719> but

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
which is odd but

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.330 
which is odd but
now<00:07:08.020> that<00:07:08.229> maybe<00:07:08.350> it's<00:07:08.560> just<00:07:08.620> part<00:07:09.190> of<00:07:09.280> the

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
now that maybe it's just part of the

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.150 
now that maybe it's just part of the
upgrade<00:07:09.759> not<00:07:09.940> sure<00:07:10.150> he<00:07:10.240> does<00:07:10.419> have<00:07:10.600> some<00:07:11.160> not

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
really sure if that's I'm pretty sure

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.330 
really sure if that's I'm pretty sure
that<00:07:13.780> might<00:07:13.930> be<00:07:14.050> just<00:07:14.080> be<00:07:14.440> battle<00:07:14.800> damage<00:07:15.190> or

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
that might be just be battle damage or

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.830 
that might be just be battle damage or
it's<00:07:15.430> supposed<00:07:15.699> to<00:07:15.789> be<00:07:16.000> I<00:07:16.240> think<00:07:16.750> it's
