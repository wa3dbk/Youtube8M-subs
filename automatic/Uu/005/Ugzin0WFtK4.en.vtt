00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.290
 on 11.06 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 yes, there was a small incident 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.319
 an aroma manufacturer in i believe was 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.830
 I believe it is a new one 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.190
 Cologne 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.019
 and this incident solved that 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.280
 the following out of joy that a substance 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.940
 called tholen was released so 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.620
 if not bad but this substance 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 He's a bit of a club 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 how was that still a few flowers 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.890
 distillation process is somehow too 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.640
 in contact with a hot surface 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.840
 come there was such an evaporation 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.790
 extinguishing system was activated and all 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.620
 whole doses and then against the whole 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.380
 through the chimney, of course, too 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.799
 time out in heaven so formed 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.410
 a huge cloud such a stock without 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.470
 shit and the whole thing that roll 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.290
 whole cloud the rock night magic 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.510
 Do you believe that or what you can do it 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.579
 you I read night could not 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.350
 imagine that makes you before her 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.750
 in the morning or get up in the morning and that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.150
 whole bude after any spices 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.420
 the magic is similar, yes, there you go 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.090
 still 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.640
 and then that is not gone after one 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.220
 hour that keeps pulling into the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.230
 clothe the citation everywhere 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.140
 is the whole bude first a week 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.609
 after maggi really cool really right 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.430
 cool and of course a bit 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.500
 even deeper, a little deeper 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.250
 to enter the matter 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.090
 yes very briefly mentioned this again 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.730
 to do stuff is an odor component 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.350
 the plant lovage lovage 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.630
 probably all could be from the name 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.760
 I've heard of it now is no 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.350
 drink or something is just a plant 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.930
 and this plant is very similar to 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.350
 maggi seasoned 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.800
 magic smell magic herb and yes that 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.810
 whole then went into the atmosphere 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.970
 played such a giant cloud should 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.440
 and yesterday yesterday the front of the 11 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.810
 was the one in Cologne 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.720
 all cologne except edge and tied whole 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.880
 City smelt of spice 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.300
 After that, magic and the whole moped 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.759
 the whole cloud is owed to the wind 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.460
 Wind direction then moved to now 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.380
 Dusseldorf I just say a cold 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.970
 warrior but be glad that he is not too 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.509
 home is and he was the whole in 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.240
 the bude 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.860
 Although I think I like to think so 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 even with the warrior in the bude vetter 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.460
 Of course, like quite happy as well as the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.940
 from you the author does not always determine 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.160
 purely 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.930
 Gerd definitely is the Beginning 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.020
 really crazy friends that was really 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.370
 crazy on twitter and facebook and 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.680
 I do not know, there are so many 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.300
 pictures and yes I just thought that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.620
 i must have talked to friends 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.889
 because that's the absolute bang 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.570
 or and magic has extra again 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.490
 confirmed but now comes friends falls 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.349
 her guardian, first rum wrong 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.750
 made so save as often 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.070
 God come I have previously told friends 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.510
 gameplay is fanatic i got you 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.639
 warned who is still there now 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.229
 good but I would not be stupid 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.740
 comments definitely read magic 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.139
 has denied immediately there was no pr gag 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.139
 and something but friends you never know 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.240
 You never know what's in the bush 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.270
 In any case, I think he hardly go 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.289
 What that 's all it really wanted 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 the theme was joy 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.080
 not bad or son man the cloud 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.979
 really cool puts you like that 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.370
 he said one more brand is waiting 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.220
 4 success the whole house smells 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.460
 maggi such a shit does not work 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.210
 or 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.610
 So I could not imagine 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.370
 that this nonsense is no longer except 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.650
 brother chris without joke and that must be 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.080
 so that's also true who knows magic from 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.380
 smell that's really penetrating 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.729
 smell that's really nasty if it is 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.949
 no idea now 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.080
 vanilla tree was out of the car and afterwards 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.289
 all literally nothing against was 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.759
 So marica madness in any case that 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.250
 whole things are now doing somewhere in 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.650
 düsseldorf to all the residents what 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.500
 is this under and yes more often 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.970
 news look happy and with these 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.000
 so to the end 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.740
 joy 140 based on the khl I believe 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.090
 The last kiel is not done 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.550
 not exciting or such a movie 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.650
 always well anyway 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.900
 In any case, who is looking forward from the room 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.210
 cologne düsseldorf please write 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.889
 below purely who has experienced the live 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.120
 that would really burn me 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.550
 there will certainly be some interest 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.889
 be there and to everyone else in the 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.810
 south east north germany 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.400
 that was an info from me in front of you and 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.860
 yes that 's it 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.820
 Let 's end the gameplay gameplay 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.440
