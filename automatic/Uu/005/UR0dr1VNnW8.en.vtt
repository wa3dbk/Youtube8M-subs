00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
time so the plants will come on more
quickly<00:00:50.010> than<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:50.969> done

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
stopping and getting too hot in there

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.410

up<00:02:28.970> you'll<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> back<00:02:30.480> we've<00:02:31.140> got<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
up you'll see at the back we've got a

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.190 
up you'll see at the back we've got a
shelving<00:02:32.730> system<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.630> adjustable

you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.349> see<00:02:34.500> there's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.709> whole<00:02:34.860> series<00:02:35.190> of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
you can see there's a whole series of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.000 
you can see there's a whole series of
holes<00:02:35.849> down<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.959> back<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.470> allow<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
holes down the back to allow you to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.280 
holes down the back to allow you to
change<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.519> height<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> shelving<00:02:39.510> the

bar<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.530> again<00:02:43.830> we're<00:02:44.010> trying<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.250> let<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
bar so again we're trying to let the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.670 
bar so again we're trying to let the
light<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.819> not<00:02:45.569> having<00:02:45.720> any<00:02:45.930> permanent<00:02:46.470> shadow

light in not having any permanent shadow

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.820 
light in not having any permanent shadow
in<00:02:47.250> there<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.480> they're<00:02:48.989> very<00:02:49.140> useful<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
in there but they're very useful in the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.940 
in there but they're very useful in the
early<00:02:50.100> springtime<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.940> allowing<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.950> put
