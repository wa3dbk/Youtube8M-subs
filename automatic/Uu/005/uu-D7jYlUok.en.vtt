knife actually not quite sure the blade
steel<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> Anvik<00:01:44.360> maybe<00:01:45.360> s30v

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
steel I think it's Anvik maybe s30v

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
steel I think it's Anvik maybe s30v
something<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.580> satin

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
something like that it's going to satin

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330 
something like that it's going to satin

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
finished blade they make a lot of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639 
finished blade they make a lot of
different<00:01:50.490> models<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.330> they<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.350> some

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
green and red I got this I tell like the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
green and red I got this I tell like the
feel<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.149> better<00:02:06.209> plus<00:02:06.959> it<00:02:07.110> was<00:02:07.200> cheaper

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
feel of it better plus it was cheaper

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.420 
feel of it better plus it was cheaper
yeah<00:02:08.330> all<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.630> far<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.830> they'll<00:02:11.220> come

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
yeah all so far as I know they'll come

yeah all so far as I know they'll come
and<00:02:11.550> partially<00:02:11.910> serrated<00:02:12.470> about<00:02:13.470> half<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and partially serrated about half the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
and partially serrated about half the
blade<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.160> partially<00:02:14.490> serrated<00:02:14.700> it's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
blade is partially serrated it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.850 
blade is partially serrated it's
actually<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.720> model<00:02:15.990> i<00:02:16.050> really<00:02:16.380> wanted<00:02:16.650> but

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
actually the model i really wanted but

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.490 
actually the model i really wanted but
they<00:02:17.010> didn't<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.180> hell<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.110> good

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
they didn't have one and hell is good

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.670 
they didn't have one and hell is good
enough<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.930> pocket<00:02:21.930> clip<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.319> not

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
enough I like it pocket clip is not

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
enough I like it pocket clip is not
reversible<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
reversible but not really don't have a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
reversible but not really don't have a
problem<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.620> prefer<00:02:25.950> tip<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.370> Keri

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
problem with that I prefer tip down Keri

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.500 
problem with that I prefer tip down Keri
anyway<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.670> personal<00:02:30.270> preference

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
anyway so it's personal preference

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.390 

it's<00:02:46.819> about<00:02:46.910> two<00:02:47.330> inch<00:02:47.510> blade<00:02:47.900> there<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.959> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
it's about two inch blade there but a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.050 
it's about two inch blade there but a
three<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.550> quarter<00:02:52.819> inch<00:02:53.150> handle<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.970> it

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
three and a quarter inch handle here it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
three and a quarter inch handle here it
is<00:02:59.180> my<00:02:59.390> hand<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.750> see<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.140> pretty<00:03:03.650> small

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
is my hand so you see it is pretty small

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.210 
is my hand so you see it is pretty small
knife<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.810> doesn't<00:03:06.200> need<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.500> real<00:03:06.830> big

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
so you see a reverse grip only the blade

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.080 
so you see a reverse grip only the blade
is<00:03:16.820> showing<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:18.530> pretty<00:03:18.680> cool<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.760> is
