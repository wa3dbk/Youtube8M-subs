the hell it's called stoner menu and I

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.500 
the hell it's called stoner menu and I
spilled<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:03.190> cheese<00:03:03.549> on<00:03:03.730> myself<00:03:03.940> there<00:03:04.299> wasn't

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
spilled in cheese on myself there wasn't

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420 
spilled in cheese on myself there wasn't
even<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.720> much<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> did<00:03:06.010> find<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
even that much on there but I did find a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.800 
even that much on there but I did find a
way<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.580> spill<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.880> cheese<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.180> myself<00:03:07.390> but

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
way to spill the cheese on myself but

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.289 
way to spill the cheese on myself but
either<00:03:07.959> way<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.250> spicy<00:03:09.790> nacho

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
either way that is the spicy nacho

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.650 
either way that is the spicy nacho
chicken<00:03:11.220> sandwich<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.580> yeah<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.510> worth

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
chicken sandwich and yeah it's worth

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.330 
chicken sandwich and yeah it's worth
checking<00:03:13.690> out<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.350> think<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> burger<00:03:14.860> variant

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
checking out I think the burger variant

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.460 
checking out I think the burger variant
is<00:03:15.459> much<00:03:15.880> much<00:03:16.390> tastier<00:03:16.959> though<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.350> would

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
is much much tastier though and I would

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
is much much tastier though and I would
go<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.739> one<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.820> it<00:03:19.030> doesn't<00:03:19.330> matter

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
go with that one if if it doesn't matter

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.789 
go with that one if if it doesn't matter
