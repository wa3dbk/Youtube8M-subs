00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.780
 p 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.939
 sweetheart more people start talking 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.360
 get into the curious assumption 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.459
 that other people stand alone 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.470
 This misconception that is encouraged by its environment 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.500
 says the baby alcohol on incredible how nature is going to open camp 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.670
 m the club wants 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.400
 club Brugge that is an absolute record 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 even her own mother does not realize that mommy is nothing but it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.850
 gather smack to drink who seriously takes the latin word for 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.970
 mother breast it is mama 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.320
 therefore we were able to make all kinds of mistakes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.170
 I recently heard someone say that his brother-in-law worked 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 at the Ministry of Justice 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 all madness on a stick 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 few people know what their own voice sounds like 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.280
 You remember deeply very first time when you were yourself 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.030
 hear from my three choirs at home or with friends 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 in this it means that you are 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.580
 I think so 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.600
 let's be honest of course a bit disappointing 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.660
 now they had to know how many people went home disappointed after one 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 voice test for radio or television 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 it all seems so easy like that broadcaster known newsreader 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.440
 sitting in front of the screen talking 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.410
 apart from their outer appearance 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.570
 They literally have point votes out of thousands 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's standardize those statements 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 in the first place there is the articulation 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.680
 clearly pronouncing every customer 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.490
 Another factor is this conversation speed and finally it is clear that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 The touch that you see is something that has the call named sound of the call 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.690
 to vote 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.409
 you have high and low voices 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.649
 shrill and trees 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.480
 boring a pleasant 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.050
 but that is unfortunately a matter of getting rid of a nice tumble 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.430
 don't match you have it or you don't have it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 whether talking about radio or television on, for example, a lecture in the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 hall 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.660
 beginning of all those speakers has it as hard as you 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.920
 your voice for business linking and yet friendly 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.970
 you may still make a mistake though you have such a fixed and above all 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.140
 you must be understandable under the most unfavorable circumstances 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.820
 the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 weird 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.109
 through 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.679
 when I started it was excellent to understand 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.979
 but just at the most important moment a train arrived within hundreds 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.790
 passengers hurried to the exit 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.629
 and now message was practically lost 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.430
 especially on larger stock all stations built on everything thought of is quite of it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.319
 the acoustics 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.149
 so there is nothing you can do about it 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.319
 two large crowds is therefore recommended 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.269
 to repeat 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.819
 it becomes even more difficult with foreign languages 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.900
 stations with many foreign travelers 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.690
 however, there are cassettes with the most common texts but 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.759
 use those cassettes 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.249
 why would you searched 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.439
 Mensink did the express in the newspaper and you helped us get a line up quickly 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.409
 advocates another job in the film in it 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.919
 that is also possible 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.819
 now 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.629
 not the incident 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.639
 It performs significantly better than it is important to replace another 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.809
 planet did not invade 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.309
 dancers that required 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:20.029
 the mayor is in the list from this data on which express according to meijs 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.159
 all costs in between have been compiled with great care 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.790
 there is still a continuous event with a view to being modern 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.049
 his chance right away 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.049
 they are thus technology only in case you pass it on 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.169
 These are of course unexpected situations in which you too 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.229
 however, be extra critical and individuals with care 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.469
 don't let yourself be done by an experienced colleague 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.769
 by the way, if you have an outspoken talent for foreign languages, 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.370
 or discover that with a colleague then we will be very happy to make an appointment 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.629
 for a utrecht vote test 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.459
 our youth no longer actually spots long we will be on cassette soon 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.259
 states 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.689
 I 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.479
 is not yet known in the game 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.889
 you can get 56 guilders informed during the three days 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.219
 hotel month did and is in the gp 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:15.299
 it is one of the things that does not drink from the booklet tournament ns 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.209
 that you can get free at the counter 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.259
 You have of course also heard that there is a special signal for a new one 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.490
 To make a distinction with the familiar thing do that at forty 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.569
 stations just precedes a message 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.449
 You will hear it again 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.319
 I get the couple 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.340
 May us in the early fall 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.620
 I'd better leave singing to others 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.039
 by the way 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.360
 We wouldn't put the movie on 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.750
 maybe no better 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.800
 others can leave 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.789
 at 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.129
 to have 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.919
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.919
 really awful 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.749
 4 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:01.039
 seriously 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.400
 so neighborhood appreciate how top discussed 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.400
 toys humans are not always in the mood for joking 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.750
 but even a charity phrase if we wish you a pleasant weekend 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.240
 can work your way if you have to do something like that five times on a project 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.139
 tapping 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.979
 are you still in business? 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.370
 kindly march correctly 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.960
 And that brings us to the most important point of the whole story 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.229
 you can have your own voice 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.830
 there are experienced station announcers who have never inquired about 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.550
 their own intelligibility we can always provide microphones both 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.789
 cassette recorders 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.600
 and that way you can ask yourself 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.229
 and your colleagues was calm 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.009
 sometimes it is a small matter 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.009
 a bit quieter also speak better off the clothes 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.360
 an arcade 7 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:57.650
 but 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.150
 it can also be means 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
 he ends 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.080
 years earlier 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 reason 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.469
 weird 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.389
 erik 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.930
 in Europe 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.770
 finally if 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.879
 especially the most experienced speakers at stations in hospitals and the like 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.879
 get a strange looking beer in the long run 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.830
 the back of such a government 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.339
 or something 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.759
 38 again at the end of 2011 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.970
 that is clear 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.680
 no, but it doesn't sound a bit restless you don't think 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.159
 rather speak won 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.749
 Remains a bit interested in the people who talk to them because they do 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:48.879
 are often reckless and then you think 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.780
 it is all too often forgotten that the average Dutch person is not even into it 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.159
 times a year with the text 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.159
 of course we want to change that through too much advertising 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:59.900
 the members expect 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.460
 to shorten a lot of new customers 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.360
 didam 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.050
 for completely newcomers 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.879
 tracks 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.619
 instead of platform 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.039
 shorter stops 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.499
 no in motion pulled out exit control and so on 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.580
 in addition 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.440
 nowadays there are far fewer pensions on the platforms for information 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.569
 provide 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:22.680
 And that is precisely why you are so important 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.729
 your voice 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:25.759
