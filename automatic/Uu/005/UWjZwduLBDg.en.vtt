closed-cell<00:00:35.460> foams<00:00:36.229> we've<00:00:37.229> injected<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
closed-cell foams we've injected the

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.149 
closed-cell foams we've injected the

closed<00:00:41.489> cell<00:00:41.760> phone<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.420> both<00:00:42.570> insulation

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
closed cell phone for both insulation

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.189 
closed cell phone for both insulation
and<00:00:43.790> stabilization<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.659> in<00:00:45.809> neots

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
and stabilization and it's in neots

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.020 
and stabilization and it's in neots
we've<00:00:46.500> sprayed<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> underside<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> roofs

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we've sprayed the underside of the roofs

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.780 
we've sprayed the underside of the roofs
for<00:00:48.540> some<00:00:48.690> added<00:00:48.899> extra<00:00:49.710> insulation<00:00:50.220> measures

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
for some added extra insulation measures

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.880 
for some added extra insulation measures
so<00:00:51.330> we've<00:00:51.479> got<00:00:51.600> an<00:00:51.689> extremely<00:00:52.320> versatile

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so we've got an extremely versatile

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.399 
so we've got an extremely versatile
product<00:00:53.369> here<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.729> really<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.689> we<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.229> need

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
product here that really and we do need

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.950 
product here that really and we do need
professionals<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.820> install<00:00:57.299> and<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
professionals actually to install and it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
professionals actually to install and it
not<00:00:58.199> only<00:00:58.229> helps<00:00:58.769> us<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.159> terms<00:00:59.369> of<00:00:59.549> energy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
not only helps us in terms of energy

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.850 
not only helps us in terms of energy
efficiency<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.290> actual<00:01:01.409> carbon

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
efficiency but also the actual carbon

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.219 
efficiency but also the actual carbon
reduction<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.369> well<00:01:02.549> quite<00:01:03.000> correct<00:01:03.180> yes<00:01:03.540> we

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
reduction as well quite correct yes we

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.850 
reduction as well quite correct yes we
have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:05.040> list<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.640> bas<00:01:06.000> s<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.780> BASF<00:01:07.290> approved

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
have a list of bas s at BASF approved

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
have a list of bas s at BASF approved
contractors<00:01:08.640> who<00:01:09.180> were<00:01:09.329> trained<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> install

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
contractors who were trained to install

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
contractors who were trained to install
both<00:01:10.590> products<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.909> injected<00:01:12.509> into<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
both products one is injected into the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
both products one is injected into the
cavities<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> foams<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.759> situ<00:01:15.149> in<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
cavities so it foams in situ in the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.130 
cavities so it foams in situ in the
cavity<00:01:15.869> helps<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.890> stabilize<00:01:17.399> any<00:01:18.140> loose

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
cavity helps to stabilize any loose

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.550 
cavity helps to stabilize any loose
brickwork<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.100> wall<00:01:20.850> ties<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.440> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
brickwork or wall ties but also with it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
brickwork or wall ties but also with it
expanding<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> cavity<00:01:23.670> helps<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> drop<00:01:24.360> proof

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
expanding the cavity helps to drop proof

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.469 
expanding the cavity helps to drop proof
the<00:01:24.810> property<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.070> other<00:01:26.130> system<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.940> sprayed

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the property the other system is sprayed

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
the property the other system is sprayed
in<00:01:27.659> place<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.260> underside<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> roof<00:01:29.010> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
in place on the underside of the roof so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.640 
in place on the underside of the roof so
it's<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.430> much<00:01:29.670> faster<00:01:29.970> reacting<00:01:30.690> system<00:01:31.170> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
it's a much faster reacting system but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's a much faster reacting system but
once<00:01:31.830> again<00:01:32.010> it<00:01:32.430> provides<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.299> good

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
once again it provides very really good

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
once again it provides very really good
insulation<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.320> helps<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> air

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
insulation and helps with the air

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910 
insulation and helps with the air
tightness<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.940> roof<00:01:36.180> both<00:01:37.170> products<00:01:37.799> are

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
tightness of the roof both products are

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370 
tightness of the roof both products are
installed<00:01:38.370> by<00:01:38.490> BASF<00:01:39.060> approved<00:01:39.690> contractors
