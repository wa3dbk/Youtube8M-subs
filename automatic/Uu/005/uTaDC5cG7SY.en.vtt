I<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.159> thing<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I got another little thing for that it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
I got another little thing for that it
will<00:01:21.479> work<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.780> later<00:01:24.920> here's<00:01:25.920> basically<00:01:26.400> what

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
will work on later here's basically what

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.160 
will work on later here's basically what
that<00:01:26.780> backside<00:01:27.780> looks<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.930> put

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that backside looks like so I just put

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.319 
that backside looks like so I just put
some<00:01:31.650> tape<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> could

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
some tape on there and then so I could

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.730 
some tape on there and then so I could
shut<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> door<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.509> sealed<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.500> pretty

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
shut the door so it's sealed up pretty

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
shut the door so it's sealed up pretty
good<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.930> air<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.350> any<00:01:40.560> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
good so not a lot of air if any is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.330 
good so not a lot of air if any is
moving<00:01:41.040> backwards<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> trunk<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.860> started

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
moving backwards the trunk I started

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.499 
moving backwards the trunk I started
working<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> couple<00:01:45.090> hours<00:01:45.329> ago

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
working on this a couple hours ago

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.460 
working on this a couple hours ago
that's<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> trunk<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> be

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that's what the trunk is going to be

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.080 
that's what the trunk is going to be
looking<00:01:49.710> like

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.550 

cut<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> piece<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:54.850> three<00:01:55.850> quarter<00:01:56.149> inch<00:01:56.299> MDF

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
cut a piece of three quarter inch MDF

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.249 
cut a piece of three quarter inch MDF
just<00:01:57.560> made<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.799> little<00:01:58.689> kind<00:01:59.689> of<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.929> trim

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
just made a little kind of like a trim

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.059 
just made a little kind of like a trim
ring<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.710> guess<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:01.899> cut<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.049> spot<00:02:03.380> out<00:02:03.590> amps

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
ring I guess I cut that spot out amps

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.590 
ring I guess I cut that spot out amps
are<00:02:04.159> underneath<00:02:04.490> there<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.299> you'll<00:02:05.420> be<00:02:05.539> able

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
are underneath there so you'll be able

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.949 
are underneath there so you'll be able
to<00:02:05.719> see<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.990> amps<00:02:06.819> use<00:02:07.819> some<00:02:08.060> white<00:02:08.269> fleece

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
to see the amps use some white fleece

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.009 
to see the amps use some white fleece
stretched<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.129> out<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:13.480> laid<00:02:14.480> two

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
stretched it out and then laid two

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.979 
stretched it out and then laid two
layers<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.500> resin<00:02:15.799> now<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.330> mixed<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> handful

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
layers of resin now I mixed in a handful

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.809 
layers of resin now I mixed in a handful
of<00:02:18.049> sawdust<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.099> resin<00:02:19.489> that's<00:02:19.519> why

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
of sawdust in with the resin that's why

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.430 
of sawdust in with the resin that's why
it<00:02:19.879> looks<00:02:20.060> all<00:02:20.209> chunky<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.780> shitty<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:21.290> it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
it looks all chunky and shitty but it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.759 
it looks all chunky and shitty but it
was<00:02:21.530> real<00:02:21.739> thick<00:02:22.040> when<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.280> put<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.769> it's

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
was real thick when I put it on and it's

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.520 
was real thick when I put it on and it's
hardening<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:25.340> pretty<00:02:25.549> nice<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:27.200> that's<00:02:27.380> what

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
hardening up pretty nice so that's what

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.720 
hardening up pretty nice so that's what
i'm<00:02:27.620> working<00:02:27.769> on<00:02:28.040> hopefully<00:02:28.489> i'll<00:02:28.579> be<00:02:28.610> done

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
i'm working on hopefully i'll be done
