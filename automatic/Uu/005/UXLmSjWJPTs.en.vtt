00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
putting the occasion key on we can start

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.700 
putting the occasion key on we can start
the<00:01:52.320> Waker

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the Waker

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.090 
the Waker
ok<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> vehicle<00:01:54.079> is<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> start

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
ok now the vehicle is on the start

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
ok now the vehicle is on the start
position<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.270> starting<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
position and so we are not starting it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
position and so we are not starting it
but<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.560> giving<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> tips<00:01:58.939> how<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
but we will be giving you tips how it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.899 
but we will be giving you tips how it
functions<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.990> let's<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.710> towards<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.700> class

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
functions so let's go towards the class

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
functions so let's go towards the class
so<00:02:03.390> when<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> vehicle<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.619> start<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.070> must

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so when the vehicle is start you must

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999 
so when the vehicle is start you must
have<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.390> livers<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.560> neutral

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
have the livers in neutral

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.219 
have the livers in neutral
so<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> liver<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.660> neutral<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.020> can

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
so if the liver is in neutral you can

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.839 
so if the liver is in neutral you can
see<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> both<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> direction

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
see it can be more to both the direction

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.350 
see it can be more to both the direction
so

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000 
so
let's<00:02:12.510> engage<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.870> Foskey<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> see<00:02:13.470> cannot<00:02:13.830> move

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
let's engage in Foskey I see cannot move

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.620 
let's engage in Foskey I see cannot move
in<00:02:14.160> both<00:02:14.490> directions<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> decided<00:02:15.450> over

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
in both directions so I decided over

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.010 
in both directions so I decided over
here

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
here

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.450 
here
second<00:02:16.560> guy<00:02:16.710> cannot<00:02:17.010> move<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.310> both

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
second guy cannot move in both

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.040 
second guy cannot move in both
directions<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:18.000> means<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.630> liver<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.960> in

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
directions that means the liver is in

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.180 
directions that means the liver is in
neutral<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.740> move<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.980> both<00:02:20.130> directions

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
neutral it can move in both directions

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.490 
neutral it can move in both directions
so<00:02:20.670> when<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:20.940> start<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.270> vehicle<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:22.080> must<00:02:22.320> put

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
so when we start a vehicle we must put

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
so when we start a vehicle we must put
the<00:02:22.530> liver<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:24.110> neutral

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the liver in neutral

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
the liver in neutral
that<00:02:25.590> means<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.460> drive<00:02:26.670> coming<00:02:26.910> from<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that means the drive coming from the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.110 
that means the drive coming from the
engine<00:02:28.100> will<00:02:29.100> not<00:02:29.190> go<00:02:29.460> towards<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> rear

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
engine will not go towards the rear

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.420 
engine will not go towards the rear
wheels<00:02:30.420> okay<00:02:31.170> when<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.040> neutral

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
wheels okay when it is in a neutral

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.790 
wheels okay when it is in a neutral
position<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.810> will<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.140> take<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.410> novel<00:02:34.710> by

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
position so it will just take a novel by

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.350 
position so it will just take a novel by
the<00:02:34.830> gearbox<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:35.940> transferred<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the gearbox but in one we transferred it

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.510 
the gearbox but in one we transferred it
towards<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> rear<00:02:36.840> wheel<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.440> when<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> start

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
towards the rear wheel so when you start

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.550 
towards the rear wheel so when you start
a<00:02:38.610> vehicle<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.360> safest<00:02:39.720> way<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.320> start

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
a vehicle it is the safest way to start

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.340 
a vehicle it is the safest way to start
it<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.040> also<00:02:41.700> check<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.750> put<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
it so also check that you have put the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.540 
it so also check that you have put the
parking<00:02:43.650> brake<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.130> your<00:02:44.250> parking<00:02:44.520> brake

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
parking brake on if your parking brake

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.020 
parking brake on if your parking brake
is<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.600> trust<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.340> release<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
is on just trust this and release the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.060 
is on just trust this and release the
parking<00:02:48.209> brake<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.470> vehicle<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.830> not

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
parking brake so now the vehicle is not

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.490 
parking brake so now the vehicle is not
on<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> parking<00:02:50.610> brake<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.910> easy<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.660> easy<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
on a parking brake so easy it is easy to

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.979 
on a parking brake so easy it is easy to
be<00:02:52.620> right<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.370> now<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.450> ignition<00:02:54.660> key

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
be right so now just on the ignition key

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.690 
be right so now just on the ignition key
and<00:02:55.230> put<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:57.470> gear<00:02:58.470> towards<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.890> first<00:02:59.220> first

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and put the gear towards the first first

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.760 
and put the gear towards the first first
gear<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.150> before<00:03:00.600> doing<00:03:01.020> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
gear so before doing that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.970 
gear so before doing that
okay<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:03.150> clutch<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:04.290> engaged

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
okay now the clutch is engaged

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.550 
okay now the clutch is engaged
that<00:03:05.130> means<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.550> engine<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.600> engaged<00:03:07.110> with

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that means the engine is engaged with

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.830 
that means the engine is engaged with
the<00:03:07.739> gearbox<00:03:07.980> by<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.940> let's<00:03:09.120> solve<00:03:09.360> we<00:03:09.570> need

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the gearbox by that let's solve we need

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.500 
the gearbox by that let's solve we need
to<00:03:10.020> push<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.950> clutch<00:03:11.220> lever<00:03:11.550> down<00:03:11.880> now<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to push the clutch lever down now the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.140 
to push the clutch lever down now the
engine<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.200> disengaged<00:03:13.860> from<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> gearbox

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
engine is disengaged from the gearbox

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.680 
engine is disengaged from the gearbox
this<00:03:15.840> means<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.410> at<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.250> position<00:03:17.690> even

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
this means that at this position even

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.320 
this means that at this position even
though<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.530> first<00:03:19.830> gear<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.060> drive

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
and put the first year so what happens

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.580 
and put the first year so what happens
when<00:03:51.269> we<00:03:51.360> start<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.690> vehicle<00:03:51.989> from<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.320> rest

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
resistance at this point that means if

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.930 
resistance at this point that means if
the<00:03:57.870> engine<00:03:58.200> has<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.650> move<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.250> vehicle<00:03:59.400> it

has to take all the resistance off the
tire<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.640> means<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.180> much<00:04:03.420> torque<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:04.019> that

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
tire that means that much torque on that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
vehicle by the engine so when we start

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.030 
vehicle by the engine so when we start
the<00:04:12.600> vehicle<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.019> we<00:04:13.230> release<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.860> clutch

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
the vehicle and we release the clutch

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.280 
the vehicle and we release the clutch
just<00:04:14.400> very<00:04:14.700> fast<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:15.720> beginners<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.229> is

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
just very fast for beginners it is

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.890 
just very fast for beginners it is
always<00:04:16.650> an<00:04:16.739> issue<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.790> vehicle<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.600> stops

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
always an issue the vehicle just stops

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.700 
always an issue the vehicle just stops
and<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.650> knock<00:04:19.859> knock<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.229> stops<00:04:22.229> it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
and just knock knock up and it stops it

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.140 
and just knock knock up and it stops it
is<00:04:22.979> just<00:04:23.310> because<00:04:23.460> there<00:04:23.760> really<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
is just because there really is the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.190 
is just because there really is the
clutch<00:04:24.360> much<00:04:24.630> faster<00:04:25.050> when<00:04:25.229> we<00:04:25.380> dare

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
clutch much faster when we dare

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.620 
clutch much faster when we dare
plus<00:04:26.830> much<00:04:27.070> watch<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.400> what<00:04:27.550> happens<00:04:27.940> then<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
plus much watch of what happens then the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.160 
plus much watch of what happens then the
whole<00:04:28.840> resistance<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.430> tire<00:04:30.790> or<00:04:31.510> is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
whole resistance of this tire or is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.310 
whole resistance of this tire or is
acting<00:04:32.830> directly<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.700> gearbox<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:34.900> this

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
acting directly on the gearbox and this

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.710 
acting directly on the gearbox and this
gearbox<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:36.160> giving<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.670> resistance<00:04:37.510> to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
gearbox is giving that resistance to

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.450 
gearbox is giving that resistance to
engine<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:38.200> engine<00:04:38.530> will<00:04:38.710> not<00:04:38.890> be<00:04:39.040> having<00:04:39.220> that

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
engine so engine will not be having that

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.540 
engine so engine will not be having that
but<00:04:39.640> rpm<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.720> rotate<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.530> tires<00:04:41.710> by<00:04:42.280> crossing

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
but rpm to rotate the tires by crossing

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.450 
but rpm to rotate the tires by crossing
this<00:04:43.300> resistance<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:44.530> what<00:04:44.860> here<00:04:45.010> we<00:04:45.190> have<00:04:45.370> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
this resistance so what here we have to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.550 
this resistance so what here we have to
do<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.000> when<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:46.750> disengage<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.530> clutch

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
do is that when we disengage the clutch

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.950 
do is that when we disengage the clutch
slowly<00:04:48.280> engage<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> clutch<00:04:49.390> that<00:04:49.660> means<00:04:49.810> very

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
slowly engage the clutch that means very

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.990 
slowly engage the clutch that means very
slowly<00:04:50.350> in<00:04:50.590> case<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.980> clutch<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.610> engine

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
slowly in case the clutch the engine

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.050 
slowly in case the clutch the engine
will<00:04:52.180> be<00:04:52.210> able<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.810> take<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.170> small<00:04:53.770> Lord<00:04:54.160> of

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
will be able to take the small Lord of

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.840 
will be able to take the small Lord of
the<00:04:55.540> tires<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.440> will<00:04:56.710> slightly<00:04:57.040> transmit

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
the tires so it will slightly transmit

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.420 
the tires so it will slightly transmit
its<00:04:58.030> power<00:04:58.540> towards<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.320> gearbox<00:04:59.830> and<00:04:59.980> we'll

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
its power towards the gearbox and we'll

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.150 
its power towards the gearbox and we'll
start<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:01.660> tyre<00:05:01.870> storage<00:05:02.380> slowly<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:03.010> it

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
start the tyre storage slowly as it

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.150 
start the tyre storage slowly as it
rotates<00:05:03.510> slowly<00:05:04.510> we<00:05:04.840> can<00:05:04.870> release<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.650> clutch

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
rotates slowly we can release the clutch

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.270 
rotates slowly we can release the clutch
gradually<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:07.030> means<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.390> engine<00:05:07.690> will<00:05:07.870> not

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
gradually that means the engine will not

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.940 
gradually that means the engine will not
get<00:05:09.280> stopped<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.870> that's<00:05:11.110> why<00:05:11.380> we<00:05:11.860> are

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
get stopped so that's why we are

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.690 
get stopped so that's why we are
normally<00:05:13.080> slowly<00:05:14.080> releasing<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.460> clutch

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
normally slowly releasing the clutch

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.910 
normally slowly releasing the clutch
this<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.480> technical<00:05:16.960> reason<00:05:17.320> behind<00:05:17.590> that

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
this is the technical reason behind that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.110 
this is the technical reason behind that
and<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.970> hope<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.330> understand<00:05:20.670> how<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.700> drive

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
and I hope you understand how to drive

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.440 
and I hope you understand how to drive
it<00:05:22.350> thank<00:05:23.350> you
