as usual with my failing eyes I've added
my<00:00:46.260> floats<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.010> landing<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.579> protection<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
my floats for landing your protection in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.959 
my floats for landing your protection in
the<00:00:48.360> grass<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:49.410> visual<00:00:49.829> aids<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> sky<00:00:50.640> and

things<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.430> easier<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.210> see

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
things up make it easier for me to see

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
things up make it easier for me to see
so<00:00:55.829> let's<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> goes

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so let's take it out and see how it goes

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
so let's take it out and see how it goes
right<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> box<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> stock

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right out of the box with the stock

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.700 
right out of the box with the stock
settings<00:00:59.399> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> non<00:01:00.629> flybarless<00:01:01.289> rotor

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
settings this is a non flybarless rotor

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
settings this is a non flybarless rotor
head<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> lower<00:01:02.520> fly<00:01:02.879> bar<00:01:03.149> which<00:01:03.449> does

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
head with the lower fly bar which does

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.289 
head with the lower fly bar which does
typically<00:01:04.290> better<00:01:04.530> than<00:01:04.890> parallel<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.150> here

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
typically better than parallel so here

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
typically better than parallel so here
we<00:01:06.420> go

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:02:00.920 

well<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.759> feels<00:01:44.969> nice
