00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.810
 to a new video of game with me 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 children's toys you see here on the left 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.150
 play doh pies zaubers adb and right 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 the topic peak birthday knee z me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 I thought so because we had these two 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.730
 toys already have each one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 I'll do the birthday 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
 a little comparison between the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 both 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 I think at first glance 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 already on that the playbook toy 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.980
 here on the left, the color seems to be in the foreground 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.740
 the colors are in white and in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 pastel shades 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 I think it seems somehow fresh 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 right here the per papic birthday set 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.430
 is bÃ¤nkli something mud I think I 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 in orange and the colors 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 red it all works a bit 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 washed out and not even so 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 appealing that is only mine 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.160
 opinion 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.399
 maybe we are completely different 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.860
 the functions have the play off set 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.309
 I would have a total of three functions 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.070
 say 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.039
 you can rule it once with Ronny's 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 down here in the press then up here 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.950
 Can you still make pies you 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.950
 press the press down here 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 then you have a lot of small ones here 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.369
 molds to garnish pies of the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.990
 papic sets also has different 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.340
 These are, however, in such a way 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.210
 held a plastic 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.830
 You can also make the candle yourself 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.479
 to this film here 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.049
 I think the whole thing does not work that way 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.119
 here the plastic is relatively thin 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.439
 In addition , there was this papic set 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.140
 syringe and others share but me 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.149
 I thought I would try this on the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.159
 syringe synonymous to compare a bit 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.200
 The knead of war, however, is 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.539
 somehow not really suitable 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.149
 the kneading by pressing the syringe 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.330
 because the dough in comparison to 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.770
 Clothes plus dough is very very firm 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.959
 And you have to be able to do a lot of power 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.179
 spend it on the front what comes out 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.459
 So with these streamers I have 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.130
 really needed some time and each 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.370
 a lot of effort that the kneading there too 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.480
 is reasonably evenly come 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.320
 very different the talk plus knead the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.440
 super soft can also be super is 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.730
 is injection tour on super good in this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.000
 feel and come forward then too 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.860
 just pattern out so that on 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.270
 definitely an advantage of the players Said 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.770
 and I think that too 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.840
 birthday cake somehow more hefty 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.250
 maybe it's partly because of it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.780
 that is bigger but it is too 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.700
 certainly the colors and the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.430
 Features Papic has not got me all in all 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 so much like it now in comparison 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.990
 said it is only my opinion how did 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.550
 you are each the game 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.360
 fallen and that you found the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.940
 better i hope my little preview too 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.740
 you liked the two games 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.840
 give me a thumbs up 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.180
 leave me a nice comment 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.010
 and of course do not forget the channel 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 to subscribe like that then to the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.480
