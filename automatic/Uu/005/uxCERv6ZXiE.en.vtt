00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.589
 hello today on our channel 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.389
 repair and usb flash drives 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 but she did with such a problem that she 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.990
 not included not defined 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.170
 by computer 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.170
 let's fix it now 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.660
 first look at the mechanical 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.660
 damage 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:46.020
 Nowhere do we have nothing not filled with water 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:50.570
 Is it possible there are no chips with textolite 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 see here a little bit like that she 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:00.470
 resting on but no follow here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.860
 no, well, now we will ring up 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.320
 connected to the computer and see what 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.299
 LED does not light it does not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.659
 determined we take a multimeter we put in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.659
 measuring mode constant 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.590
 and start calling 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.450
 so 5 volts we have on the first leg 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.850
 but the rest should not be at 1 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:58.320
 should be 5 volts that's how you see with us 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 eat 5 volts means power is coming 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:10.830
 food comes in but why doesn't she 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.830
 nagging means watching carefully 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.240
 where goes 5 volts and we will call on 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.050
 Now I will try to show 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.250
 so I hope it will be seen means 5 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.200
 volts go here I have already closed 5 volts 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.870
 go through the resistor to the controller now 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.520
 we will measure whether it goes on 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.910
 voltage means here we have five volts 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.910
 there is 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.970
 the 5 volt resistor arrives 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.810
 and with a resistor 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 but nothing comes out of the resistor 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 as you can see from the resistor is no longer 0 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 3 volts after the resistor means you can 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:34.650
 suggest that it is out of order 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:45.650
 resistor right now we will try it 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 unsolder and temporarily put the jumper 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.319
 here is this resistor 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.700
 then this resistor we now unsolder a 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.240
 put time here on the jumper and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.570
 See if it works after that. 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:14.140
 Our flash drive or not yet soldering 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.070
 Heated let's take a little look from 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:25.240
 what is 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:27.540
 hut drives means this is in the chip 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.540
 of memory 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.310
 this controller 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.210
 quartz resonator which sets 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.210
 clock frequency 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:52.050
 controller and here's a little strapping 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:55.450
 capacitors on this side are a resistor and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:00.420
 LED which show activity 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:04.360
 work flash drive here this breakdown 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:08.290
 happens often enough for whatever reason 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.480
 I find it difficult to say with me already 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:16.690
 repair was more than 10 flash drives in 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.390
 which the essence of the breakdown was this replacement here 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.510
 this resistor 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.169
 input resistor which stands directly on 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:29.590
 line five volts after replacing this 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.470
 resistor our flash drive should start 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:37.669
 and work normally 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.669
 Well, let's start 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:46.510
 added a bit of flux to this resistor 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.870
 make it easy 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.870
 you are scared 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.080
 let's start 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.980
 as you can see, the whole reason is 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.510
 little parts 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.250
 in a resistor here at this place where it is 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.540
 worth 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.320
 I'll put the usual one in the frame 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.740
 jumper 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:37.490
 for Karachun and see will be after this 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.490
 work our flash drive or not 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.330
 but 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:03.220
 all try now to connect the flash drive to 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:07.870
 computer means connect our icon 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:13.360
 computer and see that the LED 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:16.199
 fired up the computer also identified 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.199
 flash drive 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.470
 here she is 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.000
 here look 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.000
 I have now turned it off 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.890
 it disappears on the computer 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.430
 he appears on mean this 

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:54.800
 jumper 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:58.340
 so you can leave here the best now 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.389
 remove and put in place and and worker 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:06.199
 a resistor so it will be more reliable here and 

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:09.349
 all on this repair is finished all thanks 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:12.219
 for watching subscribe to the channel before 

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:12.219
 see you soon
