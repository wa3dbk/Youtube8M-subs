possible<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.270> know<00:00:53.630> I<00:00:53.660> felt<00:00:53.930> like<00:00:54.170> his

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
possible but you know I felt like his

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.530 
possible but you know I felt like his
desire<00:00:56.000> was<00:00:56.650> extremely<00:00:57.650> high<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:58.970> started

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
desire was extremely high so I started

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.700 
desire was extremely high so I started
to<00:00:59.660> kind<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.900> research<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.290> chocolate

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
to kind of research the chocolate

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.380 
to kind of research the chocolate
industry<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.310> how<00:01:01.400> they<00:01:01.580> make<00:01:01.850> chocolate<00:01:02.270> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
industry and how they make chocolate the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.850 
industry and how they make chocolate the
old-fashioned<00:01:02.930> way<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:03.079> thought<00:01:03.350> why<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.530> want

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
old-fashioned way I thought why I want

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.399 
old-fashioned way I thought why I want
to<00:01:03.890> make<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.280> old-fashioned<00:01:04.939> way<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.409> put

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.440 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put
a<00:01:06.439> lot<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.619> love<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.400> lot<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.610> humility<00:01:08.090> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.510 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and
a<00:01:08.570> lot<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.750> honor<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.470> sacredness<00:01:09.980> into<00:01:10.400> it

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.330 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it
hence<00:01:10.850> sacred<00:01:11.300> chocolate<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.050> we<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.040> kind

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.860 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind
of<00:01:13.370> started<00:01:13.700> playing<00:01:13.940> around<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.420> kitchen<00:01:14.600> at

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
of started playing around the kitchen at

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.149 
of started playing around the kitchen at
first<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.350> then<00:01:15.440> one<00:01:15.560> thing<00:01:15.590> led<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.980> another

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
first and then one thing led to another

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.940 
first and then one thing led to another
and<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:16.760> have<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> chocolate<00:01:17.180> factory

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and now we have a chocolate factory

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.740 
and now we have a chocolate factory
we've<00:01:18.950> really<00:01:19.580> i<00:01:19.790> think<00:01:19.970> spent<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.450> lot<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.630> time

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
we've really i think spent a lot of time

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.830 
we've really i think spent a lot of time
studying<00:01:21.050> alchemy<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.630> sacredness<00:01:23.630> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840

of time studying the field of Ormus
which<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.580> obviously<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:38.000> more<00:01:38.900> conventional

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
which is obviously a more conventional
