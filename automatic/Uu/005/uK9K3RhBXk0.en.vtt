the<00:01:42.689> tournament<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.680> obviously<00:01:43.860> going

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the tournament I think obviously going

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.039 
the tournament I think obviously going
into<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> Sweden<00:01:45.360> game<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.780> were<00:01:45.869> quite

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
into the Sweden game we were quite

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.399 
into the Sweden game we were quite
confident<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.990> happened<00:01:49.320> at

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
confident and I think it it happened at

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
confident and I think it it happened at
the<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.710> time<00:01:49.979> we've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.280> our<00:01:50.399> defeat<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the right time we've got our defeat and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
the right time we've got our defeat and
we'll<00:01:51.540> learn<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> we've<00:01:52.290> reviewed<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
we'll learn from it we've reviewed the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
we'll learn from it we've reviewed the
game<00:01:53.040> we've<00:01:53.460> been<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> learn<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.689> our

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
game we've been the learn from our

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
game we've been the learn from our
mistakes<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.470> take<00:01:55.649> positive<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
mistakes and take positive from the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
mistakes and take positive from the
things<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.909> did<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.619> hopefully

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
things that we did do well and hopefully

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
things that we did do well and hopefully
we'll<00:01:59.460> take<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.820> into<00:02:00.060> our<00:02:00.090> first<00:02:00.479> game<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
we'll take that into our first game and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
we'll take that into our first game and
put<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> things<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.070> didn't<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.430> well

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
put the things that we didn't do well

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.270 
put the things that we didn't do well
right<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.530> then<00:02:04.530> hopefully<00:02:04.920> it'll<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
right and then hopefully it'll go to the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.969 
right and then hopefully it'll go to the
right<00:02:05.340> way<00:02:06.140> it's<00:02:07.140> been<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.530> say<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.860> been

and it's a beautiful little city and a
lot<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.310> do<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:25.820> I'm<00:02:26.660> really<00:02:26.840> enjoying<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.260> had

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
lot to do so I'm really enjoying it had

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.430 
lot to do so I'm really enjoying it had
two<00:02:28.490> tourneys<00:02:28.880> under<00:02:29.330> my<00:02:29.450> belt<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:30.140> their

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
two tourneys under my belt with their

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.560 
two tourneys under my belt with their
world<00:02:30.680> cup<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.160> Olympics<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.090> think

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
world cup and the Olympics and I think

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.950 
world cup and the Olympics and I think
this<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> tournament<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.680> I've<00:02:33.860> come<00:02:34.130> in

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
this is the tournament that I've come in

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.930 
this is the tournament that I've come in
wanting<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.260> do<00:02:36.410> well<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.740> hopefully<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
wanting to do well and hopefully the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390 
wanting to do well and hopefully the
team<00:02:38.150> will<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.630> think<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.500> our<00:02:39.770> year<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.310> I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
team will I think this is our year and I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.250 
team will I think this is our year and I
think<00:02:40.610> we've<00:02:40.730> got<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> right<00:02:41.150> balance<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.960> with

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
think we've got a right balance and with

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.560 
think we've got a right balance and with
experienced<00:02:43.220> players<00:02:43.490> players<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.480> are

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
experienced players players that are

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.940 
experienced players players that are
probably<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.020> middle<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.350> their<00:02:45.590> career

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
probably in the middle of their career

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280 
probably in the middle of their career
and<00:02:46.190> young<00:02:46.430> players<00:02:46.730> who<00:02:46.970> are<00:02:47.120> hungry<00:02:47.300> for<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
and young players who are hungry for the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.350 
and young players who are hungry for the
success<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:49.280> think<00:02:49.790> we've<00:02:50.000> got<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> great

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
success and I think we've got a great

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.750 
success and I think we've got a great
balance<00:02:50.570> at<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.020> moment<00:02:51.380> within<00:02:52.160> our<00:02:52.400> squad

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
balance at the moment within our squad

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.150 
balance at the moment within our squad
and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.210> we're<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:53.990> eager<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.620> well<00:02:54.890> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
and then we're all eager to do well and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.610 
and then we're all eager to do well and
hungry<00:02:55.880> for<00:02:56.090> success<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:57.050> looking

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
hungry for success so I'm looking

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.080 
hungry for success so I'm looking
forward<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:58.070> once<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.460> tournament<00:02:59.030> gets

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
forward to once the tournament gets

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.540 
forward to once the tournament gets
kicked<00:02:59.390> off
