00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.309
 the bell is in zaandijk and even if 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.360
 you there because whoever sometimes goes out 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:20.090
 been away for two years and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.640
 study completed said I was really there 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.650
 very ready to go on vacation 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.660
 yes I say so on holiday auctions 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.390
 my sister really wanted to go to istanbul 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680
 and I was busy with my phone 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.040
 and coincidentally it ' s mine 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.800
 istanbul 3 days 4 days istanbul 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 I thought maybe that is what the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.980
 sisters focus and bought one on the internet 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.060
 fully catered trip to them 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.420
 favorite destination 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.220
 Istanbul they booked 4 weeks before departure 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.280
 but in the end they only paid three 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.870
 weeks later after two reminders melted gravy 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.270
 So I pay and that was ultimately 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.650
 one week before departure 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.850
 they were a little late but they thought 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.850
 still tidy up during his 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.270
 I am freelance and so I have to first 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.710
 wait a while until I do 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.020
 get in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.680
 that turned out to be a mistake on arrival 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.479
 Schiphol 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.189
 the ladies were not allowed to join it 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.750
 check in that the corendon shows 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.310
 tour operator has the ladies' journey 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.049
 canceled 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.270
 but when they call it claims the same 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.270
 travel company that everything will be fine 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.960
 she that gentleman on the phone from 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.749
 corendon from her buy your ticket 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.260
 I can't help it now but before 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:32.410
 so you are a turkey 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 I have arranged it in Istanbul and 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.520
 in return you get your money back 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.230
 purchased your ticket in good faith 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.850
 the ladies new tickets 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.310
 once an istanbul black the hotel too 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.110
 canceled and the ladies had their own 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 arrange accommodation 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.000
 The worst thing I found was that I was up 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.060
 They told us about Istanbul airport 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.190
 completely suffocated 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 so you and imran have paid yourself 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.360
 for the outward journey and hotel istanbul 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.280
 arranged by the travel company 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.750
 do not reimburse costs 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.240
 we present the problem to a lawyer 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.860
 Josanne Venekamp from the Legal Desk 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.660
 I certainly think that have a chance 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 because you can indeed say maybe 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.530
 they have paid late and on the other hand 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.269
 the choir and our being treated continuously 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 as if the customers were and had been 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.780
 travel agreement 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.239
 they have sent him crazy emails to him 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 with content you can know about that way 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.360
 they have all kinds of telephone calls 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.459
 commitments did get a woman to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.380
 log in to her at the very last moment 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.360
 booking site 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.849
 so i believe that customer is themselves 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.989
 rightly stated 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.640
 and if I have one 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.580
 travel agreement that you cannot just do that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 cancel and leave me at Schiphol 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.349
 time to get a story from corendon de 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.130
 travel company believes that they are the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.360
 cancellation 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.920
 clearly communicated and the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
 spokesperson who cordially receives us 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.480
 says the sisters have a message from 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.610
 have received a cancellation 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.019
 sisters say afterwards indeed one 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.630
 to have found an e-mail with the title 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.739
 cancellation invoice but emails 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.780
 very unclear 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.459
 your trip is not canceled anywhere 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.700
 because you have now paid or something 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.700
 such a nature 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.569
 This is not going to be an attachment 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.390
 at will by e-mail in which clear 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.640
 It is stated that this is a cancellation of 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.590
 after all, a booking is clear 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.790
 clear when you go all the way down 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.310
 scrolls 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.690
 and even more and down 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.859
 scrolls down in the attachment 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.700
 of the e-mail 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.040
 do you read cancellation and a 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.060
 Text amount here missing your 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.069

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.120

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.850

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.010
 what is the conclusion of this story about 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.569
 dealing with the weather 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.790
 Well the conclusion of the story seems 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.819
 very clear to me that madam by us 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.060
 covering letter to our e-mail 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.030

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.310
