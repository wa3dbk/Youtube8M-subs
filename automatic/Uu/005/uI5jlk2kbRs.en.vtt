00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.100
 that so many fans this time to the homologous sounds and in this one 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.859
 review that this and other formulas 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.869
 classics also extracted 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.439
 two desert 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.799
 and so make them point because practically the transformer is the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.089
 same 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 that same flight in this case of edgar serious part 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 it's a good one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.999
 I like colors 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.879
 it really looks like a formula 1 more like Formula 1 vehicles 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:30.729
 It is very 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.200
 in colors and everything practically closed very well 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 i well this wine from guajaca 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.540
 this melo did not sell it to me 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.090
 friend who took 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.580
 autochthonous as we have success youtube 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.590
 i 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.860
 in this case he who came from the United States 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760
 and that is also a good piece is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.900
 Brazil 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 This is what a part of the exhibitors writes 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.330
 and as you can see this triple suits practically the same version 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.450
 what 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.930
 how easy and logically that this one the same version 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 I want it to be him 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.759
 that's practically were copies of these from this mount 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.100
 the truth that we are from the perspective is very good 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.060
 and I think that I am going that is what contributed to these figures coming out and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.230
 sell well 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.620
 and they are very good 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.800
 practically those that the transformation of both figures is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.860
 practically the same 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 quito is like I said good graffiti thing like I'm not a fan of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.440
 the repainted ground to repeat 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.100
 over the fact after seeing that our revisions 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.950
 but what I do think is that some repaint if it's worth it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.980
 but only when they are figures 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.100
 that this is that they were part of the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.940
 of the series than those of the g1 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.520
 because I say this because bharti airtel many repainted as for example in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.270
 this same vision version 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.010
 there is also the repainting of this version of 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.090
 we do not know 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.779
 is what this region is called I think that 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.499
 the edition a crack 20 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.469
 but let that impede 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.760
 and then the truth 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.349
 it does not convince me much 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.489
 this version of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.510
 it's like transparent I think yes that of najera seen one of you 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.099
 the answers that is upside down 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.500
 I want you every time you are true that transaction 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.769
 and the truth is that discomfort 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.269
 simply for being a tenth special edition and all its roll 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.239
 but assumed 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.699
 white with black without a male year 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.269
 completely transparent 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.359
 i poetry 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.849
 it is sold very expensive 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.129
 very limited 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.959
 above 70 or 80 dollars 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.959
 good that we already have armed one of them that exists 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.279
 sure you are investigating this figure 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.389
 what interests me to know if it was simply a goal painted nothing more 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.409
 apparently its maintenance 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.599
 have a female desert 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.390
 and well the truth is very well the detail that I liked very much of the face 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.020
 with his white eyes and face 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.989
 rosazul very well 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.839
 I really liked this figure 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.150
 so another figure is that of other plastic figures 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.779
 it's part 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.499
 of the silly 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.359
 the theater group created by subway to have a little bit more of 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.809
 of advantage min esteche 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.469
 of advantage in him 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:38.899
 on the road 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.899
 you will remember that lipsky floor 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.199
 practically alone the mere mere enemies of the 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.569
 aeal bots 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.989
 and well, there between sides 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.019
 between the vehicles because some vehicles products and the truck 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.209
 master bikes 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.259
 this one was to be followed 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.739
 that it was a yellow car by mule one that steals it 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.229
 I do not know if deceased 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.169
 two diamonds 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.709
 I do not know which of those two bugs steals this car 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.379
 they climb it and in the middle of the race they take it and then they thought to do this 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.219
 desert 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.049
 blake explained 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.849
 what I said was a 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.849
 a good figure is still disgusting because it is based on a mold 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.590
 that was pulpo pulhac like the one with the sights 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.629
 and practically the conversation is the same 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.100
 even the most probable weapons 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.029
 what he brings 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.439
 the g3 also come logically aja these figures 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.439
 and so 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.629
 As I tell you, they are very good 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.199
 that you get a TV of facts that came in a black box 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.129
 that are also clear and is also cover girl what the review 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.279
 in another video and there's also the 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.309
 chimera optimus pad but 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.569
 these are two figures desert what 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.259
 I'm very glad to have it because in the classic series, there is almost no 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.469
 decepticons 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.889
 so I can say 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.300
 confirm these two for what 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.539
 that the forces of a leveling agreement are very good are the 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.770
 I recommend a lot 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.629
 pending taxes for television currency
