 goats today we bring you a series of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 Tips for those who

 are going to introduce in the world cabril or 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.830
 some the world of the bastards to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 so be it is like paris hilton and sub 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.380
 cable in your bag 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 of course my goat so that from a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 once for all you can be happy with 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.800
 our goat that serves both the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.660
 vehicle as of animal said as of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.770
 pet animal like this animal 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.770
 video we go with the video 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.130
 today 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.080
 bear in mind that our goat 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.480
 animal to walk around house because you already know 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 that then the goat shoots to the mount then 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.700
 it's not like another animal type pigs birds 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.860
 but having at home you give him love and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.740
 this is not the goat it is difficult to hug us or 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.660
 you have to catch the point because between 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.120
 the horns and such as it is not very 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 common then you have a relationship with 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.990
 space that is not going to do like the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.880
 typical dog you get home and you 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.590
 receive and moving the tail because in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.140
 first place is robberies were small 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.940
 pilgrimages then you can name it 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.800
 but I would be able to call it so 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 different because the goat cares 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.480
 shit as you call it 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 remember that the goats are active and 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.409
 Above all they need our attention 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.390
 you must keep in mind what they say well 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.010
 is stubborn like a goat and date 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.870
 account that the goats do not respond to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.430
 the hard discipline you have to treat them 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.760
 with love and affection so that 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.920
 respond positively after 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.900
 those caresses ironing the hair give them of 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.260
 eat or those things that are done in the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.260
 goats 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.819
 remember that the goat is an animal that 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.920
 he likes bull and what he's going to 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.600
 need a lot of space 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.310
 is a garden patio and let us try to 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.770
 That place is fenced with fences 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 Electrified nonstop crazy because 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.400
 sometimes the goats become violent 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.930
 attack and tear people's arms 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.140
 then you have to be prudent and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 caution be where we zegarra 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.770
 sorry we have a load in catro 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.810
 carrier please keep in mind 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.580
 that you need a shelter for your goat 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.350
 if you want to have it as a pet and you 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.340
 you will say why they need a 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.340
 shelter my goat 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.440
 obviously we need to protect the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.270
 wool of our goats and the rain and the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.770
 bad weather nobody wants that 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.510
 a radio falls on top of the camera 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.450
 and we all know the disappearances of 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.700
 the flying goats agreed to 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.500
 Always feed and drink your 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.080
 goat they really like hay and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.060
 grass so it uses those of mower 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.040
 is the example that most goat the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.930
 back legs and the cane that cuts you 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.910
 grass and hedges if we put ourselves to it 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.260
 he also likes grains there is nothing 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.260
 better than if you have a teenage son 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.870
 the black dots no longer throw him so much 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.870
 because it's like when you put long 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.870
 make your goat happy with delights 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.150
 specials such as pieces of fruit from 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.510
 vegetables or pieces of hedge where I 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.510
 I put it on 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.710
 keep the prawns and the payment for 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.300
 special occasions like his birthday 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.190
 or Christmas because you have to emphasize that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.340
 Faces can be overweight and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.320
 nobody wants a goat that rolls out to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.270
 walk your goat to load your 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.370
