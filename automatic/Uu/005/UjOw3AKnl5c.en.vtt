00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 ok so only 30 years nobody would have known to go to this object and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.829
 much less the kind of wonders that could be done with it 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.960
 good times change 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.080
 it's hard to imagine a modern home an office without at least one of these 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.569
 evolutionary apparatus 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.130
 tic tac tic tac 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 in assembling a computer it takes about 90 minutes the hard drive saves during 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.820
 long the information that has been transmitted to you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 the electoral head in the information 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 is extremely accurate between the read head and the hard drive 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.270
 one hair fits 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.540
 the hard drive is installed in its position inside the computer 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 there are two other units that store information 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.850
 the 3-inch disc reader and the cd rom reader that allows reading 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 and execution of programs recorded on compact discs 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.530
 Baghdad these two units are placed in their position 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.730
 5 the backbone of the computer is the motherboard 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.090
 the rest of the elements of the computer are connected to this unit 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.520
 this fan disperses the heat generated by the guys 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.790
 some sound cards are integrated directly on the motherboard 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.150
 these connections in order are the audio input the output and the port 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 of the microphone 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.390
 this event 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 is the slot in which graphic cards are inserted 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.939
 this thermal device measures the temperature and clear between the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.120
 processor and motherboard 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.710
 the processor is the brain of the system 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.660
 interpret calculated and execute the instructions that it receives 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.730
 the processor has several million transistors and their lack of speed 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.930
 of work reaches already the gigahertz 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 the processor rests on this basis 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.670
 the processor fan 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.029
 scatter heat 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.769
 Its effectiveness depends on the type of material used and a conductive material 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 ensures better cooling 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.419
 ram stores information in the short term but deletes it when 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.859
 disconnect the current 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.489
 this memory is faster than the hard disk hello of the cd rom 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:33.519
 The next step is to put everything in the housing that protects the elements 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.259
 internal of the external elements 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.099
 in this phase the electronic components are installed in the housing 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.919
 Several casing connectors are connected to the motherboard as the 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
 commutator and several light indicators 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.760
 this is the output of the video card that connects the computer to the monitor 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.959
 we also see the video chip that creates images in 2010 three dimensions 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.409
 this is the video memory 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.230
 The greater their capacity, the clearer the image that appears in the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.189
 monitor 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.049
 the video card is placed in its position 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.879
 the modem allows communication between computers their capacitors produce 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 a very clear telephone signal to facilitate communications 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.040
 these modem capacitors control the information circulating between 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.769
 computers 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.719
 the fax modem is installed 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.089
 the power supply transforms the electricity according to the required voltage 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.169
 for the different components 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:50.829
 Blanchard is placed the internal wiring of the computer thanks to him the 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.829
 information circulates between the different media and the motherboard 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.399
 the cable is connected and in fact and the cd rom 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.939
 Finally, the last electric cables are connected to the different 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.939
 components 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.779
 after a puncture 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.409
 has already completed the assembly of the 30 components of the computer 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.070
 the raar the casing 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.790
 All computers are checked to verify the operation of the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.939
 peripherals 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.330
 then they are closed and packed 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.490
 This factory produces about 300 computers a day
