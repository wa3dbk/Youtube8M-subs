00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.120
 this time in bytes we get a detector 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.790
 of spy cameras and spy microphones 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.160
 here we have the box show us the 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.160
 things you can find 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:47.870
 we have a rigid box that we see that 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.309
 contains contains a hearing aids 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.660
 we will be able to connect to the detector 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.969
 so that it does not emit any kind of noise 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.050
 you put this on and you can 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.950
 start looking 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.449
 includes its eliminator 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.750
 since the battery is rechargeable 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.680
 and also includes the manuals of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 user 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.750
 okay 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.560
 let's analyze the good camera detector 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.560
 here we have it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 includes a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.570
 popular 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.490
 there is the compass 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:44.229
 here he's going to tell us how strong he is 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.689
 the frequency of where it is capturing 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.030
 has an antenna to amplify the 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.450
 power is really very strong 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.159
 here we have some leds to learn the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.460
 let's see now to learn them today 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.479
 it emits light and you to see from 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.479
 this little window 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.610
 they will see the reflection of the lenses of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.440
 the spy cameras is very simple 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.740
 you anticipate rules you can learn it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.430
 because as you can see 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.220
 on this side we have until here is 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.730
 off here in the center emits 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.800
 noise in the dakar emits vibrations 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.580
 from here you are going to adjust 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.750
 this intense want it to be him 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.740
 the spies and from here you nothing else 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.620
 with him to load him 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.490
 detector connect us and ready now what 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490
 can put to load 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.520
 from this side 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.370
 and on the 2.5 mm jack for 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 connect friends in the microphones 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.360
 hearing aids that come included 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.000
 and well basically it 's all we're going to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.000
 put it in the engine on 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.090
 because it is already on it is turned on 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.640
 here a blue led 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.610
 good for you are worried about 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.050
 director of cameras 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.050
 we see it they learn it 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.660
 they come back they shine and they make 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 that are reflected in the spy cameras 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.660
 then you should have a more vision 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.660
 or less equal to this 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.960
 then when there is a camera 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.590
 in front 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.900
 the lens will shine then for that 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.020
 is for the slow the brightness and you 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.320
 quickly identify ok 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:56.040
 how to detect that there is a spy microphone 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.300
 well just activate the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.450
 with this 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.650
 with the bec and they are going up according to what 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.920
 so strong they want him to be 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.730
 detector then then put a level 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.480
 intermediate 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.199
 but if you take out more the plan tena 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.100
 is much stronger is the double ok 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:25.240
 then you approach this either 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.910
 walls or cushions to places where 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.270
 there is nothing electronic then you 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.350
 about it and if there is not any kind of 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.490
 looks of this type or any kind of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.040
 noise means that there is absolutely no 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.100
 nothing but if there is a noise like this 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.240
 means that there is a microphone or a 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:55.400
 battery or there's something electronic in that 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.980
 cushion on that stuffed toy there's something like that ok 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.950
 you want to make noise nothing more 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:05.700
 they put it we have up 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.680
 and right now he's in vibrator mode he spoke 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.680
 bring the camera closer so they listen 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.379
 is in vibration mode 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.569
 can occupy the two options either 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.930
 camera and microphone detector at the same 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.930
 weather 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.240
 and good in the partners you give 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.870
 is this 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:39.440
 the one that you most even come 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.410
 Can detect cameras can detect 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.290
 microphones can detect pills 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.190
 you can also detect with this same 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.950
 with the noise of this here 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.590
 can detect if a cell phone is 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.249
 making an account call is in 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.119
 cellular let's put an example 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:04.199
 this is a cell phone is the cell phone and 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:07.599
 entered a call or make a call 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.339
 it automatically turns on like that because 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.029
 this detects the frequencies 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:15.369
 electromagnetic then any 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.609
 thing that emit frequencies 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:17.609
 electromagnetic 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.060
 what is going to activate then you can 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.190
 enlarge 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.700
 the power in case they have a place 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.520
 open or can reduce the descending 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.340
 from the place where you are 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.050
 and well this product can be 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.050
