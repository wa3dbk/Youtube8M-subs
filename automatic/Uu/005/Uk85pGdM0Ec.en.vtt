00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.400
 now I continue with the second part of the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.889
 video related to the comparison between the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.700
 high intensity systems and ad systems 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.040
 high volume 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.380
 growth theory 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.570
 muscle that I found so well exposed 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.579
 in mike pence's books it was simple 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.090
 intuitive clear and consistent with the data 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.470
 available scientific transform 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.300
 body building from an activity 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.670
 improvised to a real one 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.489
 science mike wasn't afraid to say 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.929
 analyze disassemble step by step i 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.399
 fundamentals on which rested the 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.739
 bodybuilding ie a set of 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.710
 more or less superstitions and legends 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.750
 badly adaptable and readjusted 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.390
 from the sorcerers of the billy bo to each 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.129
 single case but then why all 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.850
 large samples used systems 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.730
 high volume 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.230
 the answer was very simple mike 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 through his training system 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.019
 which he called waste and who did 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.480
 rested on the three short intense principles 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.370
 and infrequently it was one of the very first to 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.350
 consider the human organism as a 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.720
 system that needed time well 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.880
 definable to make it succeed in 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.340
 compensate first and up to compensate then 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.950
 I follow following a stress is 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.740
 imposed what the magazines 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.500
 samples of samples are forgotten or 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.259
 make us say is that everyone and I say 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.450
 all at high levels in the bill of 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.670
 they use doping drugs that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.590
 they improve exponentially and understand them 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.100
 the ability to recover and regenerate 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.409
 physique of an athlete an athlete doped not 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.869
 need to have to wait many days 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.399
 between one session and the next because i 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.409
 his because his levels of 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.049
 testosterone increase and those of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.630
 cortisol simply decrease 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.920
 introducing hormones from the outside bypasses 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.509
 the problem 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.100
 also the amount of hormones that 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.859
 they are used in body building 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.990
 modern is such that super in some cases 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.390
 dozens and dozens of times the normals 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 endogenous productions on the one hand we have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.869
 therefore a man who must through 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 nutrition training e 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.490
 the integration try to optimize to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 maximum what nature gave him e 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.660
 on the other, one that not only does that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.190
 just don't have to worry about how much 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.900
 how much when and how to train 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.870
 but who has constantly present in the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.690
 blood hormone levels of testosterone 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.860
 gh somatomedina c insulin and more 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.830
 put it more 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.390
 from tyrannosaurus rex it is clear that the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.610
 first will have to use techniques of 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.530
 nutrition training such that 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.840
 take the limited into consideration 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.760
 capacity and resources available 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.530
 while the second will be able to do what 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.310
 wants seen that its potential of 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.710
 recovery is literally superhuman vi 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.360
 remember that anabolic steroids 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.030
 were used by the Nazis in the camps of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.520
 concentration in large quantities for 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.560
 allow undernourished men and places 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.750
 in conditions of stress and work a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.000
 To say the least extreme to continue to 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.970
 work to the death without warning 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.130
 too high fatigue techniques 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.770
 volume used for the mass increase 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.570
 muscle go completely against 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.130
 what are the premises that are 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.890
 at the base of physiology and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.780
 muscle recovery time ago fibers 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.760
 muscles were cataloged in fibers 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.910
 red and white fibers 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.050
 the first are few for skillful trophies 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.880
 characterized by a high density of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.010
 capillaries so great but 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.850
 numerous schooling mitochondria 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.780
 hemoglobin my goblin to lawful konomi 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.940
 necessary for oxygen transport 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.340
 which will serve to optimize use 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.620
 of fats as an energy substrate 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.560
 their characteristic is preferential 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.750
 main quality is resistance 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.459
 this they express through 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.130
 constant slow contractions for periods 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.230
 long time the white fever instead 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.860
 they grow more easily in size 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.140
 ie only hypertrophied and are 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.780
 capable of powerful rapid contractions 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.760
 expressible in short periods of time the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.960
 subtract their reference energy 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.180
 and the atp already present in the ipad n 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.400
 already present free in the muscle or the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.040
 glucose are characterized by 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.600
 inability to endure for a high 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.850
 work intensity for long periods 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.320
 of time 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.420
 if the white fibers are those for 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.770
 skillful trophÃ©es and therefore we must strike 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.050
 mostly during ours 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.060
 workouts to increase the volume of 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.220
 our muscles and if those fibers are 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.750
 subject to rapid powerful contractions 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.210
 for short periods of time 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.890
 it follows that if our training 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.320
 it will be too long 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.330
 red fibers will be the ones that are not 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.390
 hypertrophied to be more where 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.060
 more involved a high intensity of 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.940
 work is inversely proportional 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.310
 length of training time 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.230
 therefore to very long workouts must 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.570
 inevitably correspond one 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.280
 low labor intensity and living 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.130
 Muscles involved are mainly 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.570
 the red ones the slow contraction you see 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.090
 the marathon for example 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.790
 on the other hand a very high level of training 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.270
 intensity must by definition unfold 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.360
 in a short span of time, for example, 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.160
 100 meters of race if it is true as it is true 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.920
 that muscle growth is nothing else 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.930
 that normal organic adaptation to one 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.000
 imposed stress is also true that such 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.960
 stress cannot be imposed for more 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.180
 times in a row 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.580
 once the threshold of 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.740
 adaptation activation and created it 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.020
 there must be no other stimulus 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.000
 additional stares on lengthening 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.790
 of the normal recovery times 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.740
 physiological functions and delay in 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.440
 stories of the lights burned so much 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.540
 researched adaptation processes that is 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.920
 of muscle growth 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.600
 every time we train with 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.470
 a maximum intensity in ours 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.120
 body 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.810
 we create a real storm of 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.450
 events that in turn will bring one 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.880
 right hormonal production suitable for one 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.950
 part on one side to repair the damage 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.660
 that we have provoked and on the other 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.820
 put the organism in conditions of 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.240
 better to bear a hypothetical new 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.310
 pressure episode since 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.690
 which we have available are not unlimited 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.550
 we must respect the times that the 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.050
 our body requires us 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.060
 and it is precisely in these conditions that 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.200
 intense and brief short workouts 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.580
 Frequently 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.260
 they are better suited to be 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.330
 used 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.950
 vice versa if we do not need to 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.800
 wait for our hormone levels 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.870
 yes, we are thirsty because we use 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.840
 all sorts of hormones available on the 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.530
 market so as to bypass normal 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.210
 answers and normal biological times 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.210
 every rule I discussed above 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.140
 becomes irrelevant if through the use of 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.100
 drugs we create a napoli with co 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.230
 tenfold our capacities of 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.970
 then any adaptation recovery 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.950
 type of training and nutrition 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.040
 go well 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.990
 here end the second part of the video e 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.030
 I give you an appointment in a few days 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.180
 to the third part thanks again for having me 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.180
 following
