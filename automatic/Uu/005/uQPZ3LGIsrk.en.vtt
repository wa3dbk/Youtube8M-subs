00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
ultra 2 and the old one I was using was

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
ultra 2 and the old one I was using was
a<00:01:31.170> flip<00:01:31.439> ultra<00:01:31.860> original<00:01:32.369> generation<00:01:33.350> because

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a flip ultra original generation because

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
a flip ultra original generation because
Walmart<00:01:34.829> didn't<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
Walmart didn't have the two but I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
Walmart didn't have the two but I
exchange<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.920> got<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> better<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
exchange them got the better one so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.230 
exchange them got the better one so
hopefully<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.600> works<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:41.240> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
hopefully this works out pretty good so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
hopefully this works out pretty good so
it's<00:01:42.390> evident<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.990> record<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.829> recorded<00:01:44.759> the

cannons on the shoulders that they can
pivot<00:02:45.819> around<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.189> could<00:02:48.340> go<00:02:48.489> under<00:02:48.819> his

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
pivot around just I could go under his

arms if you wanted them to for some

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.460

reason<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.629> fold<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.109> way<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:55.349> bunch<00:02:56.349> of

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
reason it can fold that way a bunch of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.649 
reason it can fold that way a bunch of
other<00:02:56.650> ways<00:02:57.959> he's<00:02:58.959> got<00:02:59.760> stable<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.909> stabilizer

other ways he's got stable a stabilizer

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.190 
other ways he's got stable a stabilizer
for<00:03:02.079> his<00:03:02.530> legs<00:03:02.769> right<00:03:03.519> here<00:03:04.049> which<00:03:05.049> is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
for his legs right here which is

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.059 
for his legs right here which is
something<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:05.680> wish<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.730> universe<00:03:07.120> count<00:03:07.419> head

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
something I wish the universe count head

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.679 
something I wish the universe count head
maybe<00:03:09.069> allows<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.760> lot<00:03:09.939> easier<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.359> stand

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689

that<00:03:10.930> way<00:03:11.639> elbow<00:03:12.639> articulation<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:16.560> like

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that way elbow articulation and like

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.759 
that way elbow articulation and like
halfway<00:03:17.949> down<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.340> arm<00:03:18.840> articulation<00:03:19.840> he's

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
halfway down the arm articulation he's

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.809 
halfway down the arm articulation he's
got<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.340> forward<00:03:21.940> joint<00:03:23.069> here<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.310> then<00:03:24.489> one

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
got a forward joint here and then one

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.379 
got a forward joint here and then one
right<00:03:25.090> here<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:27.280> his<00:03:27.430> arms<00:03:27.699> can<00:03:27.849> do<00:03:28.000> all<00:03:28.120> kind

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
right here so his arms can do all kind

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.289 
right here so his arms can do all kind
of<00:03:28.449> funky<00:03:28.780> things<00:03:30.329> he's<00:03:31.329> got<00:03:31.540> at<00:03:31.629> the<00:03:31.810> shoulder

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.599 
of funky things he's got at the shoulder
and<00:03:34.299> then<00:03:35.169> they<00:03:35.319> can<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.919> because<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
and then they can go in because of the

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.849 
and then they can go in because of the
hinge<00:03:37.120> sorry<00:03:38.109> about<00:03:38.229> that<00:03:38.260> hinge<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.739> the

just peg those together flip the
stabilizers<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:27.520> these<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:28.580> fold<00:04:29.210> up

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
stabilizers in and these just fold up

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.219 
stabilizers in and these just fold up
like<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:32.740> his<00:04:33.740> chest<00:04:34.340> panel<00:04:34.699> comes<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.990> like

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
like so his chest panel comes up like

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.879 
like so his chest panel comes up like
this<00:04:37.120> then<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.270> just<00:04:38.599> bring<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.500> legs<00:04:39.710> up

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889

this then you just bring the legs up
until<00:04:40.520> they<00:04:41.180> fit<00:04:41.479> together<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:43.030> bring

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
until they fit together like that bring

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.740 
until they fit together like that bring
his<00:04:44.180> head<00:04:44.389> down<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:47.530> then<00:04:48.530> just<00:04:48.800> kind<00:04:49.070> of

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
his head down like so then just kind of

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.379 
his head down like so then just kind of
position<00:04:50.750> his<00:04:50.900> arms<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.190> they're<00:04:52.970> flush

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
position his arms so that they're flush

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.510 
position his arms so that they're flush
and<00:04:53.720> look<00:04:53.900> like<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> door<00:04:56.740> do<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.949> on<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.250> side

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
and look like a door do that on the side

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.969 
and look like a door do that on the side
too<00:05:01.449> and<00:05:02.449> then<00:05:02.960> just<00:05:03.260> kind<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.590> push<00:05:03.800> them

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
too and then just kind of push them

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.820 
too and then just kind of push them
together<00:05:04.900> until<00:05:05.900> he<00:05:06.320> all<00:05:08.320> he<00:05:09.320> all<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.710> was

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
together until he all he all that was

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.350 
together until he all he all that was
funny<00:05:10.120> he<00:05:11.120> fits<00:05:11.840> into<00:05:12.139> place<00:05:13.180> it'll<00:05:14.180> take<00:05:14.210> a

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
funny he fits into place it'll take a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.939 
funny he fits into place it'll take a
little<00:05:14.539> bit<00:05:14.659> of<00:05:14.750> working<00:05:15.169> because<00:05:15.320> nothing

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
little bit of working because nothing

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.370 
little bit of working because nothing
really<00:05:16.340> locks<00:05:16.699> in<00:05:17.090> all<00:05:17.690> too<00:05:17.930> well<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.139> this<00:05:18.440> guy

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
really locks in all too well on this guy

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.460 
really locks in all too well on this guy
so<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.440> just<00:05:21.650> kind<00:05:21.830> of<00:05:21.919> kind<00:05:22.639> of<00:05:22.880> kind<00:05:23.470> of

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
so you just kind of kind of kind of

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.839 
so you just kind of kind of kind of
position<00:05:25.039> things<00:05:25.340> until<00:05:25.789> they<00:05:25.909> fit<00:05:26.270> like<00:05:30.849> I'm

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
position things until they fit like I'm

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
you can looks like I believe it was a

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.320

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
sector 7 dune buggy thing he's obviously

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.650 
sector 7 dune buggy thing he's obviously
nest<00:06:55.900> designated<00:06:57.640> instead<00:06:58.640> of<00:06:58.730> sector<00:06:59.030> 7<00:06:59.390> but

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
nest designated instead of sector 7 but

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.420 
nest designated instead of sector 7 but
same<00:07:00.020> concept<00:07:00.560> pretty<00:07:00.740> much<00:07:03.130> he's<00:07:04.130> another

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
same concept pretty much he's another

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.800 
same concept pretty much he's another
