00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.960
 more and more in difficulty 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.520
 they are only three Lille for 5 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.050
 Ajaccians from this center of the EU

 mark against his side the lack of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.500
 defense communication illustrated by 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.479
 the anticipation of mathieu chalme and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 the former Lille closes the pass 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.700
 back and leaves the field open to

 period 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.350
 ajaccio push to come back and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.390
 the equalization only goes to a few 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.479
 centimeters on this center-shot of mehdi

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.550
 oliech passes close to his third 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.350
 goal in five games with the CIA is Lille 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 in difficulty and the inhabitants of Lille 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.899
 complicate a little more the task after this 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.580
 big tackle of lucas worthy 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.350
 the left lateral arrives from behind and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.350
 late and he is logically expelled 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.670
 by benoît bastien to ten against eleven to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.180
 lille succeeds, however, in 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.979
 differences 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.040
 Lille will offer the same cons 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.170
 in numerical superiority 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.360

 duel won by Lille goalkeeper 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.269
 Lille plays the counter thoroughly despite 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.129
 the expulsion of lucas worthy the losc 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.530
 arrives in numerical superiority in the 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.269
 the penalty area Ajaccio 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.750
 solutions are multiple for dimitri 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.450
 payet 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 he chooses the simplest 10th goal of the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.940
 season for the former Saint Etienne 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.290
 a goal that definitely seals the outcome 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.849
 of the meeting a quarter of an hour from 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.890
 term to two minutes later 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.230
 belghazouani is finally rewarded for his 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.610
 efforts perfectly served by oliech he 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 find the opposite skylight of steeve

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.680
 during the game 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.480
 the strike of the old auxerrois is 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.459
 countered in extremis by the return of 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 laurent bonnart 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.850
