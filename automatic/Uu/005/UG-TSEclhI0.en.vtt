00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 Y 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.380
 hello everyone my name is Laura and as 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 you know I'm Colombian today 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.180
 today they are with a video with 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.070
 very good indeed are three 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
 ideas so that the nails come out 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.520
 they are super easy because actually 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.349
 I kind of feel bad about that 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.510
 do with my nails because I have a 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.700
 very bad pulse because it's like the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.220
 right is excellent and the left of 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.630
 this one until here painted then it needed 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 I think it happens to all the women but 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 I actually like it better 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 only we need are enamels and the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 glazes more needs that you have as 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.360
 for example the black and white thing those 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 are the enamels that more like that more 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.820
 they need this tutorial tutorial use 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.890
 enamels does not say I hope you like it and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.080
 I hope you subscribe before you see it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:06.329
 so watch the video and tell me in 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:09.240
 comments that you think first before 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.970
 that everything apply an English base to your 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.340
 nails since I 'm going to allow with 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.750
 our land 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 then apply the white enamel 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.280
 now let's review colored fonts 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.149
 different you want and the colors 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.149
 what you want 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.230
 let's make the 'animal print' I 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.140
 I pretend it's a very important parenthesis 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.590
 chubby with points around or as 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.590
 little 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.870
 but but as my purple got on 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.570
 I said rebel and they want to see you apply 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.440
 yellow to make them look prettier and 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.440
 look good 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.450
 the yellow that I have I have as 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.750
 many glitter and that makes it look even 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 plus 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.650
 then we take a sponge and apply it 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 glazes over and then we put it on 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.560
 our nails to touch very soft 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.840
 or as you want and then we are going to remove 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.840
 the excess with a cotton or cotton 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.689
 Now let's do the same 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.219
 fat braces alone than before 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.180
 do this let's apply shine 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.120
 drying 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.150
 I did not have but apply it stayed very 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.209
 cute and then again apply it for 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.209
 to quote and remove the enamel and ready 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.489
 this is the easiest idea to throw 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.349
 enamel blanc 4 zones and then you do the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.510
 animal of the colors that you want 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.670
 this one looks like very pretty and it was like 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.620
 very simple, it does not look so remembered 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.099
 you can do it in all the nails are the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.099
 grounds 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.630
 and as I told you throughout the whole 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.430
 video subscribe remember that in the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.120
 week uploads a video but can change 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.840
 so I can upload two so be 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.160
 slopes 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.260
 I have two social networks that are 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.320
 instagram my life in photos and twitter with 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.320
 messages 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.360
 since nobody tells me what to do for the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.290
 next video, believe me I'm not going 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.290
 to ask never ever 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.060
 Many kisses and many giant hugs
