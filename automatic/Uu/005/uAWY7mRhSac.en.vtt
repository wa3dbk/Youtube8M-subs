problem<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.720> book<00:00:21.930> covers<00:00:22.289> stems<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
problem with book covers stems from the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
problem with book covers stems from the
fact<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.670> usually<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> author

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.150 
making the final decision on the cover
it's<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.269> publisher<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.320> often<00:00:28.529> feel<00:00:28.949> that

it's the publisher and I often feel that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.740 
it's the publisher and I often feel that
the<00:00:29.250> publisher<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.939> trying<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.449> pigeonhole

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
trying to imagine the scenario that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
trying to imagine the scenario that
leads<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.240> typically<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.170> these

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
leads up to this typically in these

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
leads up to this typically in these
cases<00:02:04.590> he<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.579> been<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.969> sword

fight<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.960> gotten<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> hot<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.039> sweaty<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.910> he

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
fight and gotten a hot and sweaty so he

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.960 
fight and gotten a hot and sweaty so he
throws<00:02:09.420> open<00:02:09.869> his<00:02:10.140> shirt<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.649> cool

throws open his shirt to cool

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.420 
throws open his shirt to cool

and so he's all unselfconsciously sexy
right<00:02:13.640> well<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.150> guy<00:02:14.330> takes<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.750> step

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
right well this guy takes it a step

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.440

further and tucks his shirt in but in
such<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.690> way<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> would<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.530> be

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
such a way that it would have to be

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.540 
such a way that it would have to be
awkward<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.160> his

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
awkward to do and to make it so that his

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.810 
awkward to do and to make it so that his
chest<00:02:22.940> remains<00:02:23.510> exposed<00:02:23.990> at<00:02:24.590> all<00:02:24.710> times<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.700> we

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
chest remains exposed at all times so we

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.210 
chest remains exposed at all times so we
go<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.180> being<00:02:26.350> unselfconsciously<00:02:27.350> sexy<00:02:27.890> to

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
go from being unselfconsciously sexy to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.760 
go from being unselfconsciously sexy to
being<00:02:28.640> consciously<00:02:29.390> douchey<00:02:30.050> now<00:02:30.470> let's<00:02:30.650> talk
