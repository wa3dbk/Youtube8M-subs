00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
smudge it in put my brush in it but you
can<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.549> an

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
can see that only that much is an

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
can see that only that much is an
eyeliner<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> lot<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.369> if

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
eyeliner so it's not a lot I guess if

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.030 
eyeliner so it's not a lot I guess if
you<00:01:59.700> don't<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> brush<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:01.040> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
you don't use much on the brush then it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
you don't use much on the brush then it
will<00:02:02.159> last<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.579> yeah<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.899> looks

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
will last you yeah that's what it looks

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160 
will last you yeah that's what it looks
like<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> yeah<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.899> try

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
like so yeah I will now get on and try

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
like so yeah I will now get on and try
this<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.580> amazing<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.929> it's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this out and if I'm amazing then it's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.660 
this out and if I'm amazing then it's
just<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:10.860> I've<00:02:11.009> never<00:02:11.250> used<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> before

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
just because I've never used it before

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.870 
just because I've never used it before
but<00:02:12.270> I'll<00:02:12.660> probably<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> video

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
but I'll probably do a video

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.320 
but I'll probably do a video
in<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> week<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.650> showing<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.340> think

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
in about a week or so showing I think

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
in about a week or so showing I think
but<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:18.870> my<00:02:19.370> impression<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> has

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
but then if my impression of it has

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.970 
but then if my impression of it has
changed<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> let's<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.860> the

would be to make the consistency

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.779 
would be to make the consistency
slightly<00:04:39.139> less<00:04:40.139> dry<00:04:40.470> because<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.160> have<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.610> kind
