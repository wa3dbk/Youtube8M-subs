recognize that the time for being able
to<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> really

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
to do what we do which is really

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.569 
to do what we do which is really
comprehensively<00:00:50.910> profiling<00:00:51.690> cancer<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
comprehensively profiling cancer and in

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.139 
comprehensively profiling cancer and in
patient's<00:00:54.360> individual<00:00:54.780> tumors<00:00:55.489> was<00:00:56.489> was

patient's individual tumors was was

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
patient's individual tumors was was
right<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
right and and this is because of really

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
right and and this is because of really
a<00:00:59.340> convergence<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.390> technology<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
a convergence of technology like the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.549 
a convergence of technology like the
next-generation<00:01:01.890> sequencing<00:01:02.550> technology

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
next-generation sequencing technology

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
next-generation sequencing technology
and<00:01:04.559> computational<00:01:05.460> biology<00:01:06.270> algorithms

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and computational biology algorithms

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.399 
and computational biology algorithms
that<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.369> internally<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:10.110> really

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that that we have internally that really

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
that that we have internally that really
allow<00:01:10.619> us<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.900> essentially

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
allow us to do what we do so essentially

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710 
allow us to do what we do so essentially
we<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.409> three<00:01:14.400> components<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> business

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we have three components in the business

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.030 
we have three components in the business
the<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:17.490> component<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the the first component is a

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.390 
the the first component is a
pharmaceutical<00:01:20.040> related<00:01:22.189> component<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
pharmaceutical related component of the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
pharmaceutical related component of the
business<00:01:23.549> where<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.390> currently<00:01:24.600> have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
business where we we currently have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.320 
business where we we currently have
we've<00:01:25.259> announced<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.680> 10<00:01:26.330> pharmaceutical

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we've announced about 10 pharmaceutical

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.749 
we've announced about 10 pharmaceutical
partnerships<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.610> about

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
partnerships and we actually have about

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.880 
partnerships and we actually have about
thirteen<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.180> fourteen<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.680> these

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
thirteen or fourteen of them now these

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.660 
thirteen or fourteen of them now these
are<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:33.350> arrangements<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.670> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
are our arrangements that are really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
are our arrangements that are really
true<00:01:35.850> partnerships<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> you've<00:01:36.750> probably

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
true partnerships and you've probably

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.410 
true partnerships and you've probably
seen<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> press<00:01:37.590> releases<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.939> they

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
seen the press releases and they they

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
seen the press releases and they they
differ<00:01:39.810> they're<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.409> slightly<00:01:40.799> different

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
differ they're all slightly different

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.580 
differ they're all slightly different
but<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> spirit<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> them<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> same<00:01:43.350> we're

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
but the spirit of them is the same we're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
but the spirit of them is the same we're
essentially<00:01:43.890> taking<00:01:44.270> either<00:01:45.270> retrospective

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
essentially taking either retrospective

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
essentially taking either retrospective
or<00:01:46.470> even<00:01:46.950> prospective<00:01:47.509> clinical<00:01:48.509> trial

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
or even prospective clinical trial

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.100 
or even prospective clinical trial
patients<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.880> we're<00:01:50.880> looking<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.570> their

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
patients and we're looking at their

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.760 
patients and we're looking at their
their<00:01:52.590> tissue<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:54.000> doing<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
their tissue and we're doing a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.899 
their tissue and we're doing a
comprehensive<00:01:55.770> molecular<00:01:55.890> profile<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
comprehensive molecular profile on it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.510 
comprehensive molecular profile on it
and<00:01:57.500> obviously<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.250> many

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and obviously we can go you know many

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800 
and obviously we can go you know many
different<00:01:59.670> directions<00:01:59.939> based<00:02:00.450> upon<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
different directions based upon the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
different directions based upon the
individual<00:02:01.229> partnership<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.070> second

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
individual partnership the second

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.830 
individual partnership the second
component<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> course<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> clinical

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
component of course is the clinical

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.240 
component of course is the clinical
component<00:02:03.960> where<00:02:04.469> I've<00:02:04.649> spent<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> majority

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
component where I've spent the majority

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550 
component where I've spent the majority
of<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.670> career<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.570> clinical<00:02:06.780> diagnostic

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
of my career I'm the clinical diagnostic

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.369 
of my career I'm the clinical diagnostic
side<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> CLIA<00:02:08.340> approved<00:02:09.379> assay

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
side so we have a CLIA approved assay

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.800 
side so we have a CLIA approved assay
called<00:02:10.619> foundation<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.480> actually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
called foundation one that was actually

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.910 
called foundation one that was actually
released<00:02:13.140> formally<00:02:13.770> at

ultimately<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:45.000> talk<00:02:45.269> about<00:02:45.510> molecular

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
ultimately I talk about molecular

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.630 
ultimately I talk about molecular
information<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:46.920> imagine<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
information you can imagine that the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.340 
information you can imagine that the
amount<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.209> content<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> amount<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
amount of content the amount of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.820 
amount of content the amount of
molecular<00:02:49.800> content<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.940> we're<00:02:51.120> finding<00:02:51.830> in

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
molecular content that we're finding in

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.550 
molecular content that we're finding in
in<00:02:53.280> our<00:02:53.400> academic<00:02:53.580> partnerships<00:02:54.569> as<00:02:54.750> well<00:02:55.200> as

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
in our academic partnerships as well as

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.990 
in our academic partnerships as well as
in<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> clinic<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:58.610> really<00:02:59.610> something

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
in in the clinic is really something

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
in in the clinic is really something
that<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.739> building<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:02.040> very<00:03:02.819> powerful

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that is building a very powerful

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.259 
that is building a very powerful
database<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> itself<00:03:06.030> this

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
database and that in and of itself this

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.050 
database and that in and of itself this
content<00:03:06.959> becomes<00:03:07.260> valuable<00:03:08.060> extremely

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
content becomes valuable extremely

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.259 
content becomes valuable extremely
valuable<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:09.720> believe<00:03:09.989> over<00:03:10.799> time<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.459> as<00:03:11.700> we

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
valuable we believe over time and as we

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.330 
valuable we believe over time and as we
you<00:03:12.600> add<00:03:12.810> patients<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.920> add<00:03:14.069> more

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you add patients and you add more

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.500 
you add patients and you add more
information<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:17.280> clearly<00:03:17.610> becomes<00:03:18.090> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
information it it it clearly becomes you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.660 
information it it it clearly becomes you
know<00:03:18.540> clinically<00:03:19.410> useful<00:03:19.620> clinically<00:03:20.400> useful
