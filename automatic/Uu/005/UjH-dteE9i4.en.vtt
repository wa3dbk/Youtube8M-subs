00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.800
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 Battlefield play4free cast and this time 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 is it finally about the m 16 a 2 who 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.560
 this power has been around for so long 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 time and also from so many people 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 wanted that I thought now is one 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.949
 time now I can get out in part 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.260
 So good is only for general 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 weapon is a 3 firearm that is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 you can not shoot fully automatically 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.110
 but one mouse click gives you one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.850
 Salve off with three shots 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 there comes the total of one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 speed of up to 600 shot 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.540
 per minute which is quite neat 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.480
 you have your magazine 25 shot and that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.340
 three times the realtime is at 4 seconds 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 scheduled and thus in the normal range 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.700
 absolutely okay 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.520
 yes, the absolute range you with it 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.129
 can reach 220 meters and thus 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.170
 already a sniper range is good for 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.530
 damage the weapon on close range power 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 the 27 to 29 hurt on medium rangers 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.619
 21 to 25 and on the domestic about 18 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.630
 to 23 years this is very very good though 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.700
 Now we come to my 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.929
 impression of the thing 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 first but still a huge thanks to 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.200
 sniper hero 2 for giving me the game 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.300
 Unfortunately I did not play player because of that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 That's why I'm unable to work with my flowers 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.640
 a big thanks for snap aero two 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 the channel link is in the description 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 Okay , let's get started so the site is there 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.369
 Relatively open, I like it very much 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 the rear is a bit small and narrow 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 but the chaos ensuring a perfect grunde a 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.099
 very nice time of recall 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.840
 completely controllable 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.130
 he hits the top and also one 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.080
 not enough time but that can 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.340
 one with a nemesis or with the steak 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.039
 fix it super 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.380
 so that's not a big topic anymore 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.630
 the rangers would recommend you all the way 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.530
 Clearly all Rangers it's on the short 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 distances a bit in part 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 harder if you are in close combat since you 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.709
 actually always exactly two burst 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.000
 needs to turn off opponents it was 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.310
 because there are hedge funds then needs 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.979
 you only have one burst that is bit 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 Exercise and then it goes on all distances 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.340
 perfect yes I would like to recommend 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.140
 would be in the reason all toilets up to 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.599
 range cards as it is very very 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.580
 big distances speak from 100 to 150 meters 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.650
 yes I would say rather tricky 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.010
 it will just happen someday 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.769
 a point reached where you nothing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.709
 he is good now it goes on 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.900
 with management recommendations in the basics 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.280
 There are two very good options 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 to equip in the 16 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760
 on the one hand, you can get them for the melee 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.310
 and for the offensive play style 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.989
 Equip then I would come or 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.670
 viper max just recommend it 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.470
 Do more harm to the short distances 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 then makes the ball is if the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.310
 namely does not reduce the damage 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.650
 but then improves recall the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.390
 Predator barrel and a rapid in the red dot 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.200
 or maybe that will make it a better one 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.549
 if you are so defensive and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.720
 says i want your fight against that 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.549
 take the second method 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.709
 then recommend car kit max or 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.659
 Sting remakes because you more shot 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.220
 in the magazine has and at the stingray max 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.799
 just a little more harm 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.299
 they are almost as at max then the 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.579
 nemesis stop the reduced though the 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.470
 harm minimal but still gives one 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.030
 better control over the weapon 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.940
 Prussian barrels for more accuracy 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.989
 and even more reach and than if 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.569
 I either use the standards 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.150
 so that with it you can prove it 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.769
 less recoil or of course that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.940
 m word for the five seitz with it 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.739
 has a zoom and a little bit on 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.269
 sniper can do that he two 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.629
 recommendations and now it is up to you 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.530
 as you equip the weapon now give 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.150
 I'll give you a few more tips and tricks 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
 how he could get better with the tri 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.109
 it is always recommended against the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.699
 recoil or less to fight that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.049
 means you just shoot 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.639
 nice against then you have less 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.069
 recoil more accuracy and since 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.720
 best always best on already 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.250
 aiming for the head that naturally does 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.959
 in the hurt and there gets the opponent 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.299
 sure to last with a stock market 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.099
 use little hit fire but just 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.989
 very much more helpful 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.370
 it almost impossible opponents again 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.799
 to get and you have that in the video 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.819
 often seen enough nor the pages 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.129
 as fast as possible behind each other 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.030
 leave if possible without a break then 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.650
 you have the highest fire 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.949
 speed and the best 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.699
 possibility to get the opponents down 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.260
 so and now we come to 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.569
 final question is the am 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.400
 sixteen 29 buy values ​​yes or no 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.590
 the high damage the high accuracy 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.299
 and the low recoil offer great 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.190
 requirements for a perfect 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.479
 allround weapon with a lot of potential 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.039
 That's why I think it's very clear 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.000
 Purchase recommendation because the part already yes 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.260
 off so that twelve unlockable is the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.610
 It was now with the 16 clock 2 comments 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.520
 Now I have a few things 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.630
 to announce namely steffen with the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.370
 from the nazi games 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.290
 a video made that is a hot one 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.730
 chair video he has me very much 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.870
 many super- imaginary questions 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.910
 I'm sure you would be interested 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.070
 So to me to my youtube channel and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.600
 and and therefore I really will

 Please click on it but on the left 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.270
 in the description 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 on the other hand, you still want a youtuber 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.540
 I announce that sooner 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320
 first met and what the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.090
 young marco left to the description and 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.370
 again to the memory so the 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.130
 facebook-page as well as the teamspeak 3 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.150
 server on the band everything still exists 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.970
 what he needs in the description 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.350
 I would be happy to click it again 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.850
 and what will I do now I hope so 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.260
 We liked you then see you in the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.260
