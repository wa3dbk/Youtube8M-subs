00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello everyone welcome to my first 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.700
 video but the first of many 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.000
 a little introduction of what is going to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.620
 do this what I want it to be 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.119
 I want this channel to be 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.930
 just to have a good time and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.400
 so that we do not solve some doubts that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.590
 you have regarding any game or 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.800
 some program or whatever 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.169
 I'm going to upload 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.620
 some videos to explain the program 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.469
 or things that might interest you 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.420
 and also some videos watching me play 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.940
 for what 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.020
 so that you laugh too, not only 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.830
 it's going to be all teaching 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.860
 and I hope that we are not deceived by the truth 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.930
 keep in mind that in my first video and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.340
 that is not very hard with me 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.510
 Well, let's explain a program 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.089
 I guess you probably know him 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.839
 I bring it in its new version word 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.839
 station 9 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.829
 to virtualize 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 the operating system for for example the 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.920
 new windows 8 that will come out within 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.140
 nothing that the betas have left 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.409
 Well, we can prove it here in this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.930
 new version is implemented for 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.020
 can be used perfectly in the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.270
 version 8 because it did not bring it and this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.320
 version has left a few days ago 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.710
 well apart from another improvement 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.140
 wrong 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.940
 most important of the program but what 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.310
 let's see more is that of the euro of 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
 windows 8 and that 's it the options are 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.460
 practically the same do not have much 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.350
 plus 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.600
 and this video we are going to split it in two 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.299
 let's start with the operation 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.909
 of the program and the second 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.850
 let's install windows 8 and let's see 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.280
 the most important options for 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.229
 more or less so that you see what is the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.950
 operating system itself and if you like or 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.420
 not for 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.150
 to be able to use it in the future 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.590
 Well, let's go to it and click on 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.590
 create a new virtual machine 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 click on advanced to see 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.120
 the options although we will not change much 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.370
 this hardware compatibility what 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 we leave the same 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.430
 we look for the image made 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.519
 which it is what we can lower the microsoft 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 it's free since it 's beta and not the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.000
 they still sell so it takes advantage 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.320
 you want to try because now it's free 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.470
 I have it lowered and I choose it and press 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.930
 over next 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.910
 if here for whatever it is not no it does not tell us 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.970
 what kind of windows do we choose it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.210
 we can look there for all 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.610
 windows there 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.090
 well we use windows 8 that 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.800
 we are going to install we press next 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.850
 the virtual machine we can call it as 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.580
 We want to put 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.070
 but I had for example 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.980
 we press next we leave it the same no 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.780
 number the total process here we have to 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.540
 be careful we have to have in 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.010
 count the gigas of ram the megas of ram 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.010
 sorry we have 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.930
 I have very little and I will put 512 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.549
 nothing less 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.270
 something less than half of what 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.880
 let's have I have 2 gb 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.069
 and I'm not going to spend one because it's going to go 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.900
 pretty regular 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.260
 but good and each one if you have four 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.510
 then compose one and a half things and today 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.379
 pretty well it's a matter of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.769
 tests we press next this is the 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.390
 internet that is going to catch it we press the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.460
 next next next 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.890
 since we do not have to see anything here 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.530
 we have to put the number of gigas that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.500
 he wants us to want him to have our 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.450
 hard drive in the virtual machine also 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 It depends a lot on the gigas we have 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.890
 in our computer but comporte 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.200
 a test composed of 15 we are going to put 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.790
 20 best 20 gb click next 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.300
 next and here 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.300
 does not make a 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.370
 a little introduction of what is going to 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.270
 be our operating system inside 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.840
 and the final reader 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.790
 We wait for the tab to open 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
 and that's it, we have it ready for 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.220
 start what we will see in the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.340
 second video 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.180
 Well nothing that I hope so if you have 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.700
 Any doubt comment what is 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.880
 that you put it to me if you like the video 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.450
 the future videos so first point a 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.100
 twist and if you want and nothing that you 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.200
 subscribe 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.200
 and you will see that it will not disappoint us 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.569
 a greeting
