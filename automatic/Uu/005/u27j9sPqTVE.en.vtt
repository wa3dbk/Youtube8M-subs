00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
my previous best with 495 was with five

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.080 
my previous best with 495 was with five
singles<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.019> the<00:00:10.019> week<00:00:10.200> before<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.889> hit<00:00:11.250> 495<00:00:11.730> or

singles and the week before I hit 495 or
five<00:00:12.269> singles<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.840> did<00:00:13.049> 494<00:00:13.799> 10<00:00:14.130> singles<00:00:14.519> so

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
five singles I did 494 10 singles so

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.410 
five singles I did 494 10 singles so
tonight<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.650> improvement<00:00:17.340> regardless<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
tonight was a improvement regardless so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.310 
tonight was a improvement regardless so
I<00:00:18.890> want<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> talk<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.570> having<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.990> killer

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I want to talk about having the killer

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.950 
I want to talk about having the killer
instinct<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.220> deadlifts<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.420> believe<00:00:24.840> that

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
instinct for deadlifts so I believe that

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640 
instinct for deadlifts so I believe that
you<00:00:25.470> either<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.650> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you either have it or you don't and you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.589 
you either have it or you don't and you
need<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.010> flip<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> switch<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.359> you're

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
need to flip the switch when you're

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.139 
need to flip the switch when you're
about<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> heavy<00:00:32.219> Douglas<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
about to do a heavy Douglas because you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
about to do a heavy Douglas because you
really<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> grip<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> bar<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.040> hard<00:00:35.430> as

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
really need to grip the bar as hard as

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
really need to grip the bar as hard as
you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> need<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> really

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you can and you need to really

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
you can and you need to really
concentrate<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.100> form<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.879> case

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
concentrate on your form so in my case

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.380 
concentrate on your form so in my case
it's<00:00:39.480> keeping<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> knees<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:42.149> hips

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it's keeping the knees out and the hips

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.680 
it's keeping the knees out and the hips
low<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.910> maybe<00:00:44.910> people<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> differing

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
low and maybe people have differing

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.619 
low and maybe people have differing
opinions<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> optimal<00:00:48.030> sumo<00:00:48.300> deadlift

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
opinions on what a optimal sumo deadlift

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
opinions on what a optimal sumo deadlift
should<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.890> something<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> I've

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
should be but that's something that I've

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.020 
should be but that's something that I've
concluded<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.870> something<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> need<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
concluded so something that I need is to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.410 
concluded so something that I need is to
have<00:00:54.199> my<00:00:55.199> knees<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.730> knees<00:00:56.910> pushed<00:00:57.239> out

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
have my knees out my knees pushed out

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
have my knees out my knees pushed out
really<00:00:57.690> hard<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:59.129> hips<00:00:59.280> low<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
really hard and the hips low and this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
really hard and the hips low and this
will<00:01:01.020> enable<00:01:01.199> me<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.670> torso<00:01:02.910> more

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
will enable me to get my torso more

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
will enable me to get my torso more
upright<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> longer

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
upright and because I have a longer

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.230 
upright and because I have a longer
torso<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.110> start<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.350> hips<00:01:07.560> higher<00:01:08.240> my

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
torso if I do start my hips higher my

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
torso if I do start my hips higher my
upper<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> general<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
upper back or my back in general has a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.109 
upper back or my back in general has a
tendency<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.189> really<00:01:14.189> round<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.850> that's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
tendency to really round so that's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
tendency to really round so that's
something<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.509> try<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> eliminate<00:01:16.140> every<00:01:17.130> time

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
something I try to eliminate every time

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
something I try to eliminate every time
while<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.090> similar<00:01:18.420> Delta<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
while I'm doing similar Delta and this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710 
while I'm doing similar Delta and this
also<00:01:19.470> contributes<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.460> very<00:01:21.090> slow<00:01:21.360> start

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
also contributes to the very slow start

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
also contributes to the very slow start
for<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> student<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.920> deadlift<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.430> let's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
for the student with deadlift so let's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
for the student with deadlift so let's
observe<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.360> 6th<00:01:24.930> rep<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.979> doing<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.609 

oh<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.540> too<00:01:39.600> bad<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.260> with<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> patient

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
oh so not too bad I was with a patient

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
oh so not too bad I was with a patient
with<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.010> lift<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.940> managed<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> keep<00:01:42.750> my

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with the lift and I managed to keep my

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.120 
with the lift and I managed to keep my
form<00:01:43.250> somewhat<00:01:44.250> good<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> actually

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
form somewhat good and this is actually

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
form somewhat good and this is actually
the<00:01:47.310> final<00:01:47.729> single<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.240> seventh<00:01:48.720> single<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the final single the seventh single I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070 
the final single the seventh single I
didn't<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.460> much<00:01:50.610> because<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.540> right

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
didn't like too much because my right

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.530 
didn't like too much because my right
hand<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.130> loose<00:01:53.400> when<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.420> was

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
hand it got a little loose when I was

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.510 
hand it got a little loose when I was
locking<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.990> out<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:56.220> these<00:01:57.180> two<00:01:58.250> singles<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
locking it out but these two singles I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.499 
locking it out but these two singles I
feel<00:01:59.820> are<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.360> best<00:02:01.050> representation<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:02.509> my

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
feel are the best representation of my

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.990 
feel are the best representation of my
poles<00:02:03.990> tonight<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.830> 495<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.880> eight

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
poles tonight so the 495 for eight

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
poles tonight so the 495 for eight
singles<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.030> last<00:02:09.959> single

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
singles and this one is the last single

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.570 
singles and this one is the last single
I<00:02:11.600> try<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.630> hold<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.100> didn't<00:02:14.340> work<00:02:14.459> out

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I try to hold it but it didn't work out

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
I try to hold it but it didn't work out
too<00:02:14.760> well<00:02:14.959> yes<00:02:15.959> my<00:02:16.200> grip<00:02:16.709> was<00:02:16.860> getting<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
too well yes my grip was getting a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.540 
too well yes my grip was getting a
