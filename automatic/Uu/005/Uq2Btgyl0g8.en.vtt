00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.060
 market you arm with whatever you want 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.620
 we put the good mushrooms that 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.349
 they fall very well here because they give 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.290
 juices to the tortilla and the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.379

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.240
 a little bit there is a better game out 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.610
 you can even bake 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.520
 you can bake it can be put in a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.840
 mold and they are delicious clear that for 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.699
 grow to the cape in now is 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.949

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.110
 he gives everything to everyone at all 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.970
 those that we cook consumption that 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.250
 They have the best products I love 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.810
 go to jackson attentive or not clear that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.639
 yes they are supremely attentive for the most 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.810
 important is that on Tuesdays and 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.030
 Saturdays on Wednesdays and Saturdays 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.620
 sorry are Wednesdays and Saturdays of the 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 harvest then all the people 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.840
 they have a 20 percent discount on 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.460
 everything what are fruits and vegetables and if 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.940
 you are associated with consumption because you have a 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.909
 25 percent is or better said market 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.039

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.949
 discount and apart from that remember that 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.409
 the next month of October then 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.659
 is going to be the draw the next car and 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.349
 the apartment for purchases higher than 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:21.210
 48 thousand pesos so the idea is to mark 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.400
 in consumption because it 's the experience 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.590
 market with social benefit and not 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.500
 only that is not saving everything is 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.000
 completely cool 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:38.360
 and also by car to go home the 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.760
