00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
(Sarcastic)Oh, yeah, how lucky you are~!

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.200
Guy in this story even said that she looks like 'Kyungri'!

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.640
No, she must not resemble her.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.420
(That can't happen.)

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.040
(They all got jealous of the guy in this story..)

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.100
But this guy is really funny!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.180
(He's saying he's not using any dialect in his speech, but the way he wrote in this story indicates that he already has particular accent.)

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.460
(The way Sung Sikyung spoke is a dialect. But he's saying that "I'm not using dialect at all." So it's a contradiction.)

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.840
I guess the guy in this story must be super handsome.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.200
Oh, you think so?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.140
Maybe he's also quite muscular?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.820
Maybe he looks very handsome that a woman who takes after Kyungri took the initiative.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.260
Although the way he speaks sounds quite naive,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.820
but in reality, he would look very handsome and is very muscular.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.720
He's credulous and handsome!

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.320
Wow~~So envious of him!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.880
Oh, yeah! Let's sum this up as a love story of 'Handsome man and Kyungri'.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.300
Since woman is this active, they will be connected in whatever way.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.420
I'm so envious..

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.440
When we have a look on this story..this woman erased up all the possible confusions(If this woman really loves him or not like that..)

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.160
and she colored the road in "totally natural green color"!(He means that she's not making this guy confused at all. And she just directly expressed her interest in him already!)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.520
Like the world of Oz!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.080
What else does he need to worry about in this situation? This is an unanimous green light! In whatever way he proposes to this woman, they'll go out! They'll become a perfect couple!

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.300
There's a person who sleeps well as soon as his/her head is in touch with somewhere!How can that person sleep so well?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.900
I'm so envious of that kind of person!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.400
Right?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.640
I can't sleep like that.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.180
I wake up like about 50 times if I sleep in a new unfamiliar place.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.780
I can only sleep if I'm canned.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.140
If I don't drink, I seldom sleep.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.900
It became inertia. There are so many people who can sleep only when they are drunk or had medicine.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.100
But it's super dangerous if you eat medicine and alcohol together!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.820
That's same as destroying your stomach!

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.520
'Azak': A sound we can hear when we break up a solid thing by biting it.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.840
Have you ever seen yourself when you fell asleep very deeply?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.400
Well, the photos of my sleeping faces are taken so many times in '1 night and 2 days'.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.360
Right, right..

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.740
I recently knew that our sleeping faces look totally different from our usual faces with closed eyes.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.880
Of course not!

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.980
You remember the time I reenacted a sleeping face of Han Hye-jin for fun?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.060
But I knew that I also sleep like that, with a protruded mouth.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.520
Like this?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.680
So I got so shock!

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.440
You slept as if you have Han Hye-jin in you?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Did you do double jaw surgery?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.420
So, what would you do in this case? Any natural suggestions for him to ask her out?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.980
If I were him, I wouldn't try to ponder on making particularly fabulous moments to ask her out.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.780
I'd rather just ask her to go drink a cup of coffee with me as usual.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.380
(What would Dong-yup do in this case?)

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.320
I'll just keep sleeping when I'm staying next to her.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.320
I'll just lean against her shoulders and sleep..don't you think she will already notice that I'm interested in her?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.200
That's too fast though..How can a guy lean against woman's shoulders all of a sudden..

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.020
I think their relationship should speed up!

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.240
What about you, Sikyung?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.560
Just don't get off.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.140
And if she asks you why, just tell her that 'I can't get off because of you.'

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.640
Right!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.680
Or you can ask her, "You don't usually sleep?"

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.180
And she would answer, "Uh, why?"

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.920
Then, you just tell her, "Cuz I want to wake you up at least once."

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.180
I'm sorry..

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.320
That's black history! Awful chat-up!

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.140
They are in good mood now, and that kind of chat-up will ruin everything!

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.400
(He got gloomy all of a sudden.)

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.280
And it's very important to not act in a cool way!

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.140
Like how Heo Ji-woong said.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.440
Don't tell her like..'I've been loving you for a long time..' but rather!

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.640
Propose her honestly although you would be super shy.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040
"I'm not an expert in this kind of area, so I don't know how to propose you.It's kind of shy for me to speak you in this way, but.."

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.440
Then she'll just know what you mean.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.040
(Dong-yup's all ears.)
