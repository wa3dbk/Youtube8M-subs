00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.200 

until<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.770> get<00:04:37.950> there<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.400> then<00:04:38.940> there's

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
until you get there and then there's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.159 
until you get there and then there's
this<00:04:39.360> kind<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:41.520> thing<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.450> push<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
this kind of thing that you push and

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.370 
this kind of thing that you push and
then<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.280> presses<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.300> hair<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.780> it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
then it just presses the hair and it

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.100 
then it just presses the hair and it
curls<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.830> even<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.780> hold

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
slip to the side you know and you

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.820 
slip to the side you know and you
literally<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:42.290> can't<00:06:42.530> tell<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:42.800> difference

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
literally you can't tell the difference

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.010 
literally you can't tell the difference
and<00:06:43.370> one<00:06:43.880> thing<00:06:44.030> I<00:06:44.120> would<00:06:44.210> say<00:06:44.330> those<00:06:44.540> were<00:06:44.750> the

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
and one thing I would say those were the

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.400 
and one thing I would say those were the
first<00:06:45.200> like<00:06:45.770> time<00:06:46.310> I<00:06:46.340> wore<00:06:46.670> it<00:06:46.850> it<00:06:47.360> did<00:06:47.690> look<00:06:47.870> a

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
first like time I wore it it did look a

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.860 
first like time I wore it it did look a
bit<00:06:48.890> synthetic<00:06:49.430> so<00:06:49.640> it<00:06:49.820> looked<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.270> bit<00:06:50.300> like<00:06:50.480> it

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
bit synthetic so it looked a bit like it

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.630 
bit synthetic so it looked a bit like it
looked<00:06:51.050> like<00:06:51.320> hair<00:06:51.740> extensions<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.430> that's

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
looked like hair extensions and that's

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.250 
looked like hair extensions and that's
because<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.060> hair<00:06:53.240> was<00:06:53.390> really<00:06:53.630> fine

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
because the hair was really fine

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.470 
because the hair was really fine
straight<00:06:54.650> out<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:54.890> packet<00:06:55.280> but<00:06:55.490> I<00:06:55.880> think<00:06:56.390> as

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
straight out the packet but I think as

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.390 
straight out the packet but I think as
time<00:06:56.720> goes<00:06:57.020> by<00:06:57.050> the<00:06:57.350> hair<00:06:57.800> starts<00:06:58.130> to<00:06:58.160> look

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
time goes by the hair starts to look

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.730 
time goes by the hair starts to look
more<00:06:58.880> natural<00:06:59.420> because<00:06:59.600> I<00:06:59.810> don't<00:07:00.169> know<00:07:00.290> the

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
more natural because I don't know the

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.010 
more natural because I don't know the
end<00:07:00.919> start<00:07:01.370> looking<00:07:01.700> like<00:07:01.940> much<00:07:02.450> like<00:07:02.720> my

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
end start looking like much like my

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.910 
end start looking like much like my
natural<00:07:03.380> hair<00:07:03.500> anyway

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
natural hair anyway

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.280 
natural hair anyway
and<00:07:04.070> like<00:07:04.310> after<00:07:05.120> a<00:07:05.150> while<00:07:05.390> as<00:07:05.720> a<00:07:05.750> time<00:07:06.020> goes<00:07:06.260> by

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
and like after a while as a time goes by

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.860 
and like after a while as a time goes by
it<00:07:06.770> blends<00:07:07.040> into<00:07:07.250> my<00:07:07.490> hair<00:07:07.730> a<00:07:07.760> lot<00:07:07.910> more<00:07:08.180> so<00:07:08.690> if

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
it blends into my hair a lot more so if
