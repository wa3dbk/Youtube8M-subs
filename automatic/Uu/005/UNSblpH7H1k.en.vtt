00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.889
 chapeau plates against a nice result 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.769
 ajax that must be extremely good for you 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.059
 feeling hey yes of course winning ajax is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.129
 that is nice and let alone with the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.719
 Celebrate a victory so big the margins 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.980
 communion against each other 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 And yes I think it should be satisfied 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.540
 having this win well 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.370
 fought and therefore rightly overcome 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.740
 was called the mini classic tangents 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.110
 classic how does that live with you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.180
 but you can see that yes the weeks to 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.740
 add a bit of tension and sound 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.390
 cameras are just slightly kids like normal 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 but yes if you see before your match 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 to break apart 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.640
 boost each other and yes you see through 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 that you help each other in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.329
 contest 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.530
 which resulted in that it consists 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.699
 you also showed you to be able to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 go with the net he disappointed the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.890
 first half 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 do you fall behind but me 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 you do not love her through the pits 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.659
 no yes, I think we ever looked 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.260
 only stronger for makking the 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.149
 contest 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.129
 You can see that we are short to the one 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 hope to be right in making it and again 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.370
 that you see that then I could have willpower 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.170
 to be able to do with those who are alone 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 I a fat and that's why the keeper 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 maybe a bit like that, yes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 then just come someone is or 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.680
 itself had a hard time and I think there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.479
 a good miss because in the second 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.130
 half to that red card 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 yes where you simply stronger because of that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 team was actually waiting for that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
 lead exactly where you get to slots 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.210
 time also we inherited green 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 trees from the tour high pace this 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 player of that much longer say more 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.649
 had to make meters 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 yes then you can't go 90 minutes for 45 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.619
 minutes for that and that this for 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.420
 the dry weather is three goals in the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.219
 second day so more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 unlike last season 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.370
 now public by law they are 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.770
 when you were then in that empty tub 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.180
 last season against ajax yes i would 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.710
 say an army you were also unique 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
 yes then said that was well filled though 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.580
 yes it is of course yes on own farc and 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.900
 it is only just beautiful it lives 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.010
 yet something else because it seems 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.450
 all just want something to sit 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.210
 yes then you also feel it a bit 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.890
 Burning from the inside yes so work 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.090
 be sure to know what you notice also at 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.780
 those people by the side through this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.300
 match is alive 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.160
 know for sure that the people who sometimes seemed 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.810
 just ruben out among people and then at 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.130
 U.S 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.720
 well they did have you a bit 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.110
 they started falling known and with the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.070
 a1 now seems to be going a bit better 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.590
 where should this season be for you 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.910
 end yes I think two years as 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.740
 we continue to play that way was me 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.700
 can compete in the top three and that 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.640
 we thereby sure to go 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 championship certainly the first battle 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 go to competitors have also fallen 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 inflicted precisely and gladly to call 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.050
 that we that only the the competitors 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.050
 want to inflict
