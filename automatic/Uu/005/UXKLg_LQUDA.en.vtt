00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 after these things went through jesus 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.230
 the sea of ​​Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 followed a large crowd because he had 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.780
 seen signs that he did in curing the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:57.460
 sick then jesus uploaded downloads and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.750
 accepted there with his disciples is 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.480
 cool, this is not it? 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.850
 We have ours all Friday 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.130
 You can call us to put the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.920
 his name then went up the hill and sat down 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 his disciples were there 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 at Passover the feast of the Jews was 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.750
 next 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.660
 Jesus is gay in the eye and seeing 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.590
 crowd that comes to him told the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.450
 felipe de sá felipe where we will count loaves 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.940
 to give of food will say this to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.410
 try because he knew what 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.770
 he would answer, and I said to him, 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:48.970
 there would be only two hundred denarii 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:51.399
 bread to receive each piece one of the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.729
 his disciples called Andrew brother of 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.610
 simão pedro informed is in a boy 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 which has five barley loaves and two 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.539
 little fishes 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
 but this what is for this great 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.360
 crowd 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.090
 Look, there's a boy there who has five 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.569
 neighboring countries 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.150
 Look, God can multiply your life. 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.940
 multiply your luck his blessing to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.900
 your income 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.930
 God can multiply God could have 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.020
 made nothing at all but he has one 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 principle was these breads 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.150
 these little animals what was so much a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.200
 crowd for these breads wines this 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.870
 fish 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.170
 god is the god of the multiplication of 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.650
 prosperity 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.400
 so a boy with five loaves and two 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.250
 fish perhaps not to this right 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.020
 jesus them do the people accept it 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.500
 there was a lot of grass in that place, 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.140
 a graminha accept if the feet used 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.550
 young people were accepted as the number 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.730
 of 5 thousand 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.180
 then Jesus took the 5,000 men by taking 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.800
 women and children 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 that is, there were many people following the 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.460
 lord jesus 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 then Jesus took the loaves having given 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.780
 thanks distributed between them and also 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.750
 to the fish as much as he wanted and 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.060
 when facts were already theirs 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.450
 disciples collect the pieces that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.900
 left over so nothing compares to what 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.910
 nothing is lost and so they did and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.010
 they filled twelve baskets of pieces in the loaves 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.760
 closed and left over I think there was 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.280
 The men then ate the sign that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.280
 jesus did they said is this is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.489
 truly a prophet who was to come 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.489
 to the world 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.140
 looks well knowing afterwards that Jesus was 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.900
 knowing for Jesus that they were for 2011 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.930
 and institute rescue it for himself 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.830
 I retired and retired again alone to 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.370
 the mountains 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:18.570
 again the mountains then we count 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.269
 which multiplication five loaves and two 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.890
 fish was not a crowd 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.290
 so big 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.699
 sometimes you look, says pastor, I do not have 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.050
 anything 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.070
 but if you look from god and have some 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.660
 thing 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 and this is a thing of God can 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 multiply and prosperity that 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.650
