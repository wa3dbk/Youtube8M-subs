00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 good night let me introduce myself 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.899
 I'm mister grenadine 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.190
 mister granadino 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 see this guys two cars that are there 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.160
 parked pass a grenade 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.650
 obviously all thunder burst and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.390
 explode to the screams and those of the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 Police is normal because no glass 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 that approaching a grenade there is 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 look for her inside the car and it collided so 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.519
 we have to move away we have to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 get away now we're going to die that 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.019
 is that is one of those good explosions 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 that generate chaos I do not know why it 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.379
 they scare so much really alone is it a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.080
 explosion of a grenade that just 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.220
 fly your car and maybe have to pay 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.670
 the insurance that is expensive but driving 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.670
 a plane 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.309
 and speaking of small planes we have to 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.750
 throw the grenades at this plane for 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.030
 that they see when it arrives now is a 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 If you understand me, why not? 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.670
 of explosion plus small plane 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 what happens when you have grenades and a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.850
 parking lot full of cars 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.140
 exploits everything although I do not know why it is 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.070
 powerful truck and maybe it's because 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.649
 really mister 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.759
 the police boys alive 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.960
 what is getting my blood going 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.960
 brain we are driving 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 gas tanks because we are 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.450
 completely mentalized we buy 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.909
 respite we shoot are the second and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.960
 now 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.979
 is the other one and if that is the sound that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.250
 like to listen and now the final act of 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.250
 act 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.479
 well indeed as / is nothing more but 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 so to give intensity to this now 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.970
 we are running down the titan 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.759
 we launched a dynamite and now we launch 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.060
 the second dynamite let's go here we throw 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.250
 the third explosive bomb to 10 and manu 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.080
 record as they are called but good up 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.450
 the fourth can not be placed more than 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.010
 five I put more in a wing but that I think 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.780
 that will not influence the final result 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.060
 now we are going to run so that the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.260
 pieces are not motorcycles although there 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.400
 Now it 's one of those moments when 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.830
 you feel ready to do something and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.250
 you have to do it 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.250
 we start with the countdown 3 2 1 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.190
 with your children, a lot of desire to drive 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.190
 I'm more 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.180
 Now I'm fine
