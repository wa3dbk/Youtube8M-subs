00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.250
 mora red nothing else let's see how to export dt materials tested koala from 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.049
 who presented the program that you use 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.019
 p 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.929
 this is the battery of the vital product 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.679
 and praised we know how to export fight but we have not just on the track of the 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.900
 battery so that it does not export the battery in the registry mentos 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.730
 we put padel sport milingo file export mili 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.429
 pro is the man we want to be but for now we fight 6 ko to steal 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 now we open the program we can use in this case to use the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.990
 nineth 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.470
 we put create a new project 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.950
 percent import mini 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.620
 we ask that you do not create another new project 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.850
 we give them the file that we have created 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.460
 and there we have it for example is the voice to the play because it does not sound anything because the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.610
 mivi encino the sound is just a way to send information 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.530
 then we load the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 the appetite a sativa fire and 6 us instruments 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.260
 hirai we put tight we charge cyprus euros and we want to create a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.190
 api stat some thing but not because we're really going to do it in another way 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 and then in the selection of the track we do not have our extraction and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.860
 distracted from putting a stop 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.500
 the departure of miguel we put pandit and prunus 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.090
 then it is already associated as we see this is not the battery that we only have 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.780
 which option was to adjust the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 the rome 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.159
 all not only of the map mc we put gm 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.090
 there is that it was done but not as gm hites there will be chairs a battery but as 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 view more slowly because the tempo of the project is not the same as the tempo 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.790
 from the file thousand and that had before 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 the third 190 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 and this default to these 120 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.250
 today it will be slower 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.730
 they all form was up to the first 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.250
 we change that there are posters and we put 190 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.050
 youtube and the speed is the one that played 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.909
 let's see it now 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:17.889
 you can this one yes that's the speed it was before it's pretty much faster 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.119
 accused was another way but for most cases it is more correct 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.789
 because not what is said but sales does not leave us the time or 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.549
 anytime 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.889
 who want the same then we start 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.099
 we leave it to present 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.459
 and go by control mas t to be at 30 we can adjust the time that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.919
 so change in such a compass that you change the 190 dove that we want 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.139
 t 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.149
 but I hope you have always liked it, they are not worth gold 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.749
 a 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.450
 as
