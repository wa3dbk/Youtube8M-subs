00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
just gonna want to build an enclosed

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.990 
just gonna want to build an enclosed
area<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.380> animals<00:00:30.769> cannot<00:00:31.220> move<00:00:31.609> or

area so that the animals cannot move or

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.990 
area so that the animals cannot move or
get<00:00:32.390> out<00:00:32.449> in<00:00:32.839> any<00:00:33.080> kind<00:00:33.350> of<00:00:33.410> way<00:00:33.589> and<00:00:34.000> I'm

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
get out in any kind of way and I'm

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.570 
get out in any kind of way and I'm
trying<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.360> make<00:00:35.510> use<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.620> smaller<00:00:36.949> d-pad

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
trying to make use the smaller d-pad

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.939 
trying to make use the smaller d-pad
that<00:00:38.390> way<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.660> all<00:00:39.019> can<00:00:39.050> see<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.530> screen<00:00:39.800> a

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
that way you all can see the screen a

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.100 
that way you all can see the screen a
little<00:00:40.040> better<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:41.449> really<00:00:41.720> hard<00:00:41.900> for<00:00:41.960> me

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
little better it's really hard for me

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.110 
little better it's really hard for me
because<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:42.500> have<00:00:42.739> big<00:00:42.950> hands<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.610> um<00:00:43.760> I'm

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
because I have big hands but um I'm

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.880 
because I have big hands but um I'm
gonna<00:00:44.239> try<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.480> anyway<00:00:44.600> hopefully<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:45.590> looks<00:00:45.710> a

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
gonna try it anyway hopefully it looks a

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.220 
gonna try it anyway hopefully it looks a
whole<00:00:46.010> lot<00:00:46.070> better<00:00:46.219> for<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.539> my<00:00:47.750> movement

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
whole lot better for you but my movement

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.139 
whole lot better for you but my movement
will<00:00:48.379> probably<00:00:48.680> be<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.800> whole<00:00:48.980> lot<00:00:49.010> slower<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
will probably be a whole lot slower so

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.130 
will probably be a whole lot slower so
you're<00:00:50.480> going<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.660> want<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:50.899> build<00:00:51.079> something

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
you're going to want to build something

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.680 
you're going to want to build something
just<00:00:51.739> like<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.149> it<00:00:53.149> doesn't<00:00:53.180> have<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:53.660> be

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
just like that it doesn't have to be

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.299 
just like that it doesn't have to be
enclosed<00:00:54.110> on<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.469> sides<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:54.949> I'm<00:00:55.070> just

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
enclosed on the sides but I'm just

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.950 
enclosed on the sides but I'm just
making<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:55.670> really<00:00:55.699> small<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.600> video

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
making it really small for this video

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.529 
making it really small for this video
then<00:00:57.680> just<00:00:57.949> place<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.820> animal<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.329> your

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
then just place the animal of your

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.830 
then just place the animal of your
choice<00:00:59.570> inside<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.879> little<00:01:02.149> area<00:01:02.539> and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
choice inside of the little area and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.560 
choice inside of the little area and
that<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.050> exactly<00:01:03.440> why<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.820> should<00:01:05.030> build<00:01:05.239> two

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
that is exactly why you should build two

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.419 
that is exactly why you should build two
up<00:01:05.840> which<00:01:06.229> I'm<00:01:06.440> going<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:09.440> really

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
up which I'm going to do now I really

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.340 
up which I'm going to do now I really
need<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.729> turn<00:01:10.880> on<00:01:11.060> split<00:01:11.450> touch<00:01:11.660> too<00:01:11.960> because

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
need to turn on split touch too because

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.770 
need to turn on split touch too because
I'm<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.860> haven't<00:01:13.670> been<00:01:13.759> using<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:14.390> i<00:01:14.479> really

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
I'm I haven't been using it but i really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.490 
I'm I haven't been using it but i really
like<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.330> just<00:01:17.570> spawn<00:01:17.930> your<00:01:18.140> animal

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
like it on so you just spawn your animal

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.730 
like it on so you just spawn your animal
inside<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> area<00:01:19.880> place<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> minecart<00:01:21.320> and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
inside of the area place a minecart and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.569 
inside of the area place a minecart and
they<00:01:22.640> will<00:01:22.850> start<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.270> walk<00:01:23.630> around<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.579> it

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
they will start to walk around and it

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.789 
they will start to walk around and it
will<00:01:25.729> eventually<00:01:25.970> run<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.290> as<00:01:27.590> you

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
will eventually run into it and as you

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.960 
will eventually run into it and as you
can<00:01:27.979> see<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.990> pig<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.259> now<00:01:30.590> riding<00:01:30.979> inside<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
can see the pig is now riding inside of

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.539 
can see the pig is now riding inside of
the<00:01:32.090> minecart<00:01:32.630> some<00:01:33.290> do<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.680> one<00:01:34.070> more<00:01:34.310> time

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
the minecart some do this one more time

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.550 
the minecart some do this one more time
with<00:01:34.880> another<00:01:35.000> animal<00:01:35.659> just<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.990> prove<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> you

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
with another animal just to prove to you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.670 
with another animal just to prove to you
it<00:01:36.770> works<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:38.509> st.<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.899> editing<00:01:39.290> trick<00:01:39.560> or

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
it works the st. and editing trick or

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.050 
it works the st. and editing trick or
anything<00:01:40.040> heck<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.430> don't<00:01:40.490> even<00:01:40.640> know<00:01:40.880> how<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
anything heck I don't even know how to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.260 
anything heck I don't even know how to
edit<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.450> good<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.470> um<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.490> spilled<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.119> in

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
edit that good so um you spilled you in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.010 
edit that good so um you spilled you in
a<00:01:44.360> enclosed<00:01:45.079> area<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:47.360> should<00:01:47.509> probably<00:01:47.720> do

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
a enclosed area you should probably do

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.460 
a enclosed area you should probably do
it<00:01:48.049> two<00:01:48.439> blocks<00:01:48.470> high<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.240> no<00:01:50.540> animals<00:01:51.020> can<00:01:51.259> get

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
it two blocks high so no animals can get

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.749 
it two blocks high so no animals can get
out<00:01:53.350> tell<00:01:54.350> me<00:01:54.500> what<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.770> think<00:01:54.799> about<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
out tell me what you think about the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.880 
out tell me what you think about the
smaller<00:01:56.119> d-pad<00:01:56.689> does<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.140> make<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.320> see<00:01:57.680> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
smaller d-pad does it make you see the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.300 
smaller d-pad does it make you see the
screen<00:01:58.250> better<00:01:59.200> it<00:02:00.200> probably<00:02:00.560> does<00:02:00.740> because<00:02:01.070> I

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
screen better it probably does because I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.370 
screen better it probably does because I
know<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.490> had<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.759> pretty<00:02:02.030> big<00:02:02.270> before<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.290> you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
know I had it pretty big before so you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.950 
know I had it pretty big before so you
just<00:02:03.409> build<00:02:03.829> something<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:04.909> this<00:02:04.969> put

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
just build something just like this put

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.800
