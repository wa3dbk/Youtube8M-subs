fly-fishing<00:00:18.060> schools<00:00:18.449> today<00:00:19.080> we're<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
fly-fishing schools today we're going to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
fly-fishing schools today we're going to
talk<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.670> bad<00:00:20.880> cast<00:00:21.180> making<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.690> good

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
talk about that bad cast making a good

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.439 
talk about that bad cast making a good
bad<00:00:22.140> cast<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.010> tell<00:00:23.520> folks<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> time<00:00:24.000> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
bad cast I tell folks all the time I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.490 
bad cast I tell folks all the time I
think<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> back<00:00:24.900> cast<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
think the back cast that's the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320 
think the back cast that's the
foundation<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.520> cast<00:00:26.850> we<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
foundation for a good cast we want to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.700 
foundation for a good cast we want to
make<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.170> nice<00:00:28.439> loop

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
make sure that we get that nice loop

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
make sure that we get that nice loop
rolling<00:00:29.100> out<00:00:29.189> behind<00:00:29.520> us<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.150> makes<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
rolling out behind us that makes that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
rolling out behind us that makes that
forecast<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.320> much<00:00:31.590> easier<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
forecast so much easier so I'm going to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
forecast so much easier so I'm going to
talk<00:00:33.030> about<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.329> couple<00:00:33.570> different<00:00:33.960> types<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
talk about a couple different types of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.799 
talk about a couple different types of
back<00:00:34.530> cast<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> high<00:00:36.570> angle

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
back cast we can make be at a high angle

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
back cast we can make be at a high angle
back<00:00:37.110> cast<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.250> cast<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.730> straight

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
back cast or a back cast going straight

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
back cast or a back cast going straight
back<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.079> back<00:00:40.290> cast<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> be

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
back and the one back cast we want to be

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.860 
back and the one back cast we want to be
a<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.460> wary<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.690> one

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a little bit wary of and that's one

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.069 
a little bit wary of and that's one
that's<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> dipping<00:00:43.559> down<00:00:44.840> also<00:00:45.840> I'm

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that's kind of dipping down also I'm

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
that's kind of dipping down also I'm
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> talk<00:00:46.469> about<00:00:46.500> making<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> curve<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
going to talk about making a curve on

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.940 
going to talk about making a curve on
your<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.030> cast<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.320> also<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
your back cast that that can also be a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.610 
your back cast that that can also be a
little<00:00:50.340> detrimental<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.390> nice<00:00:51.660> loop<00:00:51.989> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
little detrimental to that nice loop on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
little detrimental to that nice loop on
the<00:00:52.800> forward<00:00:53.129> cast<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.329> casting

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the forward cast so when we're casting

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
the forward cast so when we're casting
we<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:55.710> sure<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.039> make<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> smooth

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
we want to make sure we make that smooth

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
we want to make sure we make that smooth
acceleration<00:00:57.410> if<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> rod<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
acceleration if I take this rod and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
acceleration if I take this rod and
watch<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.180> next<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.660> cast<00:01:00.960> I'm<00:01:01.170> about

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
watch on this next back cast I'm about

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.860 
watch on this next back cast I'm about
to<00:01:01.800> make<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.000> run<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.719> get

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to make if I take this run and don't get

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.139 
to make if I take this run and don't get
a<00:01:03.930> smooth<00:01:04.289> acceleration<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.459> just<00:01:05.909> make<00:01:06.060> an

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
a smooth acceleration and just make an

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.120 
a smooth acceleration and just make an
aggressive<00:01:06.389> flick<00:01:06.869> notice<00:01:07.469> how<00:01:07.649> that<00:01:07.709> line

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
aggressive flick notice how that line

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.069 
aggressive flick notice how that line
got<00:01:08.340> directed<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.209> here<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.749> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.899> show

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
got directed down here I'm going to show

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:10.730 
got directed down here I'm going to show
you<00:01:10.109> that<00:01:10.350> again

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you that again

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.849 
you that again
so<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.279> I<00:01:11.369> pick<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> rod<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.209> one<00:01:12.420> speed

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
so if I pick the rod up at one speed

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.559 
so if I pick the rod up at one speed
aggressive<00:01:13.859> flick<00:01:14.130> notice<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.060> loop<00:01:15.359> is

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:15.569 
aggressive flick notice that loop is

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.359 
aggressive flick notice that loop is
going<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.899> little<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.139> downhill<00:01:16.499> that's<00:01:17.069> not<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
going a little bit downhill that's not a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.669 
going a little bit downhill that's not a
very<00:01:17.789> good<00:01:17.969> back<00:01:18.240> cast<00:01:18.539> I'm<00:01:19.170> having<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
very good back cast I'm having a

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.649 
very good back cast I'm having a
building<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.999> slack<00:01:21.359> in<00:01:21.569> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
building actually a lot of slack in that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
building actually a lot of slack in that
cast<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.499> all<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.740> slack<00:01:23.009> makes<00:01:23.310> me<00:01:23.459> have<00:01:23.579> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
cast and all that slack makes me have to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
cast and all that slack makes me have to
work<00:01:23.789> even<00:01:23.969> harder<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.959> that<00:01:25.079> line<00:01:25.289> out<00:01:25.499> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
work even harder to get that line out in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.739 
work even harder to get that line out in
front<00:01:25.889> of<00:01:26.009> me<00:01:26.099> so<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.969> want<00:01:27.209> to<00:01:27.299> try<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.539> do

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
front of me so what I want to try to do

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.319 
front of me so what I want to try to do
is<00:01:27.929> make<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.259> nice<00:01:28.499> smooth<00:01:28.979> acceleration<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
is make a nice smooth acceleration to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
is make a nice smooth acceleration to
that<00:01:30.479> stop<00:01:30.779> that's<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.319> to<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.529> that<00:01:31.679> loop

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that stop that's going to get that loop

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.699 
that stop that's going to get that loop
to<00:01:32.369> roll<00:01:32.789> out<00:01:32.999> much<00:01:33.240> nicer<00:01:33.689> behind<00:01:34.079> me<00:01:34.319> that

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
to roll out much nicer behind me that

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.159 
to roll out much nicer behind me that
smooth<00:01:35.130> acceleration<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.329> stop<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.169 
smooth acceleration to that stop that

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.019 
smooth acceleration to that stop that
gets<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> line<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.979> accelerate<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
gets that line out accelerate to that

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.319 
gets that line out accelerate to that
stop<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:40.039> accelerate<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.340> stop<00:01:41.639> now

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
stop and accelerate to that stop now

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
stop and accelerate to that stop now
right<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:42.959> making<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> bad<00:01:43.439> cast

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
right there I'm making a bad cast

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.949 
right there I'm making a bad cast
relatively<00:01:44.459> straight<00:01:44.819> back<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.359> in<00:01:45.719> some

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
relatively straight back and in some

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.779 
relatively straight back and in some
situations<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:47.069> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> work<00:01:47.459> great

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
situations that's going to work great

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.879 
situations that's going to work great
let's<00:01:48.119> say<00:01:48.270> we're<00:01:48.419> on<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.539> salt<00:01:48.869> flat<00:01:49.169> or<00:01:49.649> let's

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
let's say we're on a salt flat or let's

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.010 
let's say we're on a salt flat or let's
say<00:01:50.069> we're<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.489> open<00:01:50.969> trout<00:01:51.450> fishing<00:01:51.659> area

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
say we're in a open trout fishing area

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.779 
say we're in a open trout fishing area
but<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.499> some<00:01:52.739> situations<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.429> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.639> make<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
but in some situations I have to make a

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.550 
but in some situations I have to make a
high-back<00:01:54.329> cast<00:01:54.719> let's<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:54.959> we're<00:01:55.109> fishing<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
high-back cast let's say we're fishing a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.919 
high-back cast let's say we're fishing a
very<00:01:56.130> brushy<00:01:56.429> stream<00:01:56.819> or<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.239> got<00:01:57.419> a<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
very brushy stream or it's got a lot of

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.769 
very brushy stream or it's got a lot of
high<00:01:58.169> high<00:01:58.859> banks<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> in<00:02:00.059> that<00:02:00.209> case<00:02:00.419> I<00:02:00.630> want

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
high high banks and in that case I want

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.120 
high high banks and in that case I want
to<00:02:00.809> make<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> acceleration<00:02:01.559> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.009> bit

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to make that acceleration a little bit

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
to make that acceleration a little bit
sooner<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.999> try<00:02:03.209> to<00:02:03.270> send<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.809> line<00:02:03.989> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
sooner and try to send that line a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.559 
sooner and try to send that line a
little<00:02:04.169> bit<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.590> uphill<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.429> now<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.059> get<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
little bit more uphill so now I get that

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.809 
little bit more uphill so now I get that
loop<00:02:06.779> rolling<00:02:07.380> uphill<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
loop rolling uphill this is going to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.240 
loop rolling uphill this is going to
help<00:02:09.030> me<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.689> that<00:02:09.869> line<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.349> over<00:02:10.649> something

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
help me get that line up over something

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
help me get that line up over something
behind<00:02:11.519> me<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.140> we're<00:02:13.319> making<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
behind me now when we're making this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.540 
behind me now when we're making this
back

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
back

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.010 
back
okay<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.940> also<00:02:16.090> want<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> make<00:02:16.570> sure<00:02:16.600> that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
okay we also want to make sure that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.360 
okay we also want to make sure that
we're<00:02:17.170> tracking<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.830> nice<00:02:18.010> straight<00:02:18.340> line

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
we're tracking in a nice straight line

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.550 
we're tracking in a nice straight line
so<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.120> I'm<00:02:19.270> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> cast<00:02:19.750> at<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.020> camera

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so now I'm going to cast at the camera

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.710 
so now I'm going to cast at the camera
and<00:02:21.430> I'm<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> show<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.000> something<00:02:22.600> that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and I'm going to show you something that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780 
and I'm going to show you something that
I<00:02:22.750> see<00:02:23.050> quite<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.410> few<00:02:23.500> people<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.220> when<00:02:24.640> we're

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
I see quite a few people do when we're

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.300 
I see quite a few people do when we're
casting<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:25.870> cast<00:02:26.140> ideally<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.100> want

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
casting when we cast ideally we want

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.790 
casting when we cast ideally we want
that<00:02:27.430> loop<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.850> top<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.560> say

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
that loop on top you know I like to say

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.100 
that loop on top you know I like to say
stacked<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.400> top<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.820> itself<00:02:31.120> behind<00:02:31.570> us<00:02:31.870> and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
stacked on top of itself behind us and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.660 
stacked on top of itself behind us and
that's<00:02:32.560> going<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.740> help<00:02:32.890> give<00:02:33.100> us<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.460> nice

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's going to help give us that nice

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's going to help give us that nice
accurate<00:02:34.000> forward<00:02:34.750> cast<00:02:34.990> when<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.740> stacked

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
accurate forward cast when it's stacked

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.740 
accurate forward cast when it's stacked
on<00:02:36.190> top<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.790> get<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.060> line<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.420> roll

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
on top we can get that line to roll

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.590 
on top we can get that line to roll
right<00:02:38.140> out<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:39.190> come<00:02:39.430> right<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.670> target<00:02:40.150> I've

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
right out and come right on target I've

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.810 
right out and come right on target I've
seen<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.050> lot<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> anglers<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.160> this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
seen a lot of anglers do this

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.430 
seen a lot of anglers do this
some<00:02:43.180> even<00:02:43.450> very<00:02:43.630> good<00:02:43.690> anglers<00:02:44.200> have<00:02:44.380> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
some even very good anglers have a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.140 
some even very good anglers have a
slight<00:02:44.800> tendency<00:02:44.830> when<00:02:45.490> they<00:02:45.640> make<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.820> back

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
slight tendency when they make that back

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.880 
slight tendency when they make that back
cast<00:02:46.450> rather<00:02:46.990> than<00:02:47.200> getting<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.470> loop<00:02:47.710> on

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
cast rather than getting that loop on

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.130 
cast rather than getting that loop on
top<00:02:48.070> they<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.910> slight<00:02:49.180> tendency<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.810> bring

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
top they have a slight tendency to bring

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680 
top they have a slight tendency to bring
it<00:02:50.290> around<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.770> side<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.660> little

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it around to the side that's a little

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.170 
it around to the side that's a little
twist<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.190> see<00:02:54.430> right<00:02:54.640> there<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
twist you can see right there and that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.210 
twist you can see right there and that
deviation<00:02:55.960> from<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.230> straight<00:02:56.710> path<00:02:56.920> is

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
deviation from that straight path is

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.650 
deviation from that straight path is
going<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.430> make<00:02:57.580> me<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> work<00:02:58.060> harder<00:02:58.630> on

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
going to make me have to work harder on

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.050 
going to make me have to work harder on
that<00:02:58.900> forecast<00:02:59.470> so<00:03:00.190> what<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.730> envision

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
that forecast so what I like to envision

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
that forecast so what I like to envision
it's<00:03:01.690> almost<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.050> I'm<00:03:02.170> pulling<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.800> rod

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
it's almost like I'm pulling that rod

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.890 
it's almost like I'm pulling that rod
straight<00:03:03.460> back<00:03:03.700> I'm<00:03:03.910> coming<00:03:04.210> straight<00:03:04.390> back

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
straight back I'm coming straight back

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.290 
straight back I'm coming straight back
to<00:03:05.590> try<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.160> line<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.490> stack<00:03:07.000> right

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
to try and get that line to stack right

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.020 
to try and get that line to stack right

on top of itself on that back cast right
there<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.960> going<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.170> help<00:03:11.380> me<00:03:11.500> get<00:03:11.860> a

there that's going to help me get a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680 
there that's going to help me get a
little<00:03:11.950> bit<00:03:12.220> more<00:03:12.370> accuracy<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.420> even

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
little bit more accuracy and it's even

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.320 
little bit more accuracy and it's even
going<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> help<00:03:14.020> with<00:03:14.230> some<00:03:14.380> distance

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
going to help with some distance

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.090 
going to help with some distance
straight<00:03:16.330> back<00:03:16.600> then<00:03:17.020> straight<00:03:17.380> forward<00:03:17.770> with

straight back then straight forward with
