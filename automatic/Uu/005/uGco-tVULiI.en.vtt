00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
details right now it's gonna be a lot
similar<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.290> pass<00:01:04.739> game's<00:01:05.100> gonna<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> lot

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

simpler<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> Final<00:01:06.720> Fantasy<00:01:06.840> 15<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.830> yeah<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
simpler to Final Fantasy 15 so yeah and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
simpler to Final Fantasy 15 so yeah and

happen in early 2014 no way in hell

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.800 
happen in early 2014 no way in hell
that's<00:01:48.689> gonna<00:01:49.020> happen<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.810> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that's gonna happen there because it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
that's gonna happen there because it
just<00:01:52.229> announced<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.280> development

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.310 
and I think they would say it would be
released<00:01:58.020> early<00:01:58.229> 2014<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:01.259> were

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
released early 2014 if if they were

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.420
