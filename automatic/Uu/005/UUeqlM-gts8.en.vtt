00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.849
 Hello dear friends this is us bull 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:22.250
 and now i'm in the toilet cinema 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:25.880
 because I just came in a session 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.710
 telekinesis if you watch the movie 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.230
 with novelties in general you watch it or 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.790
 just want to go to the cinema then you 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.559
 direct road there for this movie i 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.770
 just impressed by this 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.470
 film as for the film then the action 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.940
 unfold in some state 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.199
 small into consideration the girl who 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.269
 zadripannaya which is notorious 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.059
 there were some problems mother hysterical 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:54.260
 by the way is a spoiler now so if you 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.440
 I will not argue much just tell 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.379
 superficially and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.009
 map mother hysterical quite descended 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.810
 crazy and the girl finds in herself some 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.310
 the ability of so-called telekinesis is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.350
 Tilkin abilities and name-based 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.320
 actually attributed to this 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.690
 telekinesis abilities one girl here 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.509
 this development of ability and in one 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.229
 beautiful moment when she crumbles 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.830
 almost all when it turns out for her 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.580
 everything 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.470
 and absolutely laugh at him 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.840
 classmates at school despise and she 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.840
 applies these abilities well and everybody 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.939
 It becomes kirdyk therefore I advise 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 go to this movie i will put 10 of 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.540
 10 saw this film at the end is not so 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 Kinolyapa then of course I can 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.460
 tell you how you are not yet because 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.230
 that this is a spoiler on here however the film has become 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.150
 good special effects at the highest level 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.220
 just incredible 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.310
 and if that he and mascara does not apply to 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.260
 the movie we have a cinema 30 minutes was 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.050
 advertising imagine that is here we are 30 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.120
 minutes sat and waited this one when 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.460
 will be advertising 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 do i bought two barrels meekly and myself 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.960
 I already planted one and a half packs on advertising 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.470
 i.e. not quite comfortable i think that 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.120
 advertising must be shown 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 if from this room already sat down for a long time 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.230
 and first session for five minutes 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.390
 delayed that I didn't like it later 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 another 30 showed ads were not easier 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.680
 advertisements already include while everyone sits down well 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.050
 of course help or money is all 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.459
 I understand that there are no questions here but 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 This I did not like him not to 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.410
 It concerns more questions to the very 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 cinema and be sure to go to this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.720
 I liked the movie very much I was 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.830
 in the evening a very cool setting is good 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.470
 matched actors 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.769
 these cute all nice play well 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.100
 Before them, too, in the toilet, people bar closed 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.019
 here already with what 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.150
 I hope you do not smell like me now 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.100
 okay it was all telekinesis it would have 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.380
 us goal it was a review on the movie u like 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.940
 review is just my opinion i advise it 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.440
 go to a cool movie 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.080
 have not seen such people for a long time therefore go and not 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.180
 feel sorry for the money awesome movie and not 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.300
 wait for him on the computer because in 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.830
 cinema watching is completely different 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.890
 for me rather than sitting at home on 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.000
 the sofa and the quality will not come soon 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.100
 probably that's why everyone thanks
