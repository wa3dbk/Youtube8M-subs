00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 because I know that if you allow me to intend 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.600

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.080
 ideas 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.280
 I'm sorry but I detest the rain 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.280
 a phobic 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.770
 well I justified the rain 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.020
 please give me another chance 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.490

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.080
 have Mr. manager to present 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.919
 this is supposed to be an agency of 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.889
 professional advertising has a building 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.080
 great 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.659
 the 'rais' should be in this 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.719
 moment writhing in his full tomb 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.449
 of worms and things of the dead if 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:10.630
 he is dead 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.160
 we're 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.940
 we should give it a second 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.569
 opportunity 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.760
 considers 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:23.890
 I just why do you say it 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.890
 Mexico is a country that I love 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.840
 this power there could the center 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.360
 historical and can go to the pyramids or 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.540
 equal to judge by his shirt I think that 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.540
 would love to go to the countess eye to the 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.100
 pink area 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.330

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.370
 get some rest 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 disgusting 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:44.250
 that it was all something unexpected and now 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.250
