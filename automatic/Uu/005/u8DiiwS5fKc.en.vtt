 amy culinary hello and thank you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.690
 to join me for a new 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.220
 recipe 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.580
 welcome to those who are just coming 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 to arrive 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 but in any case we are going to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.630
 continued started with a recipe 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.970
 winter that says winter says soup has everything 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 right away they say or can say 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 is that there is and me when I was 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.109
 little during the winter I had a lot of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.849
 soup a little too much for my taste and I 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.949
 had come to dislike the cargo hold of the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.250
 everything especially to those based on apples 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.090
 earthen 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.160
 well, I'll know why I was not 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 maybe not very gourmet sdage 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 knowing that when I was little I 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.770
 far exceeded in junk food 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.739
 but where close to 13 years old joke us 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.050
 let's start with soup and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 it's all flat could see very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 quickly is simple fast without apples 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.550
 earthenware without leek without cooking 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.039
 but if you want it you can 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 always let the soup turn in the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.030
 blender for a while and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 eva then cool or even heated so 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 it's just your choice so if 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.710
 you want to stay hollow stay in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.799
 below 38 degrees Celsius 42 of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.820
 bruges I was responding to sugar so 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.460
 as usual I trust you 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.590
 and I show you art so it's 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 good appetite, we're off to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
 this recipe 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.630
 we will use two cut carrots 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.430
 roughly up to a charlotte but 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 it can be a michalak up to a 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 half clove garlic admitted avocado for this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 keep the rest for the end of ginger 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.780
 and fresh turmeric in small quantities 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 will only remain to hit with a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.590
 spoon of the cream a third of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 cup of fresh carrot juice 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.159
 pressed a cup and a half from the east of the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.259
 China 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.600
 or else coconut milk for more 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.030
 see the description of the juice 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 of lemon one of your favorite spices 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 here I'm using smoked paprika 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.860
 finally add a little salt put all 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:28.930
 the solid ingredients first in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:39.820
 the bowl of the blender pour your ingredients 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:41.410
 liquids in 2d and full of this soup 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.440
 can be enjoyed hot or cold 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.300
 as I said previously let the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 blender more or less long activated 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.680
 so that the blades of the blender warms up 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 the cargo hold 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.460
 be careful not to overheat the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.350
 soup over 38 degrees celsius 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.710
 we begin to lose the qualities 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.750
 Bunker Nutrients for your 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.820

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.350

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.570
 spices and black pepper if it's not 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.550
 at these tracks and now we have 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.209
 finished our under now will not stay 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.860

 very creamy and that's its reach by the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.260
 coconut milk that I put my you 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.910
