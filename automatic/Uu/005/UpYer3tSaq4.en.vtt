00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.120
 who was cola and I would replace going for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 the second time but try not to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.179
 too critical and please 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 because I see at the big theater 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.389
 it's very pleasant what you write 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.410
 on me but when you say 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.450
 m and myself van hamme 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.670
 I think it's never fun 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.700
 because the end of the year is still there 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.830

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.640
 then counted proof we did not 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.400
 always have time to make videos 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.960
 here you go again second small point 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.040
 for the one who follow me on my channel 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 who saw that I had hair 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.830
 rossellat and that made me really stupid 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 you asked why 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.699
 I read your paintings common there is more 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.510
 nothing i'm going to talk about on my 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.700
 chain without ridicule 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.950
 short the question the week were 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.190
 calm what to do is beach and theme 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.430
 to talk about one of the tubes etc 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.239
 so I like my monoi masters who 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
 center to the second 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 then even to serve any metal and 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.420
 feel the show wisely well 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.530
 magazines she of course have the donuts 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.780
 latest 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 I watched my 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 for those who say I do not know 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.359
 talk pages describes a soft compromise 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.159
 done since when we were not voting so in 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.330
 reading we have others besides quality 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.480
 this chain another officer 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.840
 who is totally an almost loving fan 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.790

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.640

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.750
 sort out 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.750

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 it's a bit of his adventures I'm mac 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.160
 scoundrel who motivated me that beginning 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.649
 I admit that I was inspired but 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.350
 finally as we go to lens 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.400
 weird 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.370
 in front of his camera and that's it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.080
