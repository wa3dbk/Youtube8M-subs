 met the written 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.940
 production output of Mrs. Schavan for 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.479
 invalidate her and give her the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 to withdraw the doctoral degree 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.610
 I now explain in individual 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.649
 the faculty council of the philosophical 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.360
 faculty has in today's meeting 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.970

 plagiarism allegations against a woman professor 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 Doctor Annette Schavan continued 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.300
 Basis of the consultations were the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.259
 preliminary report of the promotion committee 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.410
 as well as those of the affected 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.310
 submitted comments to the also 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.310
 two of the appended ones 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.880
 educational science 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.209
 Opinions include this material 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 in the past two weeks the 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.959
 members of the faculty council 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.020
 was accessible and became of them 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.869
 thoroughly tested 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.899
 the faculty council has this material for 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.670
 adequate to his advice 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.580
 continue today and one today 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.739
 to reach a decision 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.319
 the question whether deviating from 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.800
 comparable plagiarism 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.250
 examination procedure on others 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.770
 faculties an additional external one 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.790
 well 8 is necessary was from 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.840
 faculty council negates in the of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 attached comments 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.129
 becomes a special feature 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 educational science promotion 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.989
 sculpture in the early 80s 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.849
 believed to be the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.709
 legal representation of Mrs Schavan 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.980
 profession in how far this but special features 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.810
 when quoting could from the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.730
 faculty council can not be understood 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.209
 self-critical states that though 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.090
 faculty that in its history 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.329
 always in individual areas or 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.860
 deficits in the individual 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.370
 care and in the examination of 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.140
 may have given dissertations 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.840
 nevertheless, there is no doubt about it 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.000
 to note that the citation standards 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.459
 of educational science 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.129
 time of origin of the work 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.819
 same as those in the rest 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.069
 philosophical faculty in 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.459
 relevant guides and 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.560
 Handouts were made clear 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.799
 that unmarked literal 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.220
 Take over of foreign texts as text 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.350
 plagiarisms are to be valued and sanctions 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.310
 if they have to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.540
 get discovered 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.940
 from that understanding of plagiarism as 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.060
 unmarked and thereby theirs 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.430
 leading takeover of foreign texts could 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.260
 Therefore, the faculty council at the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.169
 assessment of written promotion 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.049
 performance of woman schavan go out without 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.239
 the danger is a backprojection of today 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.980
 standards in those times too 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.130
 succumb 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.010
 the faculty council declined for this 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.590
 special dissertation of a plagiarism 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.099
 to apply the understanding of the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.040
 general also at the beginning of the 1980s 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.250
 years valid opinion differs 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.660
 This also seemed to him against the background 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.849
 Relevant experiences from the 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.250
 Everyday academic exam 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.500
 operation is not responsible 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.630
 can 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 the faculty council has looked after this 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.789
 basic explanation in his 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.039
 consultations after thorough examination and 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.280
 discussion 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.290
 finally the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.540
 valuation of the promotion committee to 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.240
 made that in the dissertation 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.700
 by Mrs Schavan to a significant extent 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.210
 unmarked literal 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.810
 takeover of foreign texts are to be found 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.630
 the frequency and construction of this 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.330
 literally they did not take over 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.860
 mention of literature titles in 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.860
 footnotes or even im 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 list of literature gives the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.660
 Conviction of the faculty council love that 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.540
 the whole picture that the then doctoral student 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.960
 systematically and deliberately over the 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.930
 distributed throughout the dissertation 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 mental achievements pretended to be in 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.800
 reality had not provided itself 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.280
 The responses of Mrs. Schavan 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.500
 could not invalidate this image 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.300
 therefore, the faculty council has done 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.770
 a deliberate deception by 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.830
 plagiarism found 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.660
 That decision was yes at 13 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:47.710
 agree with 2 contents like 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.530
 then the faculty council has all 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.900
 arguments thoroughly appreciated 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.970
 to cite the benefit of those concerned 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:00.400
 In particular, this includes the 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.729
 long time distance since the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.940
 preparation of the work has elapsed 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.970
 as well as the fact that the affected 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.750
 besides her promotion about none 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.780
 has other degrees 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.250
 on the other hand, in particular 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.940
 hold 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.090
 the quality as well as the scope of 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.010
 found plagiarism and the 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.990
 public interest in the protection of 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.860
 honesty scientific 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.940
 qualification purchase down 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.130
 Dutiful exercise of his by the 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.530
 awarding the doctoral degree 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:45.400
 the faculty council has twelve 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.460
 yes-agree to 29 votes in one 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.440
 abstention in secret vote 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.020
 finally decided 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.360
 the written promotion achievement of 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.460
 to declare woman schavan invalid 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.440
 and to deprive her of the doctoral degree 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.540
 in the following days I will as 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.720
 Dean the reasons for the decision 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.900
 summarize the faculty council and the 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.070
 can provide affected 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.640
 against this decision can be within 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.490
 of four weeks to be brought suit 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:20.030
 the philosophical faculty is ready 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.550
 their next days and weeks 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.470
 make the decision transparent 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.050
 if not reasons of 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.350
 personal protection of the affected 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.130
 to speak up against 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.090
 thank you very much my ladies and gentlemen 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.090
