something<00:04:28.930> yeah<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:31.030> don't<00:04:32.030> really<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.270> i<00:04:32.479> do

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
something yeah I don't really think i do

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.060 
something yeah I don't really think i do
that<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.810> i<00:04:32.990> had<00:04:33.139> any<00:04:33.229> action<00:04:33.590> figures<00:04:33.889> i<00:04:34.039> I

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
that if i had any action figures i I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.370 
that if i had any action figures i I
wouldn't<00:04:34.550> go<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.669> far<00:04:34.849> but<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:36.050> know<00:04:36.229> just

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
wouldn't go that far but you know just

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.700 
wouldn't go that far but you know just
the<00:04:36.830> idea<00:04:37.039> that

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the idea that

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.320 
the idea that
just<00:04:38.950> probably<00:04:39.220> something<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.910> would<00:04:40.090> do<00:04:42.330> this

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
just probably something I would do this

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.920 
just probably something I would do this
is<00:04:43.420> all<00:04:43.540> theoretical<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:45.490> know<00:04:46.440> DBZ<00:04:47.440> such<00:04:48.930> yes

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
is all theoretical you know DBZ such yes

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.610 
is all theoretical you know DBZ such yes
so<00:04:53.640> do<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.730> live<00:04:54.880> action<00:04:55.150> figures<00:04:55.480> well<00:04:56.230> that's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
so do I live action figures well that's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.410 
so do I live action figures well that's
you<00:04:57.190> know<00:04:57.310> it's<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.490> sign<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:57.790> it's<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.300> to

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
you know it's a sign that it's going to

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.990 
you know it's a sign that it's going to
be<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.630> big<00:04:59.170> thing<00:04:59.200> because<00:04:59.980> usually<00:05:00.580> for

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
be a big thing because usually for

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.550 
be a big thing because usually for
movies<00:05:01.330> they<00:05:01.510> don't<00:05:01.720> make<00:05:01.840> action<00:05:02.230> figures

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
movies they don't make action figures

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.800 
movies they don't make action figures
unless<00:05:03.930> they<00:05:05.430> explain<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.820> I'm<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.480> explain

unless they explain and I'm not explain

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.160 
unless they explain and I'm not explain
the<00:05:07.960> expected<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.800> big<00:05:09.780> now<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.840> got<00:05:11.140> the
