to do about registry cleaners which one
is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> best<00:00:09.840> how<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.740> compare<00:00:11.070> these<00:00:11.280> two

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
is the best how do I compare these two

cleaners<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.279> historically<00:00:24.050> good<00:00:25.050> tools<00:00:25.460> but

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
cleaners are historically good tools but

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
cleaners are historically good tools but
they<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.390> dangerous<00:00:27.630> tools<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.439> used

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
they can also be dangerous tools if used

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
they can also be dangerous tools if used
improperly<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.990> any

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
improperly and not and you don't do any

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.139 
improperly and not and you don't do any
kind<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.500> backing<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.940> are

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
kind of backing up now there are

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.490 
kind of backing up now there are
advantages<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.809> come<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.380> you're

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
advantages that come when you're

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
advantages that come when you're
actually<00:00:34.680> using<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.309> registry<00:00:35.730> cleaner<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually using a registry cleaner it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
actually using a registry cleaner it
will<00:00:36.690> remove<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> junk<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:37.980> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
will remove a lot of the junk out of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
will remove a lot of the junk out of
your<00:00:38.190> registry<00:00:38.550> which<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.149> overtime

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
your registry which is good for overtime

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
your registry which is good for overtime
because<00:00:40.260> it'll<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.739> also<00:00:41.040> improve<00:00:41.489> your

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
because it'll actually also improve your

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
because it'll actually also improve your
user<00:00:41.879> experience<00:00:42.540> by<00:00:43.079> removing<00:00:43.469> old<00:00:43.620> file

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
user experience by removing old file

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.000 
user experience by removing old file
associations<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> things<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.010> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
associations and things like that that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
associations and things like that that
being<00:00:47.309> said<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.149> problem<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> idea

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
being said the problem with the idea

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.200 
being said the problem with the idea
behind<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.770> registry<00:00:50.280> cleaner<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> logic

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
behind a registry cleaner the logic

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
behind a registry cleaner the logic
behind<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.600> registry<00:00:51.989> cleaner<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
behind a registry cleaner is that it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
behind a registry cleaner is that it's
scanning<00:00:53.460> over<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:53.910> system<00:00:54.360> registry<00:00:54.539> which

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
scanning over your system registry which

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
scanning over your system registry which
is<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.440> backbone<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:56.610> entire

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
is like the backbone of your entire

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.740 
is like the backbone of your entire
computer<00:00:57.300> system<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.340> it's<00:00:59.750> automatically

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
computer system and it's automatically

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
computer system and it's automatically
detecting<00:01:01.469> errors<00:01:01.680> okay<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.699> sounds<00:01:03.180> great

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
detecting errors okay so it sounds great

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.859 
detecting errors okay so it sounds great
in<00:01:03.960> theory<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.150> automatically<00:01:06.150> detecting

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
in theory but automatically detecting

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.510 
in theory but automatically detecting
errors<00:01:07.080> remember<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> based<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> an

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
errors remember this is based on an

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.340 
errors remember this is based on an
algorithm<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.540> came<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
algorithm that they came up with that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
algorithm that they came up with that
applies<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> majority<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.610> machines<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
applies to the majority of machines so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
applies to the majority of machines so
there<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.439> chance<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:15.570> registry

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
there is the off chance that a registry

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
there is the off chance that a registry
cleaner<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.400> remove

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cleaner can go in there and remove

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
cleaner can go in there and remove
something<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.360> supposed<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> remove<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
something it's not supposed to remove I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
something it's not supposed to remove I
want<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> understand<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> severity

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
want you to understand that the severity

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
want you to understand that the severity
of<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> consequences<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.830> can

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of that can the consequences of that can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
of that can the consequences of that can
be<00:01:23.460> extremely<00:01:23.939> frustrating<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.080> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
be extremely frustrating so if you're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.399 
be extremely frustrating so if you're
using<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.790> any<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> registry<00:01:27.659> cleaner<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
using a any kind of registry cleaner you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.170 
using a any kind of registry cleaner you
have<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.979> make<00:01:29.130> sure<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> backup

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
have to make sure to use the backup

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
have to make sure to use the backup
utility<00:01:30.540> within<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.320> registry<00:01:31.829> cleaner

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
utility within that registry cleaner

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.480 
utility within that registry cleaner
before<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.570> actually<00:01:33.840> run<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> clean<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
before you actually run the clean if you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.660 
before you actually run the clean if you
do<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.600> risking<00:01:37.670> removing

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
do not do this you are risking removing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.280 
do not do this you are risking removing
an<00:01:38.759> invalid<00:01:39.119> entry<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.659> causing<00:01:39.990> system

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
an invalid entry and causing system

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
an invalid entry and causing system
instability<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
instability so I have to get that out of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
instability so I have to get that out of
the<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> people<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.020> aware<00:01:43.049> of

the way a lot of people are not aware of

you which one is better because in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.750 
you which one is better because in
reality<00:02:40.019> they<00:02:40.739> both<00:02:40.920> come<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> exact

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
reality they both come to do the exact

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.699 
reality they both come to do the exact
same<00:02:41.790> thing<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.349> going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.650> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
same thing if I was going to have to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.350 
same thing if I was going to have to
pick<00:02:43.860> between<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.310> two<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> would<00:02:44.730> actually<00:02:45.060> up

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
pick between the two I would actually up

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.199 
pick between the two I would actually up
for<00:02:45.390> glary<00:02:45.810> utilities<00:02:46.099> mostly<00:02:47.099> because<00:02:47.730> glary

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
for glary utilities mostly because glary

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.000

and<00:03:14.519> they<00:03:15.000> remove<00:03:15.360> all<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:15.720> files<00:03:15.900> from

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and they remove all those files from

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.020 
and they remove all those files from
your<00:03:16.200> registry<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> theory<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.819> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
your registry and in the theory is it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.970 
your registry and in the theory is it
not<00:03:18.269> only<00:03:18.390> reduces<00:03:18.959> your<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.500> disk<00:03:19.769> usage

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
not only reduces your your disk usage

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.309 
not only reduces your your disk usage
which<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> minuscule<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> idea<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
which is minuscule but the idea is it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.100 
which is minuscule but the idea is it
also<00:03:22.560> improves<00:03:22.800> your<00:03:22.950> disk<00:03:23.190> access<00:03:23.700> time<00:03:24.110> for

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
also improves your disk access time for

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.500 
also improves your disk access time for
registry<00:03:25.680> entries<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.909> if<00:03:27.299> you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
registry entries as well so if you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.420 
registry entries as well so if you
accumulated<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.349> lot<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.620> junk<00:03:28.890> over<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.190> long

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
accumulated a lot of junk over a long

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.000 
accumulated a lot of junk over a long
period<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.849> time<00:03:29.909> it<00:03:30.629> can<00:03:30.780> also<00:03:31.110> free<00:03:31.709> up<00:03:31.830> some

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
period of time it can also free up some

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.800 
period of time it can also free up some
projects<00:03:32.849> that's<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.629> it<00:03:33.720> can

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
projects that's time for that but it can

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.210 
projects that's time for that but it can
also<00:03:33.900> allow<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:36.349> when<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:37.470> can<00:03:37.620> it'll

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
also allow you to when you can it'll

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.949 
also allow you to when you can it'll
also<00:03:38.370> remove<00:03:38.760> those<00:03:38.970> file<00:03:39.209> associations<00:03:39.870> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
also remove those file associations so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.960 
also remove those file associations so
you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> better<00:03:40.379> user<00:03:40.890> experience<00:03:41.099> if

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
you can have a better user experience if

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.670 
you can have a better user experience if
you<00:03:42.180> run<00:03:42.330> into<00:03:42.390> those<00:03:42.690> file<00:03:42.900> extensions<00:03:43.440> again

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
you run into those file extensions again

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.619 
you run into those file extensions again
so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.459> mean<00:03:44.700> there's<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.909> lot<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.150> things<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
so I mean there's a lot of things that

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.899 
so I mean there's a lot of things that
you<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.159> reality<00:03:47.310> I

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
you can do with it but but in reality I

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.539 
you can do with it but but in reality I
getting<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.200> comparison<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.920> comparison

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
getting in the comparison to comparison

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.280 
getting in the comparison to comparison
to<00:03:50.640> comparison<00:03:51.269> part<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.690> mean<00:03:52.049> they<00:03:52.140> all

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
to comparison part I mean they all

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.170 
to comparison part I mean they all
pretty<00:03:52.590> much<00:03:52.799> do<00:03:53.189> the<00:03:53.220> same<00:03:53.549> thing<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.000> got<00:03:54.150> to

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
pretty much do the same thing you got to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210 
pretty much do the same thing you got to
