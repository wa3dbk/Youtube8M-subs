where he's moving sideways also a lot of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.630 
where he's moving sideways also a lot of
times<00:00:28.870> when<00:00:29.020> we're<00:00:29.140> moving<00:00:29.289> laterally<00:00:29.860> we're

times when we're moving laterally we're

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.329 
times when we're moving laterally we're
not<00:00:30.760> able<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:32.289> not<00:00:32.379> able<00:00:32.499> to<00:00:32.649> move<00:00:32.949> into

not able to we're not able to move into
the<00:00:33.550> court<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.059> attack<00:00:34.449> right<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:35.620> if<00:00:35.679> a<00:00:35.739> ball

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
the court and attack right so if a ball

the court and attack right so if a ball
is<00:00:35.980> hit<00:00:36.190> deep<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:36.730> we're<00:00:36.999> moved<00:00:37.179> to<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.420> side

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
is hit deep and we're moved to the side

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.549 
is hit deep and we're moved to the side
then<00:00:39.850> with<00:00:40.089> the<00:00:40.210> lateral<00:00:40.719> footwork<00:00:41.170> pattern

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
then with the lateral footwork pattern

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.930 
then with the lateral footwork pattern
you'll<00:00:41.679> notice<00:00:41.920> Kyle<00:00:42.159> will<00:00:42.370> be<00:00:42.489> using<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.909> lot

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
you'll notice Kyle will be using a lot

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.020 
you'll notice Kyle will be using a lot
of<00:00:43.149> a<00:00:43.600> open<00:00:44.260> stance<00:00:44.739> may<00:00:45.159> be<00:00:45.219> a<00:00:45.309> square<00:00:45.640> stance

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
of a open stance may be a square stance

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.719 
of a open stance may be a square stance
if<00:00:46.359> it's<00:00:46.539> a<00:00:46.600> shorter<00:00:46.929> ball<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:50.550> every<00:00:51.550> ball

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
if it's a shorter ball and every ball

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.040 
if it's a shorter ball and every ball
has<00:00:51.909> to<00:00:52.089> be<00:00:52.179> hit<00:00:52.300> cross-court<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:52.899> he's

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
has to be hit cross-court so he's

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.770 
has to be hit cross-court so he's
hitting<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.319> percentage<00:00:53.769> shot<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:55.510> having<00:00:55.690> to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
hitting a percentage shot not having to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.279 
hitting a percentage shot not having to
recover<00:00:56.139> as<00:00:56.379> much<00:00:56.909> in<00:00:57.909> a<00:00:58.059> real-time<00:00:58.299> situation

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
recover as much in a real-time situation

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.520 
recover as much in a real-time situation
and<00:01:00.479> playing<00:01:01.479> with<00:01:01.569> good<00:01:01.749> margin<00:01:02.199> over<00:01:02.289> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and playing with good margin over the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.570 
and playing with good margin over the
net<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.879> gives<00:01:04.210> him<00:01:04.570> good<00:01:05.410> depth<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.400> let<00:01:06.520> me

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
net which gives him good depth so let me

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.630 
net which gives him good depth so let me
play<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.000> video<00:01:07.300> in<00:01:07.600> in<00:01:08.590> real<00:01:08.920> time<00:01:14.640> every

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
play the video in in real time every

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.010 
play the video in in real time every
ball<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.030> cross-court<00:01:16.570> so<00:01:16.750> here's<00:01:16.960> a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
ball is a cross-court so here's a

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.040 
ball is a cross-court so here's a
cross-court<00:01:17.770> forehand<00:01:18.010> he<00:01:18.790> recovers<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:19.840> an

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
cross-court forehand he recovers then an

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:38.980 
cross-court forehand he recovers then an
inside-out<00:01:20.620> forehand

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.840 

now<00:01:39.079> let's<00:01:39.860> just<00:01:40.009> kind<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.189> look<00:01:40.400> at<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
now let's just kind of look at the the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.420 
now let's just kind of look at the the
footwork<00:01:41.780> patter<00:01:42.020> notice<00:01:42.470> how<00:01:42.649> he's<00:01:43.250> moving

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
footwork patter notice how he's moving

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:53.499 
footwork patter notice how he's moving
laterally<00:01:50.290> also<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.670> more<00:01:52.909> efficient

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
laterally also to to be more efficient

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.490 
laterally also to to be more efficient
not<00:01:54.110> having<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.700> know<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:57.200> take<00:01:57.350> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
not having to you know to take that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.039 
not having to you know to take that
extra<00:01:57.740> step<00:01:58.000> notice<00:01:59.000> how<00:01:59.149> Kyle<00:01:59.420> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> videos

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
extra step notice how Kyle in the videos

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.499 
extra step notice how Kyle in the videos
using<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:00.530> lot<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.860> open<00:02:01.280> stance<00:02:04.149> he's<00:02:05.149> finding

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
using a lot of open stance he's finding

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.990 
using a lot of open stance he's finding
the<00:02:05.630> ball<00:02:05.780> out<00:02:05.960> in<00:02:06.140> front<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.729> then<00:02:07.729> he's

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the ball out in front and then he's

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.229 
the ball out in front and then he's
really<00:02:08.330> ripping<00:02:08.539> up<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.019> across<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.349> ball

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
really ripping up and across the ball

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.100 
really ripping up and across the ball
you<00:02:11.239> can't<00:02:11.510> see<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.780> here<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.230> he's<00:02:14.110> using

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you can't see it here but he's using

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:27.410 
you can't see it here but he's using
almost<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.850> semi-open<00:02:16.850> square<00:02:17.330> stance

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.540 

now<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.870> drill<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.290> well<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:30.100> want

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
now with this drill as well I want

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.449 
now with this drill as well I want
wanted<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.360> mindful<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.410> i'm<00:02:32.920> using<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
wanted to be mindful that i'm using a

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.520 
wanted to be mindful that i'm using a
bounce<00:02:33.790> feed<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> feed<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.110> ball<00:02:35.290> I'm

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
bounce feed so when I feed the ball I'm

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.199 
bounce feed so when I feed the ball I'm
letting<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.890> bounced<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.490> then<00:02:36.819> hitting<00:02:37.120> it

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
letting it bounced and then hitting it

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.490 
letting it bounced and then hitting it
rather<00:02:37.450> than<00:02:37.600> out<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.990> air<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:38.350> just

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
rather than out of the air so I'm just

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.480 
rather than out of the air so I'm just
trying<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> make<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.890> drill<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> little<00:02:39.280> bit

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
trying to make the drill a little bit

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.670 
trying to make the drill a little bit
more<00:02:39.610> realistic<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.810> other<00:02:40.959> thing<00:02:41.170> too<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:41.410> if

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
more realistic the other thing too is if

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.650 
more realistic the other thing too is if
you<00:02:41.800> want<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.130> really<00:02:42.310> move<00:02:42.580> them<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.540> know

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
you want to really move them you know

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.809 
you want to really move them you know
you<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.930> probably<00:02:44.140> feed<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> ball<00:02:44.739> deeper<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
you can probably feed the ball deeper to
