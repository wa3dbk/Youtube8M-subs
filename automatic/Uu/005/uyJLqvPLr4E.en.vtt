big<00:00:45.910> polymer<00:00:46.510> clay<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.200> i<00:00:47.830> used<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
big polymer clay and i used the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.970 
big polymer clay and i used the
fluorescent<00:00:49.090> red<00:00:49.450> here<00:00:49.930> which<00:00:50.440> has<00:00:50.770> already

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
fluorescent red here which has already

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.180 
fluorescent red here which has already
been<00:00:51.190> fired<00:00:51.720> so<00:00:52.720> i'm<00:00:53.260> just<00:00:53.560> using<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.890> sponge

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
been fired so i'm just using a sponge

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.300 
been fired so i'm just using a sponge
brush<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:55.090> I'm<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.560> kind<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:56.920> literally

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
brush and I'm going to kind of literally

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.690 
brush and I'm going to kind of literally
paint<00:00:57.760> these<00:00:58.000> beads<00:00:58.360> on<00:00:58.600> here<00:00:59.080> and<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.670> is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
paint these beads on here and it is

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.810 
paint these beads on here and it is
transparent<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.840> it's<00:01:02.400> it<00:01:03.400> gives<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.790> a

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
transparent so it's it gives you a

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.120 
transparent so it's it gives you a
totally<00:01:04.360> different<00:01:04.719> look<00:01:04.929> than<00:01:05.199> anything

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
totally different look than anything

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.490 
totally different look than anything
else<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.579> used<00:01:07.000> but<00:01:07.570> yet<00:01:07.750> leave<00:01:07.960> these<00:01:08.200> beads

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
else you used but yet leave these beads

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.090 
else you used but yet leave these beads
that<00:01:08.799> make<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> really<00:01:10.119> cool<00:01:10.619> texture<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.829> your

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
clay so you want to paint this on really

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.770 
clay so you want to paint this on really
thick<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:18.369> if<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.549> do<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.909> cine<00:01:19.179> really

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
thick because if you do to cine really

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.260 
thick because if you do to cine really
the<00:01:19.899> beads<00:01:20.109> kind<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.560> tend<00:01:20.829> to<00:01:20.920> fall<00:01:21.130> off<00:01:21.399> so

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
the beads kind of tend to fall off so

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.370 
the beads kind of tend to fall off so
i'm<00:01:22.329> not<00:01:22.450> going<00:01:22.630> around<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.020> edges<00:01:23.170> or

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
glass beads already dry now you have to

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.629 
glass beads already dry now you have to
wait<00:01:44.020> until<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.439> dries<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.249> one<00:01:45.429> way

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
you'll know it's dry is it will turn a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.629 
you'll know it's dry is it will turn a
clear<00:01:48.850> color<00:01:49.119> when<00:01:49.899> it's<00:01:50.079> wet<00:01:50.289> it's<00:01:50.530> white<00:01:50.829> so

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
clear color when it's wet it's white so

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:52.950 
clear color when it's wet it's white so
you<00:01:51.999> always<00:01:52.119> want<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.359> make<00:01:52.450> sure<00:01:52.509> it's<00:01:52.780> dry
