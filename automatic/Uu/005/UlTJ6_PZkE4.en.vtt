00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
copper steel as see these all look will

explain<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.129> steel<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.430> outside<00:03:02.760> but

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
explain the steel from outside but

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.640 
explain the steel from outside but
that's<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.150> insulation<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.170> clad<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.530> the

that's just insulation and clad in the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.490 
that's just insulation and clad in the
interiors<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.340> all<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:05.879> copper<00:03:06.169> so<00:03:07.169> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
interiors is all is all copper so the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.220 
interiors is all is all copper so the
the<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.730> vaporized<00:03:09.359> spirit<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.109> bounce

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the the vaporized spirit will bounce

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.710 
the the vaporized spirit will bounce
around<00:03:10.439> react<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.609> copper<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.419> you<00:03:12.599> get

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
around react with the copper and you get

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.149 
around react with the copper and you get
the<00:03:12.780> formation<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.260> esters<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.919> that's

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
the formation of esters and that's

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.429 
the formation of esters and that's
what's<00:03:14.430> given<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.180> kind<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.419> fruity<00:03:15.989> slightly

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
what's given the kind of fruity slightly

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.869 
what's given the kind of fruity slightly
fruity<00:03:16.650> character<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.370> you'll<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.669> from

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
fruity character that you'll get from

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.970 
fruity character that you'll get from
perhaps<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.659> absolutely<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.379> now<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:19.829> going

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
perhaps so absolutely so now we're going

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.149 
perhaps so absolutely so now we're going
to<00:03:20.099> take<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> deep<00:03:20.730> look<00:03:20.879> into<00:03:21.629> how<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.620> produce

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
to take a deep look into how to produce

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.899 
to take a deep look into how to produce
a<00:03:23.730> world-class<00:03:24.200> bucket<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.560> absolutely<00:03:26.430> we

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
a world-class bucket like absolutely we

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.789 
a world-class bucket like absolutely we
start<00:03:27.269> with<00:03:27.540> adding<00:03:28.079> wheat<00:03:28.730> yeast<00:03:30.500> water<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
start with adding wheat yeast water and

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.589 
start with adding wheat yeast water and
enzymes<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.000> start<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.419> fermentation

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599

it<00:03:36.449> would<00:03:36.629> form<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.019> number<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:38.010> other<00:03:38.190> or

it would form a number of other or

different chemical components but we

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.140 
different chemical components but we
don't<00:03:40.440> want<00:03:40.680> them<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:40.979> define<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.340> bottle<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.060> a

going to get rid of everything except
the<00:03:46.530> ethanol<00:03:46.889> we<00:03:47.159> start<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:47.970> type<00:03:48.269> of

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
the ethanol we start with this type of

distillation and the next step is the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
component that we

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
component that we
smell<00:04:32.160> them<00:04:32.310> taste<00:04:32.490> Buddha<00:04:33.030> there<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.419> we've

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
smell them taste Buddha there so we've

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.600 
smell them taste Buddha there so we've
pre-mixed<00:04:34.080> martinis<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:34.980> different

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
pre-mixed martinis for different

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.070 
pre-mixed martinis for different
Booker's<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.120> same<00:04:36.300> Volkers<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.870> are<00:04:36.960> in

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.620 
that we've Mo's the Booker's in there
straight<00:04:41.190> substrate<00:04:41.910> form<00:04:42.120> then<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.450> will

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
straight substrate form then I will

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.780 
straight substrate form then I will

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that is going to be most expressive once

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.000 
that is going to be most expressive once
you<00:04:57.660> know<00:04:57.720> it's<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.930> very<00:04:58.080> minimally<00:04:58.590> next

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
you know it's a very minimally next

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.560 
you know it's a very minimally next
thing<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.400> can<00:04:59.520> actually<00:04:59.639> you<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.210> recognize

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
still it is definitely there and biggest

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.620
