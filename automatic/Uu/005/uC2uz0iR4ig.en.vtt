 but not diminish the performance 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.550

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.369
 Gladbach 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.509
 Let's have a look at the scorers 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.720
 lasogga is currently with six goals 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.750
 together with captain van der vaart 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.480
 best shooter at hamburger sv 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.440
 behind it maxi has 3 carlo with it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.410
 two as well as leave with a gate 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 at gladbach is currently the best 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
 Sagittarius 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.440
 max kruse with 5 together with raphael 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.989
 He will share this rank behind senior 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 with three of them after a few 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.250
 Change media reports in winter 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.830
 Should it be otherwise barany jutta 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.739
 and Patrick Herrmann with two 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.660
 tors 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.769
 a whopping 80 percent of the lots from 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.090
 hamburger sv with at least three goals 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.799
 to draw the same balance for gladbach 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.330
 gladbach currently in fourth place 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.140
 in the case of five we draw and 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.140
 four defeats 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:11.109
 23 15 goals of hsv aktuell 12 here 23 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.130
 to 22 goals and how is it there with you 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:18.010
 Maybe that's why many goals 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.920
 Not only the question is whether gladbach 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.750
 finally find the foreign weakness 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 I do not think she can 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 away win I will guess 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.859
 the game ends in a draw and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.859
 though with 22 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.769
 22 said yes I would even there 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.879
 halfway connect and say as well 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.879
 it ended 2 2
