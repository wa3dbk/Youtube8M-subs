calm today's episode is on the one-armed
farmers<00:00:06.990> walk<00:00:07.200> which<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.830> something<00:00:08.220> that

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
farmers walk which is something that

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.709 
farmers walk which is something that
we're<00:00:08.460> going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.639> use<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.059> order<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.480> rehab

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
we're going to use in order to do rehab

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.930 
we're going to use in order to do rehab
and<00:00:10.170> strengthen<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> quadratus<00:00:11.730> lumborum

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
and strengthen the quadratus lumborum

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.999 
and strengthen the quadratus lumborum
which<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> muscle<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.440> attacks<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
which is a muscle that attacks in the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.320 
which is a muscle that attacks in the
bottom<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.340> your<00:00:14.490> ribs<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.969> down<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> your

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
bottom of your ribs and down to your

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.510 
bottom of your ribs and down to your
iliac<00:00:15.750> crest<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.289> pelvis<00:00:16.650> basically

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
iliac crest of your pelvis basically

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.359 
iliac crest of your pelvis basically
runs<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.510> when<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.650> muscle<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
runs like this and when that muscle is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
runs like this and when that muscle is
held<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.850> place<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.539> muscle<00:00:21.900> contracts

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
held in place that muscle contracts

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.070 
held in place that muscle contracts
isometrically<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:23.789> prevent<00:00:24.240> lateral

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
isometrically it's gonna prevent lateral

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
isometrically it's gonna prevent lateral
trunk<00:00:25.260> flexion<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> reason<00:00:27.210> we're

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
trunk flexion so that's the reason we're

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.910 
trunk flexion so that's the reason we're
going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> one-armed<00:00:28.289> farmers<00:00:28.710> walk

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
going to use a one-armed farmers walk

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.349 
going to use a one-armed farmers walk

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
your shoulders and your hips at parallel

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
your shoulders and your hips at parallel
with<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> ground<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.270> not

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with the ground so that you're not

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.389 
with the ground so that you're not
having<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.809> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> hinging<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.250> on

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
heavy in one hand you kind of pinch out

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
heavy in one hand you kind of pinch out
at<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> hip<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.290> order<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> come<00:00:43.890> maneuver

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
at the hip in order to come maneuver

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
at the hip in order to come maneuver
with<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.870> case<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.410> gonna

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
with it but in this case you're gonna

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
with it but in this case you're gonna
put<00:00:46.739> an<00:00:46.800> emphasis<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.340> shoulder<00:00:48.300> square

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
put an emphasis on shoulder square

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
put an emphasis on shoulder square
pelvis<00:00:49.379> squared<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> parallel<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
pelvis squared and parallel on the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
pelvis squared and parallel on the
ground<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> lot<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
ground you don't need to use a lot of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
ground you don't need to use a lot of
weight<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> might<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.960> change

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
weight because you might actually change

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
weight because you might actually change
out<00:00:55.649> whether<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.340> leaning<00:00:56.940> towards<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
out whether it's leaning towards the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.709 
out whether it's leaning towards the
implement<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:57.870> away<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.410> place<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
implement or away from the in place so I

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
implement or away from the in place so I
start<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:01.140> 50<00:01:01.559> pounds<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> did<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
start out around 50 pounds when I did I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
start out around 50 pounds when I did I
was<00:01:02.370> pretty<00:01:02.640> sore<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> next<00:01:03.000> day<00:01:03.260> life

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
was pretty sore the next day life

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.920 
was pretty sore the next day life
usually<00:01:04.589> uses<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.400> 16<00:01:05.790> kilo<00:01:06.150> kettlebell<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
usually uses like 16 kilo kettlebell and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.230 
usually uses like 16 kilo kettlebell and
so<00:01:07.799> she's<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.310> demonstrate<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:09.000> now

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.490 

nice<00:01:12.240> even<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:13.680> arm<00:01:13.860> deadlift<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:15.500> with

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
nice even one arm deadlift here with

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
nice even one arm deadlift here with
Lita<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:17.939> good

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Lita in the way that's very good

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.710 
Lita in the way that's very good
and<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> shoulders<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.240> pelvis<00:01:21.570> are

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and so the shoulders and the pelvis are

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.539 
and so the shoulders and the pelvis are
square<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.229> nice<00:01:22.710> short<00:01:23.310> deliberate<00:01:23.850> steps

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
square with nice short deliberate steps

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
square with nice short deliberate steps
and<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> garage

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and that's good so we're in the garage

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.609 
and that's good so we're in the garage
it's<00:01:28.320> dark<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.710> normally<00:01:29.640> you'd<00:01:29.790> walk<00:01:30.030> about

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
it's dark out normally you'd walk about

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.179 
it's dark out normally you'd walk about
thirty<00:01:31.619> meters<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.619> we<00:01:34.619> usually<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.070> walk

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
thirty meters or so we usually just walk

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
thirty meters or so we usually just walk
to<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> end<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.700> driveway<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> switch

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to the end of the driveway and switch

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
to the end of the driveway and switch
arms<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.049> doing<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.520> whether<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
arms and we're doing this whether it's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
arms and we're doing this whether it's
waiters<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.299> farms<00:01:39.869> walks<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> type

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
waiters or farms walks so with this type

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
waiters or farms walks so with this type
of<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.240> might<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> once<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.500> twice<00:01:43.530> a
