00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.000
 hello welcome my name is Andrea 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.130
 this is very simple and you are going to make tea 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 ice cream the ingredients are the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:27.730
 following the first thing that we have to 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.109
 make in a bottle we put a liter of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.589
 water we put the bags in and without 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:40.499
 that they go inwards and the 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.499
 we affirm in extreme 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.579
 the other 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.070
 and we affirm them and this is going to allow 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.239
 use the bottle as long as the water 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 do not bump the bags a lot this is because 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 I keep it this way in the refrigerator 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.939
 turn then there the tea goes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.619
 the water is having and this one goes 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.140
 doing the effect we want it to be 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 to get tea flavor and this is what 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.750
 leave it ideal 12 hours since I know that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.700
 that's the most from one day to the next but 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.759
 maybe if I did it in a couple of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.399
 three hours same time it works and it does not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.920
 complicated now if they want tea for the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.259
 shot now as far as what they can do is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.539
 make you prepare with the two bags 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.840
 we avoid so the water boils because 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.939
 if the water boils it comes out a little bit 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010
 I leave bitter already and how this is taken 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.260
 side 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.500
 you will also feel the bitter taste 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.850
 already then avoid that and so can 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.160
 do it in 20 minutes and minus 10 minutes 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 Here I have this this water already 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.420
 is from about 12 hours that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 I would say a little more and you already have the water 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.390
 is completely extended and I 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.390
 I do and we're going to see the tea here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.110
 here we have our tea and this we're going 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.330
 to add 3 tablespoons of honey 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.130
 and if they do not like it they add 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.570
 sugar if you do not like sugar or 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.980
 honey they add sweetener there is no 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.700
 problem what you want already 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 there is honey 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.180
 Y 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.750
 we scramble it costs a bit that the honey 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 dissolve already because the water is freezing 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.140
 then you have to stir a lot 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.110
 to dissolve but apart from that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.100
 there are no problems 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.100
 we come back 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.840
 who else what can we do to him so that 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.750
 give you a different flavor what you 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.870
 want me to do it with raspberry with 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.060
 blueberries with strawberry with lemon 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.489
 orange with grapefruit even but if you 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.950
 like something else so take it spectacular 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.599
 And if the fruit always comes clean 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.329
 that the most important thing that is super 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.849
 indicates the fruit and there are people who 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.980
 add a little juice of something juice 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.109
 lemon or grapefruit juice or juices 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.400
 orange I do not like it very much because it left a 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.590
 little cloudy 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.959
 the issue and I know turbo remains then if 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.400
 they want to make me a little juice what 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.659
 can lan before so that the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.459
 sediments of the remove a little what 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.590
 cloudy and they are here without any 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.329
 problem here in this case I have 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.240
 little orange slices that look 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.340
 spectacular 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.400
 simply 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.160
 the facts within me can you 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.070
 combine if they want 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.080
 orange with lemon or be everything 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.940
 pure scale of subtract raspberry 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.000
 strawberry aranda what is super rich 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.950
 this we leave it 10 minutes inside the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.300
 fridge 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.580
 this is going to be the guardense side 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.100
 we have it for a long time those in 10 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.410
 minutes just for him to grab a 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.280
 little taste of the orange already or of what 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.280
 that you dates 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.000
 there they look how it looks but the only thing 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.049
 What is left now is to try our 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.049
 keyboard to see how it was 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.900
 better than a drink to buy 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.990
 drinks and we have a refreshment here 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.590
 totally natural totally light and 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.910
 refreshing and very easy to do hopefully
