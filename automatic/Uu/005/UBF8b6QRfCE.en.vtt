00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
with accents today we're pretty excited
about<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.770> yeah<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.730> really<00:00:18.029> incredible

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
about that yeah it's a really incredible

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.450 
about that yeah it's a really incredible
piece<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.840> motion<00:00:19.170> capture<00:00:19.560> technology<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
piece of motion capture technology and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.070 
piece of motion capture technology and
what<00:00:20.730> sets<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.029> apart<00:00:21.119> from<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> rest<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.859 
what sets it apart from all the rest of
the<00:00:22.619> devices<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.510> bring<00:00:24.720> it

the devices is you can really bring it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.420 
the devices is you can really bring it
on<00:00:24.960> location<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.650> don't<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
on location you don't need to be in a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.279 
on location you don't need to be in a
studio<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.029> infrared<00:00:27.390> cameras<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> do

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
studio with infrared cameras what you do

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.779 
studio with infrared cameras what you do
is<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> put<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.010> bunch<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.609> little

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
is you put on a bunch of little

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.669 
is you put on a bunch of little
Bluetooth<00:00:30.090> nodes<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.869> accelerometers<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
Bluetooth nodes with accelerometers and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.040 
Bluetooth nodes with accelerometers and
gyroscopes<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> bring<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.660> that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
gyroscopes and you can bring that that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
gyroscopes and you can bring that that
motion<00:00:34.530> capture<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> set<00:00:35.670> yeah<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> not

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
motion capture to the set yeah and not

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
motion capture to the set yeah and not
only<00:00:36.390> are<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.230> stuff

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
only are we using it for stuff

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
only are we using it for stuff
practically<00:00:38.129> where<00:00:38.370> he<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> interacting<00:00:39.390> with

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
practically where he is interacting with

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
practically where he is interacting with
the<00:00:39.540> robot<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:39.989> directly<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.280> also

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the robot that's directly there but also

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
the robot that's directly there but also
we're<00:00:41.940> doing<00:00:42.120> stuff<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.480> usually<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.899> would

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we're doing stuff that usually we would

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
we're doing stuff that usually we would
do<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> soundstage<00:00:43.800> where<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
do on a soundstage where you have you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
do on a soundstage where you have you
know<00:00:45.360> infrared<00:00:45.899> cameras<00:00:46.289> everywhere<00:00:46.590> we're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
know infrared cameras everywhere we're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.350 
know infrared cameras everywhere we're
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> putting<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.879> robot<00:00:48.210> into

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
going to be to putting a robot into

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to be to putting a robot into
plated<00:00:48.870> scenes<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> have

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
plated scenes and we don't have to have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
plated scenes and we don't have to have
any<00:00:51.809> sort<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> other<00:00:52.530> location<00:00:53.190> other<00:00:53.370> than

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
any sort of other location other than

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
any sort of other location other than
just<00:00:53.850> filming<00:00:54.390> where<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.840> happen<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
just filming where we happen to be so in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
just filming where we happen to be so in
between<00:00:56.399> takes<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.449> able<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.410> go

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
between takes here we're able to just go

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
between takes here we're able to just go
oh<00:00:58.649> yeah<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> pick<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.640> shot<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
