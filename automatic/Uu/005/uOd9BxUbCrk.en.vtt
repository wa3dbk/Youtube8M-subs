looking down at the iPad on my lap so I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.880 
looking down at the iPad on my lap so I

think um my hair what I'm going to do

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.990 
think um my hair what I'm going to do
now<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:35.280> let<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.490> grow<00:02:35.640> because

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
now is just let it grow because

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.790 
now is just let it grow because
obviously<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:36.810> trying<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.020> grow<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.320> so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
obviously I'm trying to grow it out so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.710 
obviously I'm trying to grow it out so
I'm<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.310> let<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.030> go<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.480> nice

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I'm going to just let it go into nice

long<00:02:40.050> hair<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> think<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.370> might<00:02:41.550> dye

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
long hair and then I think I might dye

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.750 
long hair and then I think I might dye
it<00:02:41.790> black<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.260> live<00:02:43.470> XL<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.160> whatever

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it black with the live XL or whatever

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.750 
it black with the live XL or whatever
because<00:02:45.270> dark<00:02:45.960> head<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.470> tend<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> find<00:02:47.430> suits

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
because dark head I tend to find suits

because dark head I tend to find suits
me<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> lot<00:02:48.120> more<00:02:48.330> than<00:02:48.540> highlights<00:02:49.500> and
