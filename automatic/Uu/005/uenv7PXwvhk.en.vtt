he<00:02:01.070> did<00:02:01.190> about<00:02:01.400> 15<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.910> these<00:02:02.120> airs<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.840> was

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
he did about 15 of these airs and I was

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.690 
he did about 15 of these airs and I was
running<00:02:03.170> around<00:02:03.380> trying<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.010> trying<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.550> get

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
him perfectly above the bridge and then

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.650 
him perfectly above the bridge and then
I<00:02:06.650> saw<00:02:06.950> these<00:02:07.130> guys<00:02:07.370> hanging<00:02:07.730> out<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:08.629> I

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
I saw these guys hanging out so I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.690 
I saw these guys hanging out so I
decided<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.200> put<00:02:09.349> them<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.769> action<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:10.340> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
decided to put them in the action and it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.150 
decided to put them in the action and it
makes<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.300> richly<00:02:11.620> composed<00:02:12.620> photo<00:02:12.980> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
makes it a more richly composed photo to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.070 
makes it a more richly composed photo to
have<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.580> foreground<00:02:14.090> stuff<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
have this foreground stuff the

have this foreground stuff the
background<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.680> then<00:02:15.769> have<00:02:15.980> day<00:02:16.280> 1

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
background and then have day 1

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
background and then have day 1
purposefully<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.700> sky<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.390> said<00:02:20.690> I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
composition it's really fun to try to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.410 
composition it's really fun to try to
find<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:10.050> way<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.400> line<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.730> obstacle<00:03:12.300> in

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
find a way to line up the obstacle in

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020 
find a way to line up the obstacle in
the<00:03:12.510> skater<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.290> way<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.770> makes<00:03:14.340> these

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the skater in a way that makes these

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.930 
the skater in a way that makes these
strong<00:03:15.480> bold<00:03:15.960> shapes<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.520> instance<00:03:17.820> we

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
strong bold shapes so for instance we

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.480 
strong bold shapes so for instance we
got<00:03:18.090> Josh<00:03:18.390> harmony<00:03:19.350> tail<00:03:19.560> sliding<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.190> ledge

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
got Josh harmony tail sliding this ledge

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.300 
got Josh harmony tail sliding this ledge
that<00:03:20.670> says<00:03:20.880> push<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.600> but<00:03:22.350> with<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> shadow

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that says push on it but with the shadow

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.720 
that says push on it but with the shadow
the<00:03:23.940> light<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.600> bank<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.440> sky<00:03:25.710> I<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.460> able<00:03:26.550> to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
the light the bank the sky I was able to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.730 
the light the bank the sky I was able to
get<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.180> all<00:03:27.450> these<00:03:27.750> different<00:03:28.140> triangles

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
get like all these different triangles

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.190 
get like all these different triangles
and<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.490> really<00:03:29.730> kind<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.240> geometric

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
and make this really kind of geometric

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.380 
and make this really kind of geometric
design<00:03:31.410> II<00:03:31.920> looking<00:03:32.430> thing<00:03:32.670> which<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.120> kind<00:03:33.330> of

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
design II looking thing which is kind of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.750 
design II looking thing which is kind of
fun<00:03:33.630> same<00:03:34.140> thing<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.250> curve<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
fun same thing like the curve of the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080 
fun same thing like the curve of the
pool<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.300> then<00:03:37.020> how<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:37.890> achieve<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
pool and then how do I achieve that that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.420 
pool and then how do I achieve that that
nice<00:03:39.360> line<00:03:39.720> was<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.800> put<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
nice line was it was to put all the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550 
nice line was it was to put all the
lights<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> bottom<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.200> get<00:03:43.410> that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
lights on the bottom so you get that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 
lights on the bottom so you get that
nice<00:03:43.770> curve<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.150> kind<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.540> dramatic

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
nice curve and it's a kind of a dramatic

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.780 
nice curve and it's a kind of a dramatic
composition<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.830> way<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.550> can't

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
composition that way and like you can't

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.240 
composition that way and like you can't
help<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.050> look<00:03:49.740> at<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> skater

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
help but you know look at the skater

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.920 
help but you know look at the skater
there<00:03:50.550> he<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.360> not<00:03:51.540> mixed<00:03:51.840> up

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
there he is you know it's not mixed up

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.050 
there he is you know it's not mixed up
when<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:53.040> get<00:03:53.190> up<00:03:53.310> high<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.670> look<00:03:53.820> down

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
when you can get up high and look down

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.480 
when you can get up high and look down
the<00:03:54.420> horizon<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.500> an<00:03:55.650> issue<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:56.400> know

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
the horizon is not an issue you know

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.090 
the horizon is not an issue you know
it's<00:03:56.640> either<00:03:56.760> concrete<00:03:57.480> stairs<00:03:58.020> grass<00:03:58.680> in

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
it's either concrete stairs grass in

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.250 
it's either concrete stairs grass in
this<00:03:59.220> case<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.910> deck<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:01.020> flat

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
this case it's the deck and the flat

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910 
this case it's the deck and the flat
bottom<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.770> bowl<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:04.350> know<00:04:04.470> instead<00:04:04.860> of

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
bottom of this bowl you know instead of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.890 
bottom of this bowl you know instead of
looking<00:04:05.400> across<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.820> bunch<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.330> jagged<00:04:06.720> lines

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
looking across a bunch of jagged lines

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.780 
looking across a bunch of jagged lines
and<00:04:07.170> dealing<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:07.560> all<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.670> in

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and dealing with all this in

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.400 
and dealing with all this in
the<00:04:08.880> background<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.540> get<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:09.810> high<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.320> then

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the background you get up high and then

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.080 
the background you get up high and then
you<00:04:10.500> get<00:04:10.620> these<00:04:10.740> two<00:04:10.800> clean<00:04:11.430> lines<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.880> by<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
you get these two clean lines and by a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.120 
you get these two clean lines and by a
bonus<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.930> third<00:04:13.620> line<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.070> you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
bonus you get this third line so you

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.060 
bonus you get this third line so you
have<00:04:14.340> those<00:04:14.520> three<00:04:14.600> even<00:04:15.600> lines<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.859> makes

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
have those three even lines and it makes

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.890 
have those three even lines and it makes
it<00:04:17.220> much<00:04:17.340> more<00:04:17.580> pleasing<00:04:17.910> photo<00:04:18.330> than<00:04:18.660> if<00:04:18.780> you

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
it much more pleasing photo than if you

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900 
it much more pleasing photo than if you
were<00:04:19.020> trying<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.500> shoot<00:04:19.739> him<00:04:19.890> with<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.580> dark

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
were trying to shoot him with this dark

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.110 
were trying to shoot him with this dark
weird<00:04:21.209> background<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.940> things<00:04:23.940> like

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
weird background back here things like

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.930 
weird background back here things like
that<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.260> other<00:04:25.380> outside<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.580> can<00:04:26.790> get

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that on the other outside you can get

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.810 
that on the other outside you can get
low<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.840> lay<00:04:28.620> down<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.100> ground<00:04:29.340> get<00:04:29.610> them

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
low so lay down on the ground get them

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.270 
low so lay down on the ground get them
up<00:04:29.970> in<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> sky<00:04:30.510> instead<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.320> roon<00:04:31.530> mixing<00:04:32.100> up

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
up in the sky instead of roon mixing up

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.070 
up in the sky instead of roon mixing up
with<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:32.610> wall<00:04:32.940> looking<00:04:33.510> like<00:04:33.690> he's<00:04:33.840> doing

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
with this wall looking like he's doing

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.360 
with this wall looking like he's doing
an<00:04:34.200> axle<00:04:34.500> stall<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.919> wall<00:04:35.100> or<00:04:35.340> something

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
an axle stall on the wall or something

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.570 
an axle stall on the wall or something
or<00:04:35.910> up<00:04:36.419> in<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> tree<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.169> get<00:04:38.160> underneath<00:04:38.460> him

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
or up in a tree you get underneath him

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.600 
or up in a tree you get underneath him
and<00:04:38.820> get<00:04:39.090> him<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.570> sky<00:04:40.310> same<00:04:41.310> with<00:04:41.460> this

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
and get him up in the sky same with this

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
and get him up in the sky same with this
like<00:04:41.880> in<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.120> case

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
like in this case

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.320 
like in this case
my<00:04:42.780> camera<00:04:43.200> set<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.100> step<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:45.060> I'm<00:04:45.180> not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
my camera set on the step like I'm not

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.670 
my camera set on the step like I'm not
even<00:04:45.420> looking<00:04:45.630> through<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.290> like<00:04:46.470> I'm

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
even looking through it it's like I'm

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.130 
even looking through it it's like I'm
holding<00:04:46.920> it<00:04:47.190> on<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.400> stair<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:48.690> can<00:04:48.930> get

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
holding it on a stair so I can get

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.100 
holding it on a stair so I can get
underneath<00:04:49.620> his<00:04:50.010> board<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.640> make<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.660> look<00:04:51.900> as

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
underneath his board and make it look as

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.960 
underneath his board and make it look as
clean<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:52.620> possible<00:04:52.700> even<00:04:53.700> though<00:04:53.790> there's

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
clean as possible even though there's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.670 
clean as possible even though there's
some<00:04:54.090> trees<00:04:54.330> he's<00:04:54.660> kind<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:54.900> isolated<00:04:55.530> and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
some trees he's kind of isolated and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.800 
some trees he's kind of isolated and
popping<00:04:56.070> off<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.400> rail<00:04:56.610> he's<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:57.420> mixed<00:04:57.750> up

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
popping off the rail he's not mixed up

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.090 
popping off the rail he's not mixed up
with<00:04:57.960> this<00:04:58.140> building<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:58.800> kind<00:04:59.040> of

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
with this building and that kind of

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.870 
with this building and that kind of
stuff<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.820> we're<00:05:02.970> here<00:05:03.090> at<00:05:03.180> our<00:05:03.330> toes<00:05:04.880> skating

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
stuff so we're here at our toes skating

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.220 
stuff so we're here at our toes skating
the<00:05:05.940> pool<00:05:06.150> we're<00:05:06.630> going<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.810> put<00:05:06.960> some<00:05:07.140> of

the pool we're going to put some of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.340 
the pool we're going to put some of
these<00:05:07.320> principles<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.670> test<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.150> get<00:05:09.350> good

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
these principles to the test to get good

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.880 
these principles to the test to get good

behind him instead of a bunch of trees
and<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:21.600> people<00:05:22.110> it'll<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:22.650> be<00:05:22.890> that

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
and and people it'll just be that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.700 
and and people it'll just be that
white<00:05:23.720> background<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:25.110> hopefully<00:05:25.530> that'll

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
white background and hopefully that'll

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.340 
white background and hopefully that'll
give<00:05:25.890> us<00:05:25.920> a<00:05:26.040> clean<00:05:26.520> composition<00:05:27.260> look<00:05:28.260> nice<00:05:28.470> I

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
give us a clean composition look nice I

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.880 
give us a clean composition look nice I
think<00:05:31.350> we<00:05:31.470> got<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:33.170> lot<00:05:34.170> of<00:05:34.320> times<00:05:34.530> if<00:05:34.830> you

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
think we got it a lot of times if you

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.040 
think we got it a lot of times if you
have<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.160> cluttered<00:05:35.460> horizon<00:05:36.150> line<00:05:36.360> with<00:05:36.600> trees

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
have a cluttered horizon line with trees

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.040 
have a cluttered horizon line with trees
and<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.830> poles<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.180> weird<00:05:39.660> like<00:05:39.840> that

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
and and poles and weird like that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.900 
and and poles and weird like that
you<00:05:40.590> can<00:05:40.710> get<00:05:40.860> up<00:05:40.980> high<00:05:41.130> get<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.520> top<00:05:41.700> of<00:05:41.850> the

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
you can get up high get on top of the

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.240 
you can get up high get on top of the
car<00:05:42.150> get<00:05:42.450> up<00:05:42.540> on<00:05:42.660> a<00:05:42.690> roof<00:05:42.960> getting<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.380> tree<00:05:43.680> for

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
car get up on a roof getting a tree for

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.490 
car get up on a roof getting a tree for
this<00:05:44.610> one<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> brought<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.150> ladder<00:05:45.480> and<00:05:46.200> then<00:05:46.410> I

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
this one I brought a ladder and then I

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.290 
this one I brought a ladder and then I
could<00:05:46.650> get<00:05:46.920> up<00:05:47.040> on<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.340> ladder<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.820> look

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
could get up on that ladder and look

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.180 
could get up on that ladder and look
down<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.540> line<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:48.900> instead<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:49.980> in<00:05:50.100> the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
down the line and instead of in the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.980 
down the line and instead of in the
background<00:05:50.370> having<00:05:50.970> trees<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.570> other<00:05:51.690> kind

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
background having trees and other kind

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.170 
background having trees and other kind
of<00:05:52.080> things<00:05:52.260> all<00:05:52.620> we<00:05:52.860> have<00:05:53.070> is<00:05:53.280> concrete<00:05:53.850> in<00:05:54.000> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
of things all we have is concrete in the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.970 
of things all we have is concrete in the
back<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.540> them<00:05:54.630> then<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.170> can<00:05:55.350> kind<00:05:55.560> of<00:05:55.620> square

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
back of them then you can kind of square

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.000 
back of them then you can kind of square
them<00:05:56.190> off<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:56.640> they<00:05:56.670> fit<00:05:57.030> right<00:05:57.240> in<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.570> frame

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
them off so they fit right in that frame

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.590 
them off so they fit right in that frame
exactly<00:05:59.010> how<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.190> want<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.550> this<00:06:00.060> is<00:06:00.240> also<00:06:00.450> a

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.930 
terrain and a pool of tril easy because
you<00:06:06.180> have<00:06:06.300> those<00:06:06.390> nice<00:06:06.630> curves<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.730> for<00:06:08.730> Street

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
you have those nice curves I for Street

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.580 
you have those nice curves I for Street
skating<00:06:09.180> it<00:06:09.360> could<00:06:09.510> be<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.780> rail<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.290> stairs

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
skating it could be the rail the stairs

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.680 
skating it could be the rail the stairs
the<00:06:10.950> top<00:06:11.160> of<00:06:11.310> a<00:06:11.400> wall<00:06:11.610> some<00:06:12.300> like<00:06:12.330> that

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
the top of a wall some like that

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.780 
the top of a wall some like that
so<00:06:13.440> we<00:06:13.560> showed<00:06:13.770> how<00:06:13.920> to<00:06:13.980> achieve<00:06:14.160> clean

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
so we showed how to achieve clean

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.980 
so we showed how to achieve clean
compositions<00:06:15.390> from<00:06:15.510> getting<00:06:15.720> up<00:06:15.810> high

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
compositions from getting up high

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.950 
compositions from getting up high
another<00:06:16.680> choice<00:06:16.920> is<00:06:17.190> getting<00:06:17.490> down<00:06:17.610> low

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
another choice is getting down low

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.110 
another choice is getting down low
getting<00:06:18.960> underneath<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.650> action<00:06:20.040> so<00:06:20.340> we<00:06:20.940> got

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
getting underneath the action so we got

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.180 
getting underneath the action so we got
Grayson<00:06:21.750> doing<00:06:21.960> some<00:06:22.140> sick<00:06:22.410> backside<00:06:22.860> Ollie's

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
Grayson doing some sick backside Ollie's

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.350 
Grayson doing some sick backside Ollie's
and<00:06:23.370> I'm<00:06:23.520> going<00:06:23.670> to<00:06:23.700> critter<00:06:23.970> around

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
and I'm going to critter around

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.420 
and I'm going to critter around
underneath<00:06:24.990> them<00:06:25.200> looking<00:06:25.980> up<00:06:26.130> with<00:06:26.280> the

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
underneath them looking up with the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.700 
underneath them looking up with the
fisheye<00:06:26.790> lens<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.360> try<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:27.900> position<00:06:28.230> it<00:06:28.500> so

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
fisheye lens and try to position it so

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.620 
fisheye lens and try to position it so
right<00:06:29.280> when<00:06:29.460> he's<00:06:29.580> in<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.850> peak<00:06:30.150> of<00:06:30.300> his<00:06:30.390> Ollie

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
right when he's in the peak of his Ollie

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.530 
right when he's in the peak of his Ollie
I<00:06:30.960> get<00:06:31.350> him<00:06:31.470> perfectly<00:06:31.920> in<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.220> sky
