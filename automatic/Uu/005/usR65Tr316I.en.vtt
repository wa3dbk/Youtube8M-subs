00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
course to give them an idea of how books
are<00:01:39.810> structured<00:01:40.820> generally<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> think

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
are structured generally I think

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
are structured generally I think
children<00:01:42.509> will<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> idea<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
children will have the idea of the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160 
children will have the idea of the
beginning<00:01:44.369> middle<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> end<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> story<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
beginning middle and end to a story and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
beginning middle and end to a story and
that's<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.860> well<00:01:47.040> ingrained

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that's going to be pretty well ingrained

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.539 
that's going to be pretty well ingrained
into<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.030> they've<00:01:48.180> ever<00:01:48.329> watched<00:01:48.659> movies
