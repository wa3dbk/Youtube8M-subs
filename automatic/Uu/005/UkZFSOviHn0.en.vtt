00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:09.420
 you make a meal a meat made 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 something will always remain the residue 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 of fat from the panela 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.539
 finally an egg will remain fat 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.100
 in many situations the fat you then 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.750
 will play the sink right? 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 usually throw some detergent 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.910
 to break and throw in the sink and this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 fat 10 c living at home or 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 apartment does not interest this fat 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.670
 goes if she does not get a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.680
 device that calls the fat box 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 which can be implemented under the sink 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 or elsewhere 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:51.270
 she goes to the sewage network in the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 sewer she sticks to the walls in the hammock 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.730
 It helps shape doughs to form cakes. 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.930
 on the net along with hair and other 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.120
 regimes played by the population and then 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 that top in the evening when the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.479
 sewer clogs what happens when 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.549
 network other topic sewage in natura 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.530
 overflows and falls in the rivers 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 so when you do not have the box 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 fat you pollute those is something 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 concrete ie the fat you play 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 network help and Tupi to the sewage network and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.500
 this network will overflow and will pollute 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 rivers 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.329
 therefore it is fundamental and obligatory to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 fat box installation that helps 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.299
 to retain this residue then it is clean is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 played in the trash does not put a wise man 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.970
 throw your garbage goes as waste is and then 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.040
 then we protect the rivers as far as 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 in which the quantity 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.380
 interruption and also facilitates the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.360
 treatment because at the treatment station 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 of fat forms a film that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 a residue more difficult for 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.790
 always treat the solution at source in the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.619
 person's home by reducing and 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 applies at all in the environment 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.270
 then the importance of the fat box 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.270
 of fat retention
