completely touchscreen device and unlike

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.759 
completely touchscreen device and unlike
some<00:00:38.149> of<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.329> older<00:00:38.750> iterations<00:00:39.379> like<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
some of the older iterations like the

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.650
