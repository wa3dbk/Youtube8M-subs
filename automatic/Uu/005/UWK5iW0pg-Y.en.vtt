 Today I'm here to tell you how it was 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.160
 early life of my six 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.080
 first few months I think it does not have much 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.150
 everybody has a doubt and there are some 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.939
 questions of what it's like to live with 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 else which is what changes in life 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.039
 two people 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.980
 and to complete still live out then 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 It was a lot of change for me and I wanted 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.059
 I just got married in a little while 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 it goes to you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.489
 but before you say how it is now I 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.770
 I need to talk like I was before I got married. 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.920
 he was a very organized person 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.570
 Only then do you know that I loved to wash dishes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 ironing clothes helped a lot, Mother. 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.799
 admitted the need to wake up my 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.740
 God, not really. I was not even one. 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.619
 little nothing that I hardly the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 my mother in things do not go to them 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.689
 damn set table promosul present 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.400
 for anything I really had 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.680
 too lazy 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.670
 I have never had this initiative in order to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.250
 itaju give is doing was not mine 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 to do this was not the lack of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 This is serious. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 five minutes 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 My mother always did the part of her and she 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.299
 always told me to do it when 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.640
 I did and before I married 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.369
 one of the rodrigo's doubts was whether I was going to 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.579
 really give a house account if I pass 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.240
 clothes I was going to do the dishes to clean the house 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.240
 clean everything 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.100
 He was afraid of this people, but thanks to 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.780
 God did not give up and when he asked me 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.140
 in married 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.720
 the first moment only joy, not only that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 Then they start to beat the doubts and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.010
 Afraid you will not know that you will. 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.930
 to do it because I'm very young and I 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.050
 I thought I was not going to give too 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.910
 we spent six months home 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.350
 was also a very short time of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.790
 wedding preparation and change stay away 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.459
 of my mother and my mother who was mine 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 base in order to help things and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 scared but I did not give up too 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.920
 When I found out I came here to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.980
 people still saw in the holiday season my 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 parents were with us the week 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.350
 when they came back desperate team 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.819
 alone in the kitchen she had never done 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:04.530
 rice beans the first region of the 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.780
 hard so saltless so dull I started to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.049
 cry your cry and enjoy, stop talking 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.230
 who would never know kitchen in life 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.610
 I spent the first week weeping 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.470
 thinking that I really could not 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.560
 then the morning began rodrigo 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.269
 survived in God made nowadays I 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.730
 it was alright 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.680
 In the beginning I got very 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.940
 relationship I spent some time like this 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.890
 very hard for me because besides changing 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.840
 totally in the life of doing things that 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.140
 I never did it before 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.540
 Now I've seen myself doing everything in 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.180
 another country with another language 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.680
 all friends of all my family 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.019
 Rodrigo's name too, so we 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.859
 has to support the role of rodrigo more 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.230
 It was very important he did not help 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.180
 morally giving me support in 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.720
 every time how much very much 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.910
 stressed and he could understand and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.269
 had patience a lot of patience in the beginning 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.680
 poor but I think there is doubt that 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.450
 a lot of people have the head and 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.860
 especially I had another 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.170
 He had to get married really, it's not difficult. 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.739
 then married people is wonderful to 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.120
 people are super good and one thing 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.130
 important that you can be talking about my 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.850
 marriage is that you marry to do the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.979
 the other happy because when you do well 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.979
 Another person, you feel good, too. 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.990
 Have a more loving relationship, will you? 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.750
 has a calmer relationship 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.030
 Where do you have more fun than you do? 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.000
 There are fights if you 're going through 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.979
 this has no doubt do not stop 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.220
 to go through this moment of marriage that 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.320
 It's so beautiful because it's hard in life. 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.690
 Everyone has every moment of your life. 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.520
 will have some difficulty but when 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.160
 Do you have any people for you to do? 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.490
 this walk together if you love each other 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.070
 if I catch it's worth and you do not lose 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.070
 nothing with it you actually 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.169
 otherwise you live alone you 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.930
 lived beside someone you love 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.139
 It's wonderful for this and a lot of 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.030
 responsibility really is more just me 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.800
 brought positive balance 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:21.060
 today I am much more responsible for a led 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.700
 home is much more responsible today. 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.650
