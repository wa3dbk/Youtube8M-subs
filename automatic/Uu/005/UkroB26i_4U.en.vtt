and they'll add a bit more shading now
I'm<00:03:16.760> gonna<00:03:16.880> continue<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.360> same<00:03:17.540> pattern<00:03:18.020> of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
I'm gonna continue the same pattern of

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.360 
I'm gonna continue the same pattern of
cross<00:03:18.890> hatching<00:03:19.340> all<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:20.120> way<00:03:20.239> across<00:03:20.569> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
cross hatching all the way across and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.830 
cross hatching all the way across and
then<00:03:22.370> down<00:03:25.810> say<00:03:26.810> anything<00:03:27.020> along<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:28.840> all

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
then down say anything along here all

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.960 
then down say anything along here all
the<00:03:30.019> way<00:03:30.140> across<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:32.330> down<00:03:33.550> now<00:03:34.550> let's<00:03:34.760> see<00:03:34.880> if

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the way across and down now let's see if

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.460 
the way across and down now let's see if
you<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.180> recognize<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:35.750> magic<00:03:36.230> word<00:03:36.380> that

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
you can recognize this magic word that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
add a few more stalactites going on

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.080 
add a few more stalactites going on

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
them a lot you recognize it easily gonna

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.890 
them a lot you recognize it easily gonna
continue<00:04:34.850> my<00:04:34.970> shading<00:04:35.419> all<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.600> way<00:04:35.720> down

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
continue my shading all the way down

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.070 
continue my shading all the way down
here<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:37.870> want<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.930> add<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:40.300> overlaps<00:04:41.300> flag<00:04:41.780> type

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
here I want to add a overlaps flag type

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.710 
here I want to add a overlaps flag type
back<00:04:42.320> here<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> smaller<00:04:42.950> one<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:44.180> maybe<00:04:44.600> a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
little droopier one I like using droop

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.219 
little droopier one I like using droop
because<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.479> makes<00:04:47.660> things<00:04:47.840> look<00:04:47.990> at<00:04:48.110> they're

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
because it makes things look at they're

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.830 
because it makes things look at they're
really<00:04:48.440> hanging<00:04:48.740> really<00:04:49.100> loose<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.690> fun<00:04:50.690> on

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
the side of the paper right here kind of

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.190 
the side of the paper right here kind of
neat<00:04:53.660> huh<00:04:54.400> all<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.580> way<00:04:55.729> down<00:04:55.970> now<00:04:56.300> I'll<00:04:57.020> put<00:04:57.169> a

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
neat huh all the way down now I'll put a

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.980 
neat huh all the way down now I'll put a
smaller<00:04:57.590> one<00:04:57.830> up<00:04:57.979> here<00:04:58.490> over<00:04:59.030> laughing<00:04:59.720> in

front and then how about just some rocks
around<00:05:04.100> rocks<00:05:04.430> right<00:05:04.760> here

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
around rocks right here

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.960 
around rocks right here
it<00:05:06.050> may<00:05:06.169> be<00:05:06.229> one<00:05:06.560> drooping<00:05:07.190> right<00:05:07.400> back<00:05:07.610> behind

it may be one drooping right back behind

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.300 
it may be one drooping right back behind
there<00:05:08.389> and<00:05:08.539> I'll<00:05:09.050> take<00:05:09.169> my<00:05:09.289> black<00:05:09.560> I'll<00:05:10.010> still

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
there and I'll take my black I'll still

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.340 
there and I'll take my black I'll still
about<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> few<00:05:10.789> of<00:05:10.910> these<00:05:11.000> rocks<00:05:11.300> like<00:05:12.139> this

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
about a few of these rocks like this

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.219 
about a few of these rocks like this
rock<00:05:12.560> will<00:05:12.710> be<00:05:12.830> silhouetted<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.960> side<00:05:15.139> of

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
rock will be silhouetted in this side of

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.980 
rock will be silhouetted in this side of
the<00:05:15.289> rock

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.719 

and<00:05:19.500> see<00:05:19.680> how<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.919> all<00:05:19.979> automatically<00:05:20.520> makes

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
and see how it all automatically makes

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.510 
and see how it all automatically makes
it<00:05:20.820> look<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:20.970> little<00:05:21.090> more<00:05:21.270> interesting

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
it look a little more interesting

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.189 
it look a little more interesting
because<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.669> have<00:05:23.699> that<00:05:23.970> black<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.690> darkens

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
because you have that black that darkens

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.480 
because you have that black that darkens
in<00:05:25.350> there<00:05:25.470> now<00:05:25.620> that's<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.919> lot<00:05:26.039> of<00:05:26.100> courage<00:05:26.460> to

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
in there now that's a lot of courage to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.060 
in there now that's a lot of courage to
