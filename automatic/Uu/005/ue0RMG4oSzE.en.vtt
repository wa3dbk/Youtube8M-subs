00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
what this is this is pretty decent

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.069 
what this is this is pretty decent
though<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> mood<00:01:54.840> for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
though if I was in the mood for

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
though if I was in the mood for
something<00:01:55.259> along<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.740> line<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.219> would<00:01:56.640> get

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
something along this line I would get

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.620 
something along this line I would get
this<00:01:57.270> again<00:01:57.770> one<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> problem<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.399> like

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
this again one of the problem with like

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
this again one of the problem with like
gravy<00:02:00.630> bowls<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.590> chicken<00:02:01.920> bowls<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
gravy bowls are like chicken bowls if

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.459 
gravy bowls are like chicken bowls if
it's<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> specific<00:02:03.960> place<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> really

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's not from a specific place I really

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's not from a specific place I really
like<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.369> I'd<00:02:05.549> rather<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
like I just I'd rather have like one of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109

my good places with like rice I think I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
my good places with like rice I think I
think<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.420> more<00:02:09.599> inclined<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.170> chicken

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
think I'm more inclined to have chicken

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.619 
think I'm more inclined to have chicken
with<00:02:10.920> rice<00:02:11.129> than<00:02:11.430> chicken<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:12.330> mashed

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
with rice than chicken with mashed

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.700 
with rice than chicken with mashed
potatoes<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710

or have it like home-cooked I mean
home-cooked<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.750> much<00:02:15.990> better<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.470> type

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
home-cooked is much better in this type

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.500 
home-cooked is much better in this type
of<00:02:16.650> thing<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:18.000> got<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> chicken<00:02:18.450> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
bypassing the everything else and just

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.910 
bypassing the everything else and just

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
is kind of a it's kind of a standard for

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080 
is kind of a it's kind of a standard for
bowls<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.040> general<00:02:29.430> usually<00:02:29.850> they're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
bowls in general usually they're

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.310 
bowls in general usually they're
actually<00:02:30.360> more<00:02:30.540> than<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.990> like<00:02:31.110> rice

bowls<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:32.370> most<00:02:32.580> places<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.170> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
bowls at most places but I think this is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.110 
bowls at most places but I think this is
worth<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> price<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.100> really<00:02:35.400> tasty<00:02:35.610> I'm
