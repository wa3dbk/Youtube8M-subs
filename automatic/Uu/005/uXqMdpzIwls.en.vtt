 We offer a lot of possibilities 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.240
 Eventually somehow come to us 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 this can be done while studying in 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.790
 Internships we do

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.080
 can develop as a bachelor graduate 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.730
 These are ways of getting started 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.460
 next to the normal direct access 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.710
 Of course that maybe the classic one 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.739
 Model is the most used one we have 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.720
 trainee programs of mel gibsons 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.790
 credit specials program where it comes to 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.620
 Fach runway goes over at the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.720

 there is boni to manager the program 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.339
 this is our program for the leadership 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.620
 runway where the goal is really at the 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.049
 spot potential early enough to recognize 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.839
 to develop within the company 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.909
 Basically it is like that when you're in 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.799
 an area comes in with a 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.280
 for the first time the possibilities arise 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.020
 to get to know each other 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.760
 the area gives any topics at all 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.010
 Anyone who is my colleague 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.030
 as well as different ones 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.189
 entry programs are in which one 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.780
 professionally deepened as the specialist becomes 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.430
 we need that is easy from 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.649
 of course, also completely to our company 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.420
 important through this whole seminar on 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.240
 At the beginning , therefore , you may also choose others 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.530
 people who are just beginning or in total 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.640
 other areas know this 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 means one has actually very fast 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.979
 a very big own network and 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.780
 a lot of help at the place so this 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.909
 all networking and help each other 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.710
 he is very strongly supported here too 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.770
 from the different areas that 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.619
 has internationality at bosch 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.630
 actually two pages for me 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.479
 One is the question to what extent am I 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.579
 as a participant in a position abroad 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.319
 and go after him again 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.310
 college just foreign experience too 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.920
 collect 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.270
 this possibility exists within the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.030
 program is there such a thing 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.130
 foreign station from four to six 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.009
 months is that means everyone 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.460
 Participants of the program goes for this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.040
 time to one 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.170
 Bosch's location abroad, on the other hand 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.510
 is it so my equivalents 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 Colleagues in England in France 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.870
 Italy and Sweden 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.640
 that means even if I put it in so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
 a regional structure again 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.790
 I already have a German structure 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
 a lot of opportunity if I am today 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.880
 someone would ask what do I think 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 at all from the company bosch as 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.570
 employer then i would him 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.630
 probably answer a lot 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.660
 I think Bosch is an employer of 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.760
 From my point of view very strong on the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.860
 personality of a single eighth 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.860
 and on the other side shows me 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 a lot of possibilities 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.530
 what i can learn professionally where i am 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.530
 can be technically active
