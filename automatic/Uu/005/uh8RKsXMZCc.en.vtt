actually<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:43.340> lot<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:45.140> strings<00:00:46.140> blocks

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
actually a lot of these strings blocks

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
actually a lot of these strings blocks
fell<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.000> during<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.629> shipping<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.260> had<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fell out during the shipping so i had to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
fell out during the shipping so i had to
dig<00:00:50.520> through<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.000> box<00:00:51.210> again<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.840> find<00:00:52.050> them

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
dig through the box again to find them

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.529 
dig through the box again to find them
luckily<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:52.980> find<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.309> b<00:00:56.309> string

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
luckily i find all of them the b string

luckily i find all of them the b string
block<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> snapped<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> half<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
block you just snapped in half so you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.479 
block you just snapped in half so you
can<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.800> but<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.829> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so you can see you can still see the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.200 
so you can see you can still see the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
smooth you can't really feel that the

crack is there but you can absolutely
see<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> prettiest<00:01:48.509> fix<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
see it it's not the prettiest fix but it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.510 
see it it's not the prettiest fix but it
works<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.390> hasn't<00:01:51.720> broken<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:52.290> yet

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
works it hasn't broken off yet

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.029 
works it hasn't broken off yet
might<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.750> oil<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.799> something

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
might have to get some oil or something

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.219 
might have to get some oil or something
to<00:01:56.630> cover<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:59.119> bright<00:02:00.119> spot<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:01.140> I've

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to cover up this bright spot where I've

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.200 
to cover up this bright spot where I've
sanded<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.909> feels<00:02:03.090> okay<00:02:05.119> at<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
sanded it but it feels okay at the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
sanded it but it feels okay at the
moment<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.569> only<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.899> 3<00:02:07.229> treble<00:02:07.710> strings

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
moment I only have 3 treble strings

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.380 
moment I only have 3 treble strings
springs<00:02:09.000> which<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.200> taped<00:02:10.739> down<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
springs which I have them taped down to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.780 
springs which I have them taped down to
keep<00:02:12.569> them<00:02:12.599> from<00:02:12.810> vibrating<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.069> resonating

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
keep them from vibrating and resonating

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.410 
keep them from vibrating and resonating
when<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.030> playing<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.510> usually<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:16.680> five

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
when I'm playing I usually use five

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.170 
when I'm playing I usually use five
because<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.840> travel<00:02:19.019> really<00:02:19.440> stiff

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
because I like to travel really stiff

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.880 
because I like to travel really stiff
but<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.239> don't<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.080> any<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.440> springs<00:02:22.709> right

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
but I don't have any more springs right

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.850 
but I don't have any more springs right
now<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.540> seems<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> work<00:02:25.049> out<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:25.739> well

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
now so it seems to work out pretty well

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.009 
now so it seems to work out pretty well
my<00:02:26.579> um<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.739> mean<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.890> guitar<00:02:29.790> did<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:30.720> come

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
my um I mean this guitar did not come

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.069 
my um I mean this guitar did not come
with<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.410> tremolo<00:02:31.980> arm<00:02:32.690> which<00:02:33.690> I'm<00:02:33.870> just

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
with the tremolo arm which I'm just

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.069 
with the tremolo arm which I'm just
gonna<00:02:34.700> order<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:36.030> eBay<00:02:36.360> or<00:02:36.900> something<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
gonna order on eBay or something and

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.800 
gonna order on eBay or something and
yeah<00:02:40.079> i<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.860> guitar<00:02:41.130> looks<00:02:41.810> pretty

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
yeah i think the guitar looks pretty

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.180 
yeah i think the guitar looks pretty
sweet<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:45.510> might<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.989> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
sweet it might be kind of like a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.319 
sweet it might be kind of like a
