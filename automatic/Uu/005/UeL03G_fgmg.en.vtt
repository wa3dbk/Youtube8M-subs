00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.210
 to the boat we decided to do it not for lack 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.520
 of tuning you know that for lack of 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.100
 identity I noticed he was laying 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.200
 very much very much why not all one 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.620
 voted because part of you jumped missed your 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.980
 soul missed what you wanted to say by 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.980
 not that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.830
 Simon to Simon to this black marriage 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 they were running me live if mother welcome 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.610
 because that 's really loose I'm telling you 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.950
 that I want to hear you first like 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.530
 another song to see what such developments 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.030
 but it 's very loose I had the vote if I 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.070
 I want to listen I wanted to hear you to 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.720
 is no longer going to be able to but it is very 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.430
 Loose is very shy or very well be that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.210
 they can hardly follow much more in your 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.950
 home but 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.830
 what a shame lacked strength has returned a lot 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.830
 more delivery in fight in next 2 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.830
 and of course 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.560
 simone congratulations for being here to see 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.500
 I'll tell you a little bit about what happens to me 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.750
 I think you have a very beautiful voice 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.750
 like your voice , however, I think 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:53.299
 but I'm also going to tell you I do not think 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:00.470
 difference from them I do not think that for 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:02.840
 nothing eye I do not think it does not loosen is a 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.360
 person who enters tim and sure not 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.450
 The whole voice is inside, not me, not 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.230
 I think it 's the song I would not put you on 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.850
 I would put the term loose never but 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.160
 I think there's a lot to work on 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.320
 everything if I agree with beatriz 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.840
 in seeking an identity for all 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.460
 I'm not saying that you do not have a voice that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.070
 can offer us something but I think there 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.680
 that I do not work it I told the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.560
 your voice is very nice the proposal was 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.560
 the one that we achieved this 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.710
 no no no 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.020
 forward yes 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.169

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.169
