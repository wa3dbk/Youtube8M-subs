it's<00:00:32.690> a<00:00:32.840> remarkably<00:00:33.530> small<00:00:33.680> amount<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:35.380> power

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
it's a remarkably small amount of power

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.970

input<00:00:37.300> if<00:00:38.300> you<00:00:38.480> just<00:00:38.720> then<00:00:38.990> going

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.110 

I<00:00:44.070> call<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> nodding<00:00:45.570> donkey<00:00:47.120> articulated

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I call it the nodding donkey articulated

I call it the nodding donkey articulated
stay<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:50.180> little<00:00:51.180> dry<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.360 

see<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.550> motors<00:00:58.880> disconnected<00:01:00.130> there's<00:01:01.130> my

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
see that motors disconnected there's my

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.900 
see that motors disconnected there's my
my<00:01:01.670> little<00:01:02.120> string<00:01:02.750> right<00:01:03.080> there<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:07.160> is<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
my little string right there this is the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.960 
my little string right there this is the
whole<00:01:08.090> thing<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.690> just<00:01:09.460> nodding<00:01:10.460> right<00:01:10.700> along

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
whole thing is just nodding right along

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.450 
whole thing is just nodding right along
it's<00:01:11.330> slowing<00:01:11.600> down<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.900> little<00:01:12.110> bit<00:01:12.320> as<00:01:13.220> you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's slowing down a little bit as you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:29.540 
it's slowing down a little bit as you
can<00:01:13.640> see<00:01:13.880> will<00:01:14.240> pump<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> up<00:01:15.260> just<00:01:15.440> a<00:01:15.620> hair<00:01:15.650> here

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.790 

but<00:01:30.150> stator<00:01:30.480> is<00:01:30.690> coming<00:01:31.050> down<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.530> behind

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
but stator is coming down just behind

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.740 
but stator is coming down just behind
that<00:01:31.980> stack<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.580> three<00:01:32.700> magnets<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.510> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that stack of three magnets there and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
that stack of three magnets there and
pushing<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> along<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.090> it's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
pushing it along and it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.320 
pushing it along and it's
counterweighted<00:01:36.690> as<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:38.120> it's<00:01:39.120> also

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
counterweighted as you can see it's also

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.330 
counterweighted as you can see it's also

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
kind of a gravity assist drive that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:56.279 
kind of a gravity assist drive that
sucker<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:45.830> crank<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:46.980> up<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.640> bit

this<00:02:00.100> arrangement<00:02:00.430> almost<00:02:01.149> works<00:02:01.450> better

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
this arrangement almost works better

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.980 
this arrangement almost works better
than<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:03.340> about<00:02:03.490> any<00:02:03.820> other<00:02:03.939> as<00:02:04.329> I've<00:02:04.659> seen

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
than just about any other as I've seen

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.920 
than just about any other as I've seen
almost<00:02:05.500> working<00:02:06.659> watch<00:02:07.659> this<00:02:12.569> these<00:02:13.569> self

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
almost working watch this these self

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.509 
almost working watch this these self
start<00:02:14.319> lunch<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.099> get<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.280> into

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
start lunch will just get it into

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.910 
start lunch will just get it into
position<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:24.220> there

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
position just like that right there

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.010 
position just like that right there
now<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.069> just<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.489> take<00:02:27.640> my<00:02:27.819> hand<00:02:28.060> away

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.730 

we<00:02:33.880> get<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.090> kick<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.690> that's<00:02:36.470> something

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
we get that kick and that's something

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.380 
we get that kick and that's something
that<00:02:37.270> will<00:02:38.270> do<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.570> again<00:02:42.370> right<00:02:43.370> zone<00:02:43.820> right

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that will do that again right zone right

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.899 
that will do that again right zone right
there

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.750 

you<00:02:53.909> look<00:02:54.750> at<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.989> sucker<00:02:55.319> go<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.459> then<00:02:56.640> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you look at that sucker go and then it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.110 
you look at that sucker go and then it
just<00:02:56.909> takes<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.689> miniscule<00:02:58.530> amount<00:02:59.120> of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just takes just a miniscule amount of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.330 
just takes just a miniscule amount of
training<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.909> thing<00:03:03.180> around<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:05.220> can

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
training like that thing around you can

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:28.360 
training like that thing around you can
see<00:03:05.579> how<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.939> of<00:03:06.150> them<00:03:06.239> push<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:04:36.480 

I<00:03:28.459> thought<00:03:29.180> me<00:03:29.330> almost<00:03:29.690> runs<00:03:30.019> doesn't<00:03:30.470> it

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.370 

I<00:04:36.580> hope<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.389> makes<00:04:37.539> it<00:04:37.660> around<00:04:37.840> this<00:04:38.080> time

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
I hope it makes it around this time

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
I hope it makes it around this time
we'll<00:04:38.680> all<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:39.069> rich<00:04:39.690> where<00:04:40.690> could<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.110> go<00:04:41.400> my

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
we'll all be rich where could it go my

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
we'll all be rich where could it go my
god<00:04:43.680> yes<00:04:44.680> sir<00:04:45.009> come<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:45.789> now<00:04:46.000> one<00:04:46.210> more<00:04:46.389> time<00:04:46.630> oh

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
god yes sir come on now one more time oh

00:04:46.990 --> 00:05:02.899 
god yes sir come on now one more time oh
I<00:04:47.800> don't<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:50.009> darn<00:04:51.009> it

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:11.629 

almost<00:05:03.749> the<00:05:04.050> way

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.210 

why<00:05:12.210> just<00:05:12.539> put<00:05:12.750> another<00:05:13.080> state<00:05:13.470> or<00:05:13.620> two<00:05:14.009> on

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
why just put another state or two on

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.010 
why just put another state or two on
there<00:05:14.520> another<00:05:14.970> couple<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.509> groups<00:05:15.780> of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
there another couple of groups of

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.260 
there another couple of groups of
magnets<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.919> puppies<00:05:17.400> be<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.939> answer

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
magnets and that puppies be the answer

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.379 
magnets and that puppies be the answer
to<00:05:18.710> save<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.009> world<00:05:20.189> from<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.879> tyranny<00:05:21.180> of

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
to save the world from the tyranny of

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.209 
to save the world from the tyranny of
Big<00:05:21.810> Oil<00:05:22.199> I<00:05:23.780> just<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.379> never<00:05:25.680> thought<00:05:26.069> it

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
Big Oil I just think I never thought it

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.999 
Big Oil I just think I never thought it
would<00:05:26.340> work<00:05:30.289> there's<00:05:31.289> that<00:05:31.469> Oh<00:05:31.500> repol

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
would work there's that Oh repol

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.589 
would work there's that Oh repol
traction<00:05:32.520> happening<00:05:32.909> right<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.240> there<00:05:33.419> you

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
traction happening right in there you

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.040 
traction happening right in there you
see<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:34.610> that's<00:05:35.610> repol<00:05:36.060> traction<00:05:38.930> when<00:05:39.930> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
see that that's repol traction when the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.020 
see that that's repol traction when the
retrack<00:05:40.439> potion<00:05:40.889> takes<00:05:41.129> over<00:05:41.400> from<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.699> repol

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
retrack potion takes over from the repol

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.879 
retrack potion takes over from the repol
traction<00:05:42.509> you<00:05:42.689> know<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.199> got<00:05:43.530> something

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
traction you know you got something

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.370 
traction you know you got something
going<00:05:44.009> on

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.200 

I'll<00:05:50.800> just<00:05:50.980> keep<00:05:51.160> doing<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:51.610> for<00:05:51.850> a<00:05:51.880> while

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.960 

all<00:05:56.780> right<00:05:57.289> that's<00:05:57.770> articulated<00:05:58.280> stator

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
all right that's articulated stator

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.789 
all right that's articulated stator
overhead<00:06:00.460> almost<00:06:01.460> works
