00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.850
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.580
 we'll see how to peel a 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 head of garlic in record time with a 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 magic tool it's a 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.270
 and more darling silicone so in a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.029
 first time we will peel separate 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.210
 at least cloves of garlic from the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210
 head 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:43.400
 here but then we go there never 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.400
 the clove of garlic in the small cube 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.350
 so it comes out perfectly peeled 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.900
 for quite round it's a little bit 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's complicated but I still 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:23.840
 very strong 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.440
 I normally have more than one 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 good arioli
