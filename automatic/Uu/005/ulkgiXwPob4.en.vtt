like you need to pick it up you can go
ahead<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.010> sometimes<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> really

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
ahead because sometimes it's really

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
ahead because sometimes it's really
important<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:43.020> fill<00:00:43.230> things<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
good feel for it before you draw it but

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.069 
good feel for it before you draw it but
um<00:00:46.700> most<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.090> though<00:00:48.329> once<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
be able to look at it without having to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.779 
be able to look at it without having to
pick<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.320> anything<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.829> anyway<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.520> how

would you how how would you start going
about<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.770> drawing<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.250> well<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
about by drawing this well here we go so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
about by drawing this well here we go so
this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.770> oh<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.699> way

this is what you do first oh by the way

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
this is what you do first oh by the way
I<00:00:59.910> did<00:01:00.300> trace<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> could

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
I did trace this out just so I could

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
I did trace this out just so I could
explain<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.699> guys<00:01:02.879> better<00:01:03.090> without

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
explain to you guys better without

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.190 
explain to you guys better without
having<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.960> try<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:05.990> come<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
having to try to come up with a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.330 
having to try to come up with a
different<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.680> showing<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> cuz<00:01:08.220> it's

different way for showing you cuz it's
probably<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> easiest<00:01:08.909> way<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
probably the easiest way to actually

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
probably the easiest way to actually
show<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> guys<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.560> talking<00:01:10.830> about

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.249 
there at the bottom on the left hand
side<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.000> shot<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
side that I just shot that that I just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.850 
side that I just shot that that I just
shooting<00:01:34.770> straight<00:01:34.860> across<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:36.780> line<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
shooting straight across that line is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.520 
shooting straight across that line is
actually<00:01:38.250> representing<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.180> depth<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
actually representing the depth of the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
actually representing the depth of the
object<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.189> you'll<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.850> mean<00:01:41.880> more

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
object now you'll see what I mean more

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.469 
object now you'll see what I mean more
on<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> next<00:01:43.619> shot<00:01:43.820> okay<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
on on the next shot okay so now as you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.679 
on on the next shot okay so now as you
can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.320> line<00:01:46.740> has<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:47.700> been<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can see that line has actually been you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.090 
can see that line has actually been you
it's<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.140> used<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> couple<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it's being used for a couple of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's being used for a couple of
different<00:01:50.460> things<00:01:50.610> where<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.360> being<00:01:51.630> used

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
different things where one is being used

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
different things where one is being used
to<00:01:52.020> help<00:01:52.110> us<00:01:52.409> connect<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.820> establish<00:01:54.270> where

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to help us connect to establish where

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.170 
to help us connect to establish where
the<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.439> bases<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.700> you'd<00:01:56.850> say<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the the bases like would you'd say like

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
the the bases like would you'd say like
the<00:01:57.329> floor<00:01:57.630> oh<00:01:58.170> yeah<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> base<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.130> basically

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the floor oh yeah the base the basically

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.600 
the floor oh yeah the base the basically
object<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.409> moving<00:02:01.710> or

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
object so as you can see it's moving or

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
object so as you can see it's moving or
it's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> shoot<00:02:03.600> across<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.049> we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's going to shoot across and then we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's going to shoot across and then we
have<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> other<00:02:04.439> line<00:02:05.270> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> cutting

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
have the other line going to cutting

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.359 
have the other line going to cutting
over<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> right<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.770> cutting<00:02:08.099> back

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
over to the right and then cutting back

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
over to the right and then cutting back
down<00:02:08.670> towards<00:02:09.270> us<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.929> actually

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
down towards us so that's actually

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.180 
down towards us so that's actually
making

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
making

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.500 
making
the<00:02:12.020> base<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.560> for<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> object<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the base for for the object and then the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
the base for for the object and then the
other<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.560> over<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
other one that you see over there on the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.410 
other one that you see over there on the
far<00:02:19.490> what's<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> left<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.270> left

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
far what's on the left it's on the left

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.360 
far what's on the left it's on the left
side<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> ones<00:02:22.620> connect<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.100> from<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
side but the ones connect you from the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.590 
side but the ones connect you from the
that's<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.880> from<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> top<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.510> bottom

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that's going from the top to the bottom

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.370 
that's going from the top to the bottom
that<00:02:25.380> right<00:02:25.710> there<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.900> establishing<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that right there is establishing the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.490 
that right there is establishing the
curve<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.850> two<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.630> our<00:02:30.930> object<00:02:31.350> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
curve the two that we have our object so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.030 
curve the two that we have our object so
that's<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.070> curve<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.490> have<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:34.040> we

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that's the curve that we have so now we

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.320 
that's the curve that we have so now we
keep<00:02:35.250> going<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.820> add<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.180> other

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
keep going on that you add the other

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.940 
keep going on that you add the other
curve<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.620> actually

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
curve in and now you can see we actually

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.100 
curve in and now you can see we actually
have<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> three-dimensional<00:02:38.750> kind<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.840> like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
have a three-dimensional kind of like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.520 
have a three-dimensional kind of like
well<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.420> three-dimensional<00:02:42.420> lining<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.960> our

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
well the three-dimensional lining of our

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.250 
well the three-dimensional lining of our
vase<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.930> imagine

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
vase so you have kind of have to imagine

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.130 
vase so you have kind of have to imagine
that<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.130> or<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.820> imagine<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.990> had

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that that is or you imagine if you had

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
that that is or you imagine if you had
if<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.920> well<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> bad<00:02:50.730> example<00:02:50.850> it's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
if you that well not a bad example it's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390 
if you that well not a bad example it's
good<00:02:51.300> example<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.170> whatever<00:02:52.440> imagine

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
good example but just whatever imagine

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.590 
good example but just whatever imagine
if<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.550> had<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.880> x-ray<00:02:54.240> vision<00:02:54.270> or

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
if you had like x-ray vision or

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.380 
if you had like x-ray vision or
something<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.410> able<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.710> see

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
something and you're just able to see

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.120 
something and you're just able to see
see<00:02:57.390> through<00:02:57.660> an<00:02:57.750> object<00:02:57.930> that's<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:58.950> kind

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
see through an object that's just kind

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.150 
see through an object that's just kind
of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.340> way<00:02:59.370> you're<00:02:59.580> gonna<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.970> try<00:03:00.150> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
of the way you're gonna have to try to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.050 
of the way you're gonna have to try to
you<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.250> practice<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.820> takes<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.030> while

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
you know practice and it takes a while

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.660 
you know practice and it takes a while
to<00:03:03.240> get<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.960> get<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.680> view<00:03:05.100> or

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to get that to get that that view or

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
to get that to get that that view or
whatever<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.150> that's<00:03:06.390> something<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.810> try<00:03:08.690> so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
whatever so that's something to try so

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.510 
whatever so that's something to try so
yeah<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> next<00:03:10.590> thing<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.980> want<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.340> is

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
yeah so the next thing you want to do is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.580 
yeah so the next thing you want to do is
if<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.910> were<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> start<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> add<00:03:13.350> this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
if you were you see I start to add this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.520 
if you were you see I start to add this
this<00:03:13.650> next<00:03:14.550> layer<00:03:14.760> on<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.600> cream<00:03:15.900> kind

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
this next layer on with the cream kind

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
sure that all of this is in

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.420 
sure that all of this is in
proportionate<00:03:37.110> with<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.440> because<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
proportionate with this because the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.490 
proportionate with this because the
distance<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.019> distance<00:03:40.170> is

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
distance is here and the distance is

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.040 
distance is here and the distance is
here<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.250> kind<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.610> it's<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.330> it's<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
here so it's kind of it's it's it's to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.290 
here so it's kind of it's it's it's to
keep<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.410> from<00:03:43.560> drawing<00:03:43.830> flat<00:03:44.340> factor<00:03:45.090> that's

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
keep you from drawing flat factor that's
