and then they have the smaller one so

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.310 
and then they have the smaller one so

girls do I did not use the hairspray at
all<00:04:02.550> because<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.959> think<00:04:04.050> with<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.060> conditioner

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
all because I think with the conditioner

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.940 
all because I think with the conditioner
that<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.360> or<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.290> leading<00:04:07.470> conditioner

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
that I or the the leading conditioner

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.070 
that I or the the leading conditioner
that<00:04:08.069> I<00:04:08.130> put<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.459> ends<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.970> think<00:04:09.900> it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
that I put on the ends I think it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.660 
that I put on the ends I think it
actually<00:04:11.299> made<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.420> curl<00:04:12.660> better<00:04:13.019> um<00:04:13.670> hence

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
actually made it curl better um hence

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.430 
actually made it curl better um hence
the<00:04:14.760> name<00:04:14.970> hairsetter<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.750> think<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
the name hairsetter I think the the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.570 
the name hairsetter I think the the
conditioner<00:04:19.440> helped<00:04:19.739> set<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.609> well<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
conditioner helped set it as well and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.060 
conditioner helped set it as well and
that<00:04:23.580> ends<00:04:24.090> even<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.540> my<00:04:24.660> curls<00:04:24.990> fall<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.680> ends

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
that ends even if my curls fall the ends

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.770 
that ends even if my curls fall the ends
will<00:04:26.220> still<00:04:26.490> be<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.639> little<00:04:27.000> bit<00:04:27.210> curled<00:04:27.570> which

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
will still be a little bit curled which

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.780

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
that's okay I can live with it for a

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.030 
that's okay I can live with it for a
couple<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:40.139> hours<00:04:40.260> right<00:04:40.710> uh<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:43.290> did<00:04:43.889> notice

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
couple of hours right uh I did notice

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.650 
couple of hours right uh I did notice
that<00:04:44.190> every<00:04:44.550> time<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:44.760> put<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.120> curl<00:04:45.330> isn't

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
that every time I put the curl isn't

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.909 
that every time I put the curl isn't
that<00:04:45.810> they<00:04:46.340> were<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.970> little<00:04:48.330> bit<00:04:48.750> hot<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.680> I

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
that they were a little bit hot like I

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.430 
that they were a little bit hot like I
would<00:04:50.039> have<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.550> put<00:04:50.760> a<00:04:51.050> piece<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.080> cotton

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
would have to put a piece of cotton

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.260 
would have to put a piece of cotton
between<00:04:53.070> my<00:04:53.250> ear<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:54.350> my<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.220> curler<00:04:56.580> so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
between my ear and my and the curler so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.360 
between my ear and my and the curler so
are<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.630> rollers<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.470> wouldn't<00:04:58.650> burn

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
are the rollers so that it wouldn't burn

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.480 
are the rollers so that it wouldn't burn
my<00:04:59.610> face<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.240> mean<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:01.260> isn't<00:05:01.500> burning<00:05:02.100> that

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
my face I mean it isn't burning that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.940 
my face I mean it isn't burning that
singe<00:05:03.090> burning<00:05:03.630> like<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.320> know<00:05:04.440> frying<00:05:04.800> your

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
singe burning like you know frying your

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.070 
singe burning like you know frying your
skin<00:05:05.310> it's<00:05:05.850> just<00:05:06.120> burning<00:05:06.389> enough<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.960> it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
skin it's just burning enough that it's

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.440 
skin it's just burning enough that it's
annoying<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.770> hurts<00:05:08.010> but<00:05:08.940> it's<00:05:09.150> nothing

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
annoying and it hurts but it's nothing

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.210 
annoying and it hurts but it's nothing
to<00:05:09.630> do<00:05:09.810> nothing<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.560> actually<00:05:10.860> burn<00:05:11.010> you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
to do nothing that can actually burn you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.159 
to do nothing that can actually burn you
otherwise<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:12.090> don't<00:05:12.150> think<00:05:12.389> they<00:05:12.510> would<00:05:12.630> you

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
otherwise I don't think they would you

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.730 
otherwise I don't think they would you
know<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.470> them<00:05:13.620> that<00:05:13.770> hot<00:05:13.950> um<00:05:15.470> there<00:05:16.470> are

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
know have them that hot um there are

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.560 
know have them that hot um there are
certain<00:05:17.190> areas<00:05:17.520> where<00:05:17.760> there<00:05:17.940> are<00:05:18.090> creases

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
certain areas where there are creases

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.700 
certain areas where there are creases
and<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:19.620> creases<00:05:20.960> if<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.080> can<00:05:22.320> catch<00:05:22.500> them

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
and the creases if you can catch them

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.589 
and the creases if you can catch them
fast<00:05:22.979> enough<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.460> can<00:05:23.700> control<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.210> creases

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
fast enough you can control the creases

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.089 
fast enough you can control the creases
that<00:05:24.630> are<00:05:24.840> created<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.349> think<00:05:25.620> it's<00:05:25.740> created<00:05:26.010> by

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
that are created I think it's created by

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.370 
that are created I think it's created by
the<00:05:26.160> by<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.760> clips<00:05:27.240> because<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> clips<00:05:28.200> are

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
the by the clips because the clips are

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.980 
the by the clips because the clips are
heated<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.770> they<00:05:29.070> have<00:05:29.190> like<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> middle

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
heated and they have like a middle

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.129 
heated and they have like a middle
inside<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.229> them<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:33.150> if<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.330> look<00:05:33.570> there's

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
inside of them so if you look there's

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.659 
inside of them so if you look there's
there's<00:05:34.889> metal<00:05:35.220> inside<00:05:36.000> of<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.539> clips<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.669> I

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
there's metal inside of the clips and I

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.850 
there's metal inside of the clips and I
think<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.300> since<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.900> clip<00:05:40.110> gets<00:05:40.320> so<00:05:40.560> hot

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
think that since the clip gets so hot

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.760 
think that since the clip gets so hot
that<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.520> edges<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.210> them<00:05:42.599> if<00:05:42.870> they<00:05:43.349> were<00:05:43.440> a

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
that the edges of them if they were a

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.339 
that the edges of them if they were a
little<00:05:44.070> bit<00:05:44.700> better<00:05:44.940> rounded<00:05:45.690> or<00:05:45.810> something

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
little bit better rounded or something

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.620 
little bit better rounded or something
they<00:05:46.770> probably<00:05:47.039> wouldn't<00:05:47.310> be<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:47.639> bad<00:05:47.820> but

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
they probably wouldn't be so bad but

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.320 
they probably wouldn't be so bad but
it's<00:05:48.780> always<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.320> demarcation<00:05:49.919> of<00:05:50.310> where<00:05:50.760> you

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
it's always the demarcation of where you

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.260 
it's always the demarcation of where you
stop<00:05:51.630> rolling<00:05:52.140> you<00:05:53.070> know<00:05:53.220> where<00:05:53.490> you're<00:05:53.669> here

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
stop rolling you know where you're here

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.159 
stop rolling you know where you're here
stop<00:05:54.659> rolling

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
stop rolling

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.459 
stop rolling
and<00:05:55.469> I've<00:05:56.310> noticed<00:05:56.819> that<00:05:56.879> if<00:05:57.060> you<00:05:57.210> use<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.629> with

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
and I've noticed that if you use it with

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.249 
and I've noticed that if you use it with
smaller<00:05:58.919> sections<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.610> hair<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.900> roller

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
smaller sections of hair the roller

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.179 
smaller sections of hair the roller
doesn't<00:06:02.159> pull<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:02.819> much<00:06:02.999> from<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.479> weight<00:06:03.689> and

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
doesn't pull so much from the weight and

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.980 
doesn't pull so much from the weight and
you<00:06:05.189> won't<00:06:05.400> get<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.759> mark<00:06:06.240> from<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:06.629> clip

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
you won't get that mark from the clip

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.670 
you won't get that mark from the clip
either<00:06:07.969> so<00:06:08.969> use<00:06:09.150> smaller<00:06:09.569> sections<00:06:10.229> but<00:06:10.560> if

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
either so use smaller sections but if

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.439 
either so use smaller sections but if
you<00:06:10.740> use<00:06:10.770> smaller<00:06:11.129> sections<00:06:11.669> you<00:06:12.180> might<00:06:12.330> have

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
you use smaller sections you might have

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.989 
you use smaller sections you might have
to<00:06:12.569> do<00:06:12.719> two<00:06:13.020> batches<00:06:13.469> of<00:06:13.650> rollers<00:06:14.279> especially

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:14.999 
to do two batches of rollers especially

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.999 
to do two batches of rollers especially
if<00:06:15.090> you<00:06:15.150> want<00:06:15.330> all<00:06:15.539> big<00:06:15.840> curls<00:06:16.169> because<00:06:16.710> the

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
if you want all big curls because the

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.040 
if you want all big curls because the
smaller<00:06:17.400> ones<00:06:17.699> i<00:06:17.879> think<00:06:17.939> the<00:06:18.539> smaller<00:06:18.779> rollers

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
smaller ones i think the smaller rollers

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.420 
smaller ones i think the smaller rollers
make<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:20.249> hair<00:06:20.520> too<00:06:20.939> tight<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.539> a<00:06:21.719> curl<00:06:22.020> and

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
make the hair too tight of a curl and

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.830 
make the hair too tight of a curl and
especially<00:06:23.430> with<00:06:23.669> shorter<00:06:24.090> well<00:06:24.360> actually

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
especially with shorter well actually

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.179 
especially with shorter well actually
with<00:06:25.169> shorter<00:06:25.499> hair<00:06:25.529> you<00:06:25.740> probably<00:06:25.979> want<00:06:26.159> to

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
with shorter hair you probably want to

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.619 
with shorter hair you probably want to
use<00:06:26.249> the<00:06:26.550> smaller<00:06:26.789> curlers<00:06:27.210> rollers<00:06:27.740> but

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
use the smaller curlers rollers but

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.730 
use the smaller curlers rollers but
anywho<00:06:30.629> if<00:06:30.779> you<00:06:30.870> just<00:06:31.110> want<00:06:31.259> the<00:06:31.289> big<00:06:31.469> curls

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
anywho if you just want the big curls

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.309 
anywho if you just want the big curls
just<00:06:32.099> use<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.490> larger<00:06:33.020> rulers<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.289> then<00:06:35.210> put

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
just use the larger rulers and then put

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.709 
just use the larger rulers and then put
the<00:06:37.319> rollers<00:06:37.919> once<00:06:38.159> you<00:06:38.219> take<00:06:38.370> them<00:06:38.520> off<00:06:38.719> put

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:39.719 
the rollers once you take them off put

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.769 
the rollers once you take them off put
them<00:06:39.779> back<00:06:40.139> inside<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.979> the<00:06:41.819> machine<00:06:42.449> and

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
them back inside of the the machine and

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.450 
them back inside of the the machine and
it<00:06:43.229> will<00:06:43.439> heat<00:06:43.889> up<00:06:44.330> again<00:06:46.129> which<00:06:47.129> takes<00:06:47.370> a

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
it will heat up again which takes a

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.040 
it will heat up again which takes a
little<00:06:47.580> bit<00:06:47.729> longer<00:06:47.939> than<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.240> first<00:06:48.479> heat<00:06:48.900> up

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
little bit longer than the first heat up

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.839 
little bit longer than the first heat up
for<00:06:49.319> some<00:06:49.469> reason<00:06:49.830> I<00:06:49.979> don't<00:06:50.279> know<00:06:50.339> if<00:06:50.490> it<00:06:50.610> stops

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
for some reason I don't know if it stops

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.339 
for some reason I don't know if it stops
heating<00:06:51.210> up<00:06:51.330> because<00:06:51.419> the<00:06:51.659> other<00:06:51.779> rollers<00:06:52.139> are

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
heating up because the other rollers are

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.320 
heating up because the other rollers are
in<00:06:52.469> there<00:06:52.680> or<00:06:53.069> what<00:06:53.749> but<00:06:55.159> yeah<00:06:56.159> captain<00:06:56.699> wait

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
in there or what but yeah captain wait

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.350 
in there or what but yeah captain wait
another<00:06:58.259> like<00:06:58.680> four<00:06:58.949> or<00:06:59.009> five<00:06:59.069> minutes<00:06:59.610> and

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
another like four or five minutes and

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.499 
another like four or five minutes and
then<00:07:00.449> you<00:07:00.719> just<00:07:00.899> um<00:07:01.169> put<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.860> ten<00:07:02.759> back<00:07:03.330> in

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
then you just um put the ten back in

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:04.879 
then you just um put the ten back in
your<00:07:03.629> hair<00:07:03.810> wherever<00:07:04.050> you<00:07:04.259> whatever<00:07:04.560> here<00:07:04.770> you

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
your hair wherever you whatever here you

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.300 
your hair wherever you whatever here you
have<00:07:05.009> left<00:07:06.710> trying<00:07:07.710> to<00:07:07.800> make<00:07:07.919> sure<00:07:08.069> I<00:07:08.099> didn't

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
have left trying to make sure I didn't

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.969 
have left trying to make sure I didn't
forget<00:07:08.370> anything<00:07:08.759> I<00:07:10.669> think<00:07:11.669> that's<00:07:11.819> it
