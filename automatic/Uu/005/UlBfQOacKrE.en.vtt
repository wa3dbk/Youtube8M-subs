here<00:00:30.760> I'm<00:00:30.970> standing<00:00:31.480> beside<00:00:31.690> a<00:00:32.169> hot<00:00:32.650> bed<00:00:32.950> which

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
here I'm standing beside a hot bed which

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.190 
here I'm standing beside a hot bed which
is<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.570> heap<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.710> fresh<00:00:36.160> manure<00:00:37.200> generating

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
is a heap of fresh manure generating

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.820 
is a heap of fresh manure generating
heat<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.650> then<00:00:39.160> as<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.730> heat<00:00:40.030> rises<00:00:40.830> it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
heat and then as that heat rises it

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.820 
heat and then as that heat rises it
shifts<00:00:42.700> slowly<00:00:43.030> through<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.809> bed<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.230> compost

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
shifts slowly through a bed of compost

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.970 
shifts slowly through a bed of compost
which<00:00:45.040> we've<00:00:45.280> put<00:00:45.489> on<00:00:45.610> top<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:47.140> rust<00:00:47.470> the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
which we've put on top it's rust the

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.280 
which we've put on top it's rust the
heap<00:00:48.610> of<00:00:48.730> compost<00:00:49.180> it's<00:00:49.360> held<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.870> normal

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
heap of compost it's held in a normal

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.870 
heap of compost it's held in a normal
wooden<00:00:50.559> frame<00:00:50.829> just<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.160> any<00:00:51.400> raised<00:00:51.640> bed

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
wooden frame just like any raised bed

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.210 
wooden frame just like any raised bed
and<00:00:52.120> there's<00:00:52.960> six<00:00:53.140> inches<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.740> well<00:00:53.920> watered

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and there's six inches of well watered

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.850 
and there's six inches of well watered
cow<00:00:54.430> manure<00:00:54.610> my<00:00:55.060> own<00:00:55.240> compost<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:56.680> which

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
cow manure my own compost into which

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.780 
cow manure my own compost into which
I've<00:00:57.100> sown<00:00:57.340> seeds<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:58.170> planted<00:00:59.170> plants<00:00:59.560> and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
I've sown seeds and planted plants and

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.580 
I've sown seeds and planted plants and
that<00:01:00.790> was<00:01:01.270> all<00:01:01.420> done<00:01:01.600> four<00:01:01.900> weeks<00:01:02.079> ago<00:01:02.380> we

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
that was all done four weeks ago we

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.499 
that was all done four weeks ago we
assembled<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.100> heat<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.489> put<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.300> bed<00:01:04.479> on

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
assembled the heat and put the bed on

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.480 
assembled the heat and put the bed on
top<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.080> so<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.500> seeds<00:01:05.710> planted<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:06.160> plants

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
top and so the seeds planted the plants

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.230 
top and so the seeds planted the plants
within<00:01:06.759> two<00:01:07.240> or<00:01:07.270> three<00:01:07.540> days<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.130> have<00:01:09.340> heat

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
within two or three days so we have heat

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.480 
within two or three days so we have heat
roaming<00:01:11.229> these<00:01:11.350> plants<00:01:11.770> all<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.070> time<00:01:12.280> as

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
roaming these plants all the time as

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.260 
roaming these plants all the time as
they're<00:01:13.360> growing<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.649> can<00:01:14.830> see<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:16.090> are

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
second year I've made hot bed since last

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.520 
second year I've made hot bed since last
year<00:01:37.299> was<00:01:37.390> very<00:01:37.420> cold<00:01:37.780> spring<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.229> was<00:01:38.290> just

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
right this year it's been a mild spring

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.719 
right this year it's been a mild spring
and<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.810> bit<00:01:40.930> too<00:01:41.080> warm<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:42.100> this

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729

the<00:02:54.760> fresh<00:02:55.660> manure<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.010> heat<00:02:57.250> from

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the fresh manure and then the heat from

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
the fresh manure and then the heat from
the<00:02:57.640> manure<00:02:57.880> gently<00:02:58.330> rises<00:02:58.720> up<00:02:58.900> through<00:02:59.020> all

the manure gently rises up through all

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.560 
the manure gently rises up through all
the<00:02:59.950> seedlings<00:03:00.459> which<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.270> this

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the seedlings which I have on this

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.780 
the seedlings which I have on this
pallet<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.860> heat<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.190> helping<00:03:03.490> them<00:03:03.640> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
pallet and the heat is helping them to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
pallet and the heat is helping them to
germinate<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.570> grow<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.990> winter<00:03:05.590> time<00:03:05.890> and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
germinate and to grow in winter time and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.320 
germinate and to grow in winter time and
although<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.110> manure<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.680> now<00:03:08.950> two<00:03:09.640> months

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
although this manure is now two months

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.229 
although this manure is now two months
old<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.709> thermometer<00:03:12.220> one<00:03:12.459> foot<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.970> is

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
old this thermometer one foot in is

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.890 
old this thermometer one foot in is
showing<00:03:13.600> 40<00:03:14.050> degrees<00:03:14.380> still<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:16.000> over<00:03:16.540> 100

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
showing 40 degrees still that's over 100

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.340 
showing 40 degrees still that's over 100
Fahrenheit<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:19.239> an<00:03:19.480> oppressive<00:03:19.989> amount

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
Fahrenheit so it's an oppressive amount
