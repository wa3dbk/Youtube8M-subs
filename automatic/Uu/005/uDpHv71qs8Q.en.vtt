00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
hi there my name is Adam from ascent

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.560 
hi there my name is Adam from ascent
data<00:00:12.260> cabling<00:00:12.740> and<00:00:12.890> in<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:13.580> video<00:00:13.880> I'm<00:00:14.360> going

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
data cabling and in this video I'm going

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.530 
data cabling and in this video I'm going
to<00:00:14.660> talk<00:00:14.809> about<00:00:14.840> ADSL<00:00:15.559> filters<00:00:16.300> why<00:00:17.300> do<00:00:17.360> we

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
to talk about ADSL filters why do we

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.510 
to talk about ADSL filters why do we
need<00:00:17.720> them<00:00:17.900> what<00:00:18.349> do<00:00:18.470> they<00:00:18.590> look<00:00:18.740> like<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.250> how

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
need them what do they look like and how

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.210 
need them what do they look like and how
do<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.700> use<00:00:19.939> them<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:21.380> let's<00:00:21.560> start<00:00:21.800> with<00:00:21.920> why<00:00:22.070> we

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
do I use them so let's start with why we

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.940 
do I use them so let's start with why we
need<00:00:22.369> them<00:00:22.580> now<00:00:23.420> your<00:00:23.540> DSL<00:00:24.050> signal<00:00:24.290> travels

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
need them now your DSL signal travels

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.010 
need them now your DSL signal travels
down<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.220> same<00:00:25.730> copper<00:00:26.270> wire<00:00:26.539> as<00:00:26.810> your

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
down the same copper wire as your

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.740 
down the same copper wire as your
telephone<00:00:27.440> signal<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:29.029> problems<00:00:29.449> arise

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
telephone signal the problems arise

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.650 
telephone signal the problems arise
because<00:00:30.190> ADSL<00:00:31.190> is<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.369> much<00:00:31.699> higher<00:00:32.000> frequency

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
because ADSL is a much higher frequency

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.479 
because ADSL is a much higher frequency
signal<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:33.650> can<00:00:33.800> interfere<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.280> your

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
signal and this can interfere with your

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.030 
signal and this can interfere with your
telephone<00:00:34.910> line<00:00:35.170> you'll<00:00:36.170> notice<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:36.590> mostly

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
telephone line you'll notice this mostly

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.460 
telephone line you'll notice this mostly
as<00:00:37.160> noise<00:00:37.430> static<00:00:38.059> pips<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.780> squeaks<00:00:39.260> that

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
as noise static pips and squeaks that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.930 
as noise static pips and squeaks that
you<00:00:39.559> hear<00:00:39.830> when<00:00:40.250> you're<00:00:40.400> making<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.670> telephone

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
you hear when you're making a telephone

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.170 
you hear when you're making a telephone
call<00:00:41.470> so<00:00:42.470> an<00:00:42.559> ADSL<00:00:42.949> filter<00:00:43.370> will<00:00:43.610> remove<00:00:43.640> those

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
call so an ADSL filter will remove those

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.640 
call so an ADSL filter will remove those
and<00:00:44.510> make<00:00:44.720> your<00:00:44.900> telephone<00:00:45.350> sound

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
and make your telephone sound

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.700 
and make your telephone sound
crystal-clear<00:00:46.510> now<00:00:47.510> there<00:00:47.720> are<00:00:47.809> two<00:00:48.049> types<00:00:48.470> of

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
crystal-clear now there are two types of

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.789 
crystal-clear now there are two types of
dsl<00:00:49.280> filter<00:00:49.309> there<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.960> inline<00:00:51.379> filter

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
dsl filter there is the inline filter

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.039 
dsl filter there is the inline filter
which<00:00:52.100> looks<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:52.549> this<00:00:52.790> and<00:00:53.059> these<00:00:53.690> are<00:00:53.900> ones

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
which looks like this and these are ones

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.170 
which looks like this and these are ones
that<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.260> can<00:00:54.350> use<00:00:54.650> yourselves<00:00:55.220> there<00:00:56.030> are

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
that you can use yourselves there are

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.210 
that you can use yourselves there are
then<00:00:56.299> also<00:00:56.540> central<00:00:57.350> filters<00:00:57.680> which<00:00:58.040> look

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
then also central filters which look

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.579 
then also central filters which look
like<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.970> these<00:00:59.540> must<00:00:59.839> be<00:00:59.930> installed<00:01:00.379> by

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
like this and these must be installed by

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.880 
like this and these must be installed by
qualified<00:01:01.070> technician<00:01:02.290> there<00:01:03.290> are<00:01:03.409> two<00:01:03.530> types

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
qualified technician there are two types

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.730 
qualified technician there are two types
of<00:01:04.100> inline<00:01:04.460> filter<00:01:04.990> this<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> standard

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
of inline filter this is the standard

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.789 
of inline filter this is the standard

telephone which is filtered and removes

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.849 
telephone which is filtered and removes
the<00:01:31.759> noise<00:01:31.939> again<00:01:32.929> you'll<00:01:33.289> notice<00:01:33.469> they're

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
the noise again you'll notice they're

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.690 
the noise again you'll notice they're
the<00:01:33.979> same<00:01:34.219> types<00:01:34.549> of<00:01:34.700> socket<00:01:36.100> now<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:37.549> might

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the same types of socket now there might

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.700 
the same types of socket now there might
be<00:01:37.759> times<00:01:38.119> when<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.509> need<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:38.899> central<00:01:39.469> filter

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
be times when you need a central filter

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.190 
be times when you need a central filter
most<00:01:40.609> commonly<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.240> occurs<00:01:41.600> when<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.170> have

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
most commonly this occurs when you have

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.179 
most commonly this occurs when you have
a<00:01:42.710> security<00:01:43.549> system<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:45.289> need<00:01:45.499> to<00:01:45.710> filter<00:01:45.950> out

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
a security system you need to filter out

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.130 
a security system you need to filter out
the<00:01:46.369> noise<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.060> DSL<00:01:47.420> noise<00:01:47.600> from<00:01:47.990> your

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the noise the DSL noise from your

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.289 
the noise the DSL noise from your
security<00:01:48.439> system<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:49.789> get<00:01:50.060> one<00:01:50.210> of

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
security system and so you get one of

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.800 
security system and so you get one of
these<00:01:50.420> installed<00:01:51.369> when<00:01:52.369> we<00:01:52.460> look<00:01:52.609> inside

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
these installed when we look inside

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.969 
these installed when we look inside
you'll<00:01:53.810> see<00:01:53.960> there's<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.200> bunch<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.469> connectors

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
you'll see there's a bunch of connectors

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.910 
you'll see there's a bunch of connectors
and<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:56.450> do<00:01:56.600> need<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> special<00:01:57.229> tool<00:01:57.259> to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
and you do need a special tool to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.429 
and you do need a special tool to
install<00:01:58.280> these<00:01:58.719> but<00:01:59.719> essentially<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.289> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
install these but essentially it is the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.489 
install these but essentially it is the
same<00:02:00.679> one<00:02:01.249> line<00:02:01.460> comes<00:02:01.819> in<00:02:02.030> two<00:02:02.869> lines<00:02:03.140> come

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
same one line comes in two lines come

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.370 
same one line comes in two lines come
out<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.850> unfiltered<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.780> goes<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
out one is unfiltered and goes to the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.749 
out one is unfiltered and goes to the
socket<00:02:06.590> where<00:02:06.859> your<00:02:06.979> modem<00:02:07.280> will<00:02:07.429> be<00:02:07.520> plugged
