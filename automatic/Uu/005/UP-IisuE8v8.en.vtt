we're gonna show you simple mod and how
to<00:00:16.170> modify<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.590> Mobius<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.609> use<00:00:17.699> an

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to modify your Mobius so you can use an

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.310 
to modify your Mobius so you can use an
external<00:00:17.850> battery<00:00:18.210> checker<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.869> check<00:00:19.199> your

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
external battery checker to check your

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.609 
external battery checker to check your
voltage<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:20.550> gonna<00:00:20.789> take<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.970> apart<00:00:21.619> there

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
voltage I'm gonna take it apart there

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.689 
voltage I'm gonna take it apart there
are<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.769> screws<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:23.400> gonna<00:00:23.550> take

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
are two screws right here I'm gonna take

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.070 
are two screws right here I'm gonna take
these<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:27.170> I'm<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> lipo<00:00:28.800> out

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
these out I'm gonna take the lipo out

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.659 
these out I'm gonna take the lipo out
I'm<00:00:31.080> gonna<00:00:31.199> plug<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> those<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.520> there's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I'm gonna plug that those like there's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.430 
I'm gonna plug that those like there's
two<00:00:32.790> pads<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> our<00:00:33.960> jst

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
two pads in here so I'm going to our jst

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
two pads in here so I'm going to our jst
on<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> cut<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> small<00:00:35.579> hole<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> case

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
on that and cut a small hole in the case

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
on that and cut a small hole in the case
so<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.140> check<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.620> external

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
so I can just check it with an external

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 
so I can just check it with an external
battery<00:00:38.040> checker<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:39.510> remove<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> Kapton

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
battery checker just remove the Kapton

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.380 
battery checker just remove the Kapton
tape<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.760> high<00:00:41.910> temperature<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
tape this is like high temperature to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.700 
tape this is like high temperature to
take<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.629> isn't<00:00:42.870> melts<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.410> pretty<00:00:43.590> sure

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
take that isn't melts I'm pretty sure

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.029 
take that isn't melts I'm pretty sure
boys<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.190> warranties<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.739> I'll

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
boys all warranties so I think I'll

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
boys all warranties so I think I'll
drill<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> small<00:00:47.520> hole<00:00:48.379> or<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
drill a small hole or out the back is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.569 
drill a small hole or out the back is
good<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> drill

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.529 

that<00:00:56.579> would<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> hole<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.180> where

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that would be the hole right there where

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.670 
that would be the hole right there where
this<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.840> comes<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.199> a<00:01:00.530> neat<00:01:01.530> thing<00:01:01.649> about

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this water comes out a neat thing about

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
this water comes out a neat thing about
to<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.129> wire<00:01:02.309> too<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.000> grab<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to look on wire too if you grab and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
to look on wire too if you grab and
pinch<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.750> fingernail<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> rip<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
pinch with your fingernail and rip it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
pinch with your fingernail and rip it
you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.280> strip<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.810> take<00:01:06.810> an<00:01:06.900> easy<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you can strip it take an easy way to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
you can strip it take an easy way to
strip<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> without<00:01:08.040> pulling<00:01:08.220> any<00:01:08.490> strands

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
strip this without pulling any strands

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
strip this without pulling any strands
of<00:01:08.820> wire<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.260> okay<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.770> we've

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of wire around okay so now that we've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.039 
of wire around okay so now that we've
gotten<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.400> battery<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> connector

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
gotten the battery off and the connector

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.050 
gotten the battery off and the connector
all<00:01:13.200> prepped<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.610> solder<00:01:14.790> do

case I'm sorry that back on comes in
take<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> Kapton<00:01:25.439> tape<00:01:25.500> stick<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> back<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
take the Kapton tape stick it back on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:37.010 
take the Kapton tape stick it back on
flip<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> over<00:01:29.009> where<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.030> found<00:01:30.210> it

bottom of the display you notice the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520 
bottom of the display you notice the
dots<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.400> like<00:01:45.520> 4.2<00:01:46.390> it'll<00:01:46.750> be<00:01:46.870> four<00:01:47.230> or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
dots for like 4.2 it'll be four or

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.190 
dots for like 4.2 it'll be four or

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
yourself so cell one cell to cell 3 cell

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.320 
yourself so cell one cell to cell 3 cell
phone<00:02:05.320> 5<00:02:05.619> 6<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.850> on<00:02:06.880> when<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.149> use<00:02:07.300> a
