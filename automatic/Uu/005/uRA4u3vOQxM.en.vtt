had to do some creative touching up to
fix<00:03:27.970> up<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.209> mistake<00:03:28.480> basically<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.290> put<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
fix up the mistake basically you put the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.890 
fix up the mistake basically you put the
yellow<00:03:29.769> dial<00:03:30.100> down<00:03:30.280> first<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.660> do

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
yellow dial down first then you do

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.500 
yellow dial down first then you do
everything<00:03:32.320> else<00:03:32.470> don't<00:03:33.220> bother<00:03:33.459> having<00:03:34.390> a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
everything else don't bother having a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.000 
everything else don't bother having a
break<00:03:34.690> from<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> yellow<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.380> mix<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.769> another

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
break from the yellow and mix in another

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.600 
break from the yellow and mix in another
car<00:03:36.250> you've<00:03:36.940> gotta<00:03:37.239> do<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.630> yellow<00:03:38.459> trust<00:03:39.459> me

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
car you've gotta do the yellow trust me

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.860 
car you've gotta do the yellow trust me
you<00:03:40.030> need<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> do<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:41.850> some<00:03:42.850> other<00:03:42.880> decals<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you need to do it some other decals I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
you need to do it some other decals I
think<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.709> some<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.010> decals<00:03:45.310> are<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.489> bit

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
think that some of the decals are a bit

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.810 
think that some of the decals are a bit
too<00:03:45.970> big<00:03:46.650> I've<00:03:47.650> actually<00:03:47.920> had<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> touch<00:03:48.580> up

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
too big I've actually had to touch up

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.330 
too big I've actually had to touch up
quite<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> few<00:03:49.510> decals<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.890> we<00:03:51.010> start<00:03:51.220> some

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
quite a few decals and we start some

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
quite a few decals and we start some
customer<00:03:51.700> yellow<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.330> match<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.810> paint<00:03:53.019> our

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
customer yellow to match the paint our

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.229 
customer yellow to match the paint our
decals<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:54.370> touch<00:03:54.550> up<00:03:54.730> where<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:54.940> decals

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
decals to touch up where the decals

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.780 
decals to touch up where the decals
didn't<00:03:55.510> cover<00:03:55.690> properly<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.530> redid<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.400> base

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
didn't cover properly and redid the base

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.810 
didn't cover properly and redid the base
color<00:03:58.200> again<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.350> touch<00:03:59.560> up<00:03:59.769> where<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
color again to touch up where so the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.150 
color again to touch up where so the
yellow<00:04:01.060> decals<00:04:01.480> were<00:04:01.780> too<00:04:02.140> big<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:03.070> they

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
yellow decals were too big I think they

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.300 
yellow decals were too big I think they
are<00:04:03.190> too<00:04:03.370> big

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
are too big

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.030 
are too big
a<00:04:05.540> fortune<00:04:06.540> around<00:04:06.810> time<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> will<00:04:07.620> light<00:04:07.830> of

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
a fortune around time I will light of

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.809 
a fortune around time I will light of
them<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:09.410> line<00:04:10.410> wash<00:04:10.709> over<00:04:11.099> this<00:04:11.130> just<00:04:11.700> to

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
them a line wash over this just to

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.550 
them a line wash over this just to
accentuate<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.660> lines<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:15.320> too<00:04:16.320> late<00:04:16.530> now

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
accentuate the lines but too late now

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.140 
accentuate the lines but too late now
climate<00:04:17.130> isn't<00:04:17.250> finished<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.760> might<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.120> that

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
climate isn't finished I might do that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.000 
climate isn't finished I might do that
for<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.630> future<00:04:19.019> competition<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:22.800> was<00:04:22.980> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
for a future competition this was a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.520 
for a future competition this was a
challenge<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.550> was<00:04:23.669> actually<00:04:23.820> very<00:04:24.290> close<00:04:25.290> to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
challenge I was actually very close to

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.350 
challenge I was actually very close to
saying<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.280> can't<00:04:26.760> finish<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.330> time

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
saying that can't finish this in time

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.110 
saying that can't finish this in time
but<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:28.250> managed<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.340> finish<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.669> in<00:04:29.790> time<00:04:29.910> at

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
but it managed to finish it in time at

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.790 
but it managed to finish it in time at
