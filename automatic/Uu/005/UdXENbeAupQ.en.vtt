want to get that because that helps a
lot<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.950> arenas<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
lot I would only use it in arenas I

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.889 
lot I would only use it in arenas I
would<00:01:56.610> only<00:01:56.700> use<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.090> glyph<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:57.600> diverse

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
would only use the glyph of my diverse

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.219 
would only use the glyph of my diverse
doctoring<00:01:58.380> arenas<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.250> um<00:01:59.490> it<00:02:00.229> actually

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
doctoring arenas because um it actually

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
doctoring arenas because um it actually
it<00:02:01.759> all<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:02.880> here's<00:02:03.149> what<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> does<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it all right here's what it does it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
it all right here's what it does it
increases<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.470> health<00:02:04.649> gain<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.520> my

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
increases the health gain from my

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
increases the health gain from my
diverse<00:02:05.970> walk<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:06.299> twenty<00:02:06.750> percent<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
diverse walk by twenty percent but it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.959 
diverse walk by twenty percent but it
also<00:02:07.649> increases<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.429> cool<00:02:08.609> down<00:02:08.759> by<00:02:08.909> two

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:08.969 
also increases the cool down by two

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.059 
also increases the cool down by two
minutes<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> i<00:02:09.989> only<00:02:10.169> use<00:02:10.349> my<00:02:10.529> survive<00:02:10.829> back

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
minutes and i only use my survive back

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.090 
minutes and i only use my survive back
row<00:02:11.279> once<00:02:11.969> um<00:02:12.359> /<00:02:13.319> arena

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
row once um / arena

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.130 
row once um / arena
so<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.520> why<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:15.330> diverse<00:02:15.630> walk<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.960> good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so that's why my diverse walk is good

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
so that's why my diverse walk is good
for<00:02:16.320> arenas<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.190> battle<00:02:17.490> grounds

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
for arenas but not for battle grounds

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.370 
for arenas but not for battle grounds
because<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.150> enduring<00:02:18.810> battlegrounds

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
because you enduring battlegrounds

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.510 
because you enduring battlegrounds
you're<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.070> up<00:02:20.340> is

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you're going to want that up is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640 
you're going to want that up is
periodically<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.240> possible<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.380> um

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
periodically as possible so um

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.320 
periodically as possible so um
especially<00:02:23.490> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.730> health<00:02:24.060> stones

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
especially if you have health stones

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.670 
especially if you have health stones
because<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:24.750> more<00:02:24.900> likely<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.350> health

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
because you're more likely to health

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.770 
because you're more likely to health
stones<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.970> battleground<00:02:27.330> unless

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
stones in a in a battleground unless

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.770 
stones in a in a battleground unless
your<00:02:27.990> compt<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> rock<00:02:28.770> lock<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.880> rock<00:02:30.360> oh<00:02:30.600> my
