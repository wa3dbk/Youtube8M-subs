00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.280
 for the place of missing teeth we 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.480
 we install dental dental 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.910
 implants here they look 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.599
 represent an artificial root 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 missing tooth and on top of them in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.940
 depending on the defect we set 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 either a single crown like here 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.470
 will be here either 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
 bridge prosthesis i.e. prosthesis kk 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.400
 how am I my teeth when 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.750
 from respectively your teeth from any 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.030
 metal-ceramic material 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.560
 from new as new technology 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.340
 metalless ceramics 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 after surgery we remove 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.100
 prints your sponge plaster models 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.080
 fixed in the so-called articulator 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 this is the apparatus that represents 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 fully reproduces the movement of the bottom 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.499
 jaws relative to the upper viz 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.420
 he is also a joint 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:23.119
 so prosthetics on implants in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 this technology is absolutely accurate 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.359
 implant placement absolutely 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.039
 painlessly done under local 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:36.210
 anesthesia that is lubricated gum to 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.789
 implant injected cannot take hold 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 This foreign body should not top 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.770
 bend criterion 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.920
 his lucky 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 dice positioning is classic 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.619
 several months that is possible 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.090
 of course 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.969
 accelerated accelerated prosthetics in 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 some vital indications but in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:04.619
 the average is two months on the lower jaw 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.069
 and three months without related operations 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.769
 on top of what it is if we have defects 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.720
 dental rows on different jaws or in 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.870
 different functional areas 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.940
 mind and install separately 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 first on the top for example then on 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.130
 lower prosthesis simultaneously if 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.959
 the point you're near is definitely better 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.739
 set them under one tip 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.739
 one operation
