really wasn't thinking about the
national<00:00:48.899> championship<00:00:49.410> maybe<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.070> one

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
national championship maybe the one

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
national championship maybe the one
after<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.640> game<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> been<00:00:51.210> thinking

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
after this game would have been thinking

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.209 
after this game would have been thinking
about<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:51.860> wasn't<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.039> thinking

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
about it but wasn't really thinking

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
about it but wasn't really thinking
about<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.030> game<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.809> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
about it going into this game you think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
about it going into this game you think
this<00:00:55.199> game<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.920> gonna<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> tough

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this game was that gonna be that tough

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
this game was that gonna be that tough
to<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.260> didn't<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> think

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to where you didn't really want to think

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
to where you didn't really want to think
about<00:00:59.460> before<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.359> game<00:01:00.629> oh<00:01:00.809> yeah<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.230> knew

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about before this game oh yeah we knew

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.740 
about before this game oh yeah we knew
USC<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> come<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.940> try<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
USC was going to come out and try to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
USC was going to come out and try to
beat<00:01:03.989> us<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.710> did<00:01:04.890> today<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.909> I
