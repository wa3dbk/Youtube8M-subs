keep<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> peace<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.820> wasn't<00:01:24.210> enough<00:01:24.510> I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
keep the peace but it wasn't enough I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.440 
keep the peace but it wasn't enough I
think<00:01:26.640> there's<00:01:26.790> anything<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.240> could<00:01:27.420> have

think there's anything we could have
done<00:01:27.630> differently<00:01:29.090> maybe<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.930> accepted

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
done differently maybe if we accepted

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
done differently maybe if we accepted
sooner<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.420> world<00:01:33.420> before<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:34.320> gone<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sooner that world before was gone it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.190 
sooner that world before was gone it
