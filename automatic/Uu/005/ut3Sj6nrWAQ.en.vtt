00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
Martin is honest and we don't make

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.979 
Martin is honest and we don't make
compromises<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.459> whatever<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:41.849> do<00:02:41.999> we<00:02:42.689> have<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
compromises so whatever we do we have to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.349 
compromises so whatever we do we have to
do<00:02:43.139> right<00:02:43.349> if<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.489> do<00:02:44.609> performance<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.239> do

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
do right if we do performance we do

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.720 
do right if we do performance we do
performance<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.109> don't<00:02:46.319> downsize<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.609> we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
performance we don't downsize and if we

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.979 
performance we don't downsize and if we
do<00:02:47.849> respect<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:50.549> needs<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.909> emission<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
do respect the needs of emission and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.929 
do respect the needs of emission and
space<00:02:52.349> they're<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.609> it<00:02:53.730> without

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
space they're going to do it without
