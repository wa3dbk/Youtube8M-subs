00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 and tangerines 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 This guide is made exclusively for 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.010
 of the video maker of the mail.ru company 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 it does not contain copyright infringement 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.920
 to the game ground war tanks 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.050
 but just in case they were redone 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 original game sounds refer to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.890
 this video is ironic 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 or your code will upset the tree and eat everything 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 Tangerines welcome everyone today 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 thirty first of december and with you in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 story how important and she by name 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 video understood it will be an overview of the tank t-26 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 e5 as part of the competition therefore he is not 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 quite ordinary this american average 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 life tank sa caught my attention we 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.980
 again just try pt now 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.789
 explain the hallmark of all 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.850
 Fri-Sau 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.550
 is the general slowness lack 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 towers and in many cases still quite good 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.299
 the armor of our case is all wrong 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 the whole branch we go on is different 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.340
 very diverse machines too we 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 we get by buying t-26 and 5 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 Well, first of all it is beautiful 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.009
 dynamics is not the highest speed 46 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.060
 kilometers an hour and a powerful engine 704 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.009
 horsepower 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 which allows you to quickly dial 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.549
 maximum speed and adequately 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 I can't climb 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 praise our tower it is wide extremely 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 spins slowly 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.720
 yes even with nehily still on top however 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.509
 mask dough catches ricochet and here stands 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790
 note that sin is generally complaining because 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.430
 the presence of the tower itself is not a phenomenon 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.130
 same often on pdf 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.170
 now we have no luck to the edge 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.780
 p and has a good 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.780
 rate of fire more than normal 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.270
 breakthrough and balanced damage then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.380
 there is no imba though while you turn off 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.070
 top gun 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.020
 you will have to go through several circles of hell 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.399
 especially at first but the very first guns 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.650
 amount of experience required 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.379
 study mod for this tank at first 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 I was shocked by the ji and could not long 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.689
 recover but eventually overcame 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.090
 and pumped it in and when it is in that game 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.360
 this tank becomes extremely pleasant 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.120
 it's very cool serious about armor 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.269
 it's not worth talking to her 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.340
 no pity though this is a fee for our dynamics 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.319
 many tanks have no armor 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.409
 Yes, and in most cases, it simply does not 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.659
 helped summarizing I can say 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.840
 following this unit 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.090
 is one of the most 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.040
 balanced tanks in the game all his 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.920
 parameters brought to common denominator 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.540
 and it is a pity when you meet others 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.200
 seventh level machines 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.139
 which we are less balanced we are 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.180
 score of cars and 9 points out of 10 and hopefully 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.849
 developers will continue to add 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.639
 similar balanced and aggregates 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.920
 which is interesting to play here 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.659
 for example, have not seen a single car with 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.970
 extremely good armor and low 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.829
 mobility and rapid-fire cannon 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.109
 but it would be funny wouldn’t that fight 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.530
 not yet finished words on a piece of paper yes 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:27.340
 so it’s worth telling something 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:31.419
 useful for example my future plans 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.650
 Well, first of all, I decided to compare 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.419
 all premium cars i.e. it is 8 7 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 lower levels 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:43.419
 find out which one is better and bend over 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.730
 which one is better to farm well and that 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.060
 similar things 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.250
 you understand that without a press account 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.280
 it just does not work well 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.290
 expensive I can not pull it however 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.840
 701 and t-34 I have bought them 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.239
 squat on burst Rossi yes so their 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.299
 comparison will be very soon 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.310
 I have a small review on t34 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.769
 on the channel 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.950
 the next plan is building some 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.650
 chains of guides for winning various 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.590
 types in battle in the first place I want 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.269
 of course tell you about the defense 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.880
 Separately consider combat tactics 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.039
 on it for there is still no more or 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.850
 less down on victory instructions on 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.250
 Stalinhrad 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.830
 I personally do not have such instructions on the form 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.260
 We had some more interesting videos but 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.350
 by him understand what to do and how 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.080
 it is better to do it is simply impossible well 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.880
 seventh 8 soap or of course pick 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.280
 tactics I breathe it is far from ideal what 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.620
 talk about newbies who got into 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 first time on the defensive and they just don't 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.820
 know what to do this gap niche him 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.740
 close by the way and you never 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.220
 wondered which machines are better 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.430
 pass 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.620
 I thought about the defense but did not give it 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.700
 necessary attention and in vain 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.800
 taking for example t28 pt you get runs 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.440
 the wall is just like a rex wall 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.599
 from where this car can't get through 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.240
 most of the machines radich should and 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.340
 drove a little ahead in front of the allies you 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.760
 great probability soak a 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.190
 90 percent damage to all enemies and 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.710
 bring the most likely victory in the team 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.660
 and if you add to this for example 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.630
 several tanks with powerful guns 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.599
 for example isu-152 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.110
 then get a hellish massacre guaranteeing 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.849
 victory with coherence 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.070
 Of course, not only defense and necessary 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.500
 I would really like to follow me 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.949
 tangi of all branches 13 but I just 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.760
 not enough time and energy well, either 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.490
 just no desire for example 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.930
 pump German tyazh well then what is not 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.600
 do you want us to hurt that they just don’t 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.150
 interesting here to see what they are 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.340
 capable and all that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.340
 always please regarding application 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.270
 damage and tanking too i would 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.490
 never wanted to do 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.710
 such things when i watch that 701 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.410
 the object does not use its side as you 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.720
 know they are very strong 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.570
 although the tank itself is not very strong 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.560
 easily makes its way into the nld and turret but 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.080
 the board is something that I just adore 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.270
 tank can also absorb a lot of damage 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.970
 if you know how to use it but these 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.480
 701 objects usually do not know in 99 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:37.090
 actually percent of cases also 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.550
 tanks with good angles in the clan that wife 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.130
 I do not understand why people do not use that 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.870
 for example, the same 701 where udemy and such 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.120
 corners so you can't just 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.860
 call on the gorochka and lower the guns 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.470
 down thus getting 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.600
 predominantly by other tanks these 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.810
 people don't use it as far as 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.660
 streams, I would not do much else but 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.960
 my operator unfortunately is not this is not 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.830
 will allow explaining using 4g internet 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.440
 which is pretty fast but limited 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.930
 my case is only 50 megabytes per month 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.710
 that as you understand it is extremely small and 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.900
 absolutely unacceptable for streams and 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.980
 I want to recall something now on 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.770
 mail.ru 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.460
 there is a vote moreover they already 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.570
 ranked second and if we win I 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.830
 I really hope for it 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.700
 then the developers promised some special 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.290
 presents 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.140
 if you have not voted to do it 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:39.970
 immediately and together but maybe even 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:42.310
 let's go round who's there 1 we don't want to 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.110
 hear more ideas from you write this 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.910
 in the comments what do you think you are 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.570
 think on this video where to me next 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:52.510
 move i naturally read this and 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:55.270
 I will consider because I always listen to 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.180
 opinion of users who watch my 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.050
 video and write anything under them of course 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.389
 same 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.020
 you must listen to your viewers 

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:06.970
 otherwise they just go for it 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:11.699
 happy new year more 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.699
 break through and good luck
