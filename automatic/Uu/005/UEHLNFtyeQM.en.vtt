00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 this need is probably the number one basic for dogs that live 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.540
 indoor 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.260
 ideally, do not allow your puppy to get home to learn 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.909
 do your needs out of place indicated 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:13.180
 this is very simple 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.669
 but demand your time and your attention for a few days 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.779
 Only when you have that disposition will you be free in all your house 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.869
 with a little time a day that you dedicate to your dog 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 It will be more than enough 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.380
 the important thing is that you do not make the mistake 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.910
 your eyes should always be on him 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 When you start sniffing water, turning in circles is a sign that you are 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.410
 about to occur undesirable behavior 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 at that time without eliminated 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.530
 will load it if you take your year in the next few minutes it will 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.190
 At that time you must be present to mark the desired behavior with your 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.789
 clinker 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.789
 and in that moment not awarded 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 you are efe 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.850
 a few days later he will have learned 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.890
 what to do about the toilet on that newspaper to the strike zone and you will know what has 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.270
 creditor to a prize 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.980
 well before you repress it 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 you will be teaching him what he should do 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.260
 when you do not have time available to watch over him 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.620
 must restrict access to home and offers in that small place where 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.900
 yes he wants to do the bathroom 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.960
 will have no other option than that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.829
 remember that what we do not want 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.440
 is that he learns the undesirable behaviors 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.190
 When your present is not present at the moment you do your needs, you will not be able to 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.119
 explanation do not worry 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.650
 remember that positive reinforcement is variable ie 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 that you will only give when you can 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.890
 the more frequent is more efficient will be especially in the bases 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.490
 at night you can leave it in that area or sleep it in its container but 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.740
 very early you should take it out and take it to your newspaper 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.220
 so that it meets your needs so you can mark the desired behavior 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.360
 ideal moments to reinforce these undesirable behaviors are after 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.109
 eat 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.379
 and to drink water or when waking up is when the puppies usually do 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.599
 your needs 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.939
 If your dog already knows how to do where you should on the contrary and have a week 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.109
 without getting anything we can then used the reinforcement of the asset a few hours 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.700
 before putting it home 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 will put your electronic cuÃ©llar on, ready to correct it when 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.169
 go to commit the lack 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.879
 all you have to do is press the button as we show you in the 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.139
 previous chapter 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.039
 born at the time of retirement 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:47.299
 please at that time do not speak and gesticulate as the intention scarce 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.049
 days closed by your dress with your behavior as desirable 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.819
 finished with your person 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.119
 it is important that all your attempts have been frustrated 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.620
 in this way it will be clearer to him 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.149
 and you will learn it fast 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.809
 as you may have already noticed 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.849
 only active positive reinforcements which must be applied 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.159
 just at the time of the actions we want global 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.379
 when we will know that the time has come to be able to leave him alone at home 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.739
 answer is very simple 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.159
 when three or four weeks have passed and you did not have to give a 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.099
 only corrective is to say when he feels the need to run to his 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.390
 newspaper that will be the time indicated in which you will have achieved 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.309
 definitely 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.039
 Remember that it is important that you always have access to your year 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.440
 with the other undesirable behaviors you should do exactly the same 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 First you must try to avoid learning the mistakes 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.550
 and you can reward the absence of undesirable behaviors 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.419
 for example 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.500
 yes, jump 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.169
 you will really turn your back 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.009
 when your legs well a couple of seconds on the floor you mask the behavior and 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.189
 awarded 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.900
 each hazaras larger the time interval 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.769
 I will have to get off and reinforce 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.769
 to the point where you do not have to reinforce them 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:05.189
 with other types of undesirable behaviors such as destruction 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.360
 will be faster with negative reinforcement 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.039
 when you have the time, you are given reinforcements 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.089
 place your collar two hours before and it will disgust you to put the errors to 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.939
 that you can correct if you are constant in a few weeks can the 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.719
 be free in your garden or garage without destroying it 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.229
 how much house without finishing your furniture
