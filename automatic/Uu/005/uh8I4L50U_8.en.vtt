00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.240 

on<00:00:03.300> earth<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.959> have<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.140> lot<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.410> water<00:00:04.799> locked

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
on earth we have a lot of water locked

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.909 
on earth we have a lot of water locked
up<00:00:05.490> as<00:00:05.640> ice<00:00:05.819> particularly<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> poles<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.770> get

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
up as ice particularly the poles you get

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.830 
up as ice particularly the poles you get
really<00:00:08.340> big<00:00:08.580> piles<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.210> ice<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.690> call

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
really big piles of ice and we call

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.490 
really big piles of ice and we call
those<00:00:09.990> ice<00:00:10.170> sheets<00:00:11.960> these<00:00:12.960> ice<00:00:13.139> sheets<00:00:13.380> are

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
those ice sheets these ice sheets are

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
those ice sheets these ice sheets are
great<00:00:13.799> indicators<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.880> what's<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.420> our

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
great indicators of what's going on our

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.560 
great indicators of what's going on our
climate<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.500> there's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> lot<00:00:17.100> of

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
climate so there's a lot of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.680 
climate so there's a lot of
investigation

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
investigation

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.710 
investigation
are<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.140> melting<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.070> melting

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
are they melting are they not melting

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.540 
are they melting are they not melting
because<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.289> melt<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:23.070> raise<00:00:23.369> sea

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
because if they do melt they raise sea

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.700 
because if they do melt they raise sea
level<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.480> affects<00:00:24.810> everybody<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.439> big

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
level and that affects everybody in big

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.220 
level and that affects everybody in big
ways

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770 

she<00:00:34.230> had<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> glacier<00:00:34.860> area<00:00:34.980> Co<00:00:35.820> yeah<00:00:36.420> go

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
she had to the glacier area Co yeah go

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780 
she had to the glacier area Co yeah go
straight<00:00:37.050> over<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.380> glacier<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.860> here

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.550 

we're<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.030> Russell<00:00:42.210> glacier<00:00:42.720> which<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
we're at the Russell glacier which is a

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.020 
we're at the Russell glacier which is a
small<00:00:43.920> outlet<00:00:44.220> glacier<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> edge<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.970> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
small outlet glacier on the edge of the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.150 
small outlet glacier on the edge of the
Greenland<00:00:45.210> ice<00:00:45.390> sheet

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.060 

AB<00:00:51.520> glacier<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.210> ice<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.630> motion<00:00:53.020> it's<00:00:53.590> flowing

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
AB glacier is ice in motion it's flowing

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.240 
AB glacier is ice in motion it's flowing
under<00:00:54.400> its<00:00:54.550> own<00:00:54.640> weight

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
under its own weight

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.030 
under its own weight
if<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.030> were<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.930> stand<00:00:58.380> here<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> camera

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
if you were to stand here with a camera

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.270 
if you were to stand here with a camera
day<00:00:59.490> after<00:00:59.820> day<00:00:59.970> what<00:01:00.630> you<00:01:00.810> would<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
day after day what you would see is the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.430 
day after day what you would see is the
ice<00:01:02.460> marching<00:01:03.120> towards<00:01:03.420> us<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> falling<00:01:04.260> off

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
ice marching towards us and falling off

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.780 
ice marching towards us and falling off
and<00:01:04.710> falling<00:01:04.980> on

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.859 

when<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> Greenland<00:01:12.509> ice<00:01:12.570> sheet<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
when they say the Greenland ice sheet is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.130 
when they say the Greenland ice sheet is
melting<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.829> that<00:01:14.040> happens<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
melting the way that happens is the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
melting the way that happens is the
outlet<00:01:16.409> glacier<00:01:16.799> Sepideh

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.210 

when<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.480> outlet<00:01:28.750> glaciers<00:01:29.080> speed<00:01:29.350> up<00:01:29.500> more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
when the outlet glaciers speed up more

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
when the outlet glaciers speed up more
ice<00:01:30.400> breaks<00:01:30.760> off<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.270> fjords<00:01:33.300> it's<00:01:34.300> not<00:01:34.570> as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
ice breaks off in the fjords it's not as

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.870 
ice breaks off in the fjords it's not as
if<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.830> entire<00:01:36.100> surface<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.760> Greenland

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
if the entire surface of the Greenland

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.440 
if the entire surface of the Greenland
ice<00:01:37.150> sheet<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.450> melting<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:39.130> actual<00:01:39.640> melting

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
ice sheet is melting the actual melting

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.360 
ice sheet is melting the actual melting
of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.600> ice<00:01:40.690> most<00:01:41.230> of<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.500> takes<00:01:41.800> place<00:01:42.100> at

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
of the ice most of that takes place at

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:54.870 
of the ice most of that takes place at
the<00:01:42.610> coast<00:01:52.350> yeah<00:01:53.350> for<00:01:53.740> Greenland<00:01:54.040> what<00:01:54.730> we're

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the coast yeah for Greenland what we're

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.030 
the coast yeah for Greenland what we're
seeing<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.570> quite<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.960> bit<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.290> change<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.980> I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
seeing is quite a bit of change and I

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.850 
seeing is quite a bit of change and I
think<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.340> lot<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.730> change<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.590> surprising<00:01:59.590> a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
think a lot of a change is surprising a

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.650 
think a lot of a change is surprising a
great<00:02:00.340> number<00:02:00.550> of<00:02:00.760> scientists<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:04.270> know<00:02:04.390> are

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
great number of scientists you know are

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.030 
great number of scientists you know are
glaciers<00:02:05.050> around<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.410> world<00:02:05.620> are<00:02:05.830> melting

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
glaciers around the world are melting

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.870 
glaciers around the world are melting
but<00:02:06.370> they<00:02:06.460> don't<00:02:06.640> hold<00:02:06.850> all<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.450> much<00:02:07.690> water

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
but they don't hold all that much water

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.490 
but they don't hold all that much water
Greenland<00:02:09.880> has<00:02:10.030> about<00:02:10.360> seven<00:02:10.869> meters<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.350> sea

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
Greenland has about seven meters of sea

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
Greenland has about seven meters of sea
level<00:02:11.530> equivalent<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.430> if<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.640> ice<00:02:12.820> sheet

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
level equivalent so if that ice sheet

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.600 
level equivalent so if that ice sheet
melts<00:02:13.270> all<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.990> will<00:02:14.620> get<00:02:14.740> seven<00:02:15.160> meters<00:02:15.460> of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
melts all of it will get seven meters of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.870 
melts all of it will get seven meters of
sea<00:02:15.760> level<00:02:15.790> rise<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.690> over<00:02:17.530> 20<00:02:17.770> feet<00:02:18.130> if

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
sea level rise that's over 20 feet if

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.820 
sea level rise that's over 20 feet if

the West ionic Ice Sheet the one down in
the<00:02:20.860> southern<00:02:21.220> hemisphere<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.790> we're

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the southern hemisphere that we're

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.820 
the southern hemisphere that we're
worried<00:02:22.120> about<00:02:22.180> melts<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.500> could<00:02:23.680> give<00:02:23.800> us

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
worried about melts that could give us

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.250 
worried about melts that could give us
five<00:02:24.400> meters<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.970> sea<00:02:25.120> level<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.690> up<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> about

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
five meters of sea level so up to about

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.510 
five meters of sea level so up to about
40<00:02:26.590> feet<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.490> sea<00:02:27.730> level<00:02:27.760> could<00:02:28.060> result<00:02:28.390> if<00:02:28.690> we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
40 feet of sea level could result if we

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680 
40 feet of sea level could result if we
melt<00:02:30.520> both<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.209> these<00:02:31.330> ice<00:02:31.540> sheets<00:02:33.690> it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
melt both of these ice sheets it's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.449 
melt both of these ice sheets it's
pretty<00:02:34.989> important<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.470> look<00:02:35.739> back<00:02:36.100> at<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
pretty important to look back at the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
red that would be submerged with six

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.250 
red that would be submerged with six

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
meters of sea level rise so six meters

of<00:04:50.350> sea<00:04:50.470> level<00:04:50.500> doesn't<00:04:51.280> sound<00:04:51.490> like<00:04:51.640> very

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
of sea level doesn't sound like very

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.930 
of sea level doesn't sound like very
much<00:04:51.940> but<00:04:52.120> it'll<00:04:52.840> affect<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.530> very<00:04:54.310> large<00:04:54.580> part

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
much but it'll affect a very large part

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.880 
much but it'll affect a very large part

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.520 
when we zoom in to finer spatial scales
it<00:05:03.190> allows<00:05:03.460> us<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.789> put<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.419> more<00:05:04.630> human<00:05:04.960> face<00:05:05.200> on

in<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:32.070> case<00:05:32.340> we<00:05:32.970> know<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.600> sea<00:05:33.990> level<00:05:34.290> was

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
in this case we know the sea level was

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.300 
in this case we know the sea level was
higher<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.190> past<00:05:36.620> we<00:05:37.620> know<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.130> was

higher in the past we know that was

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.620 
higher in the past we know that was
because<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.910> earth<00:05:39.030> was<00:05:39.240> warmer

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
because the earth was warmer

over the Greenland ice sheet the big

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.130 
over the Greenland ice sheet the big
question<00:05:44.700> is<00:05:44.820> how<00:05:45.000> much<00:05:45.060> warmer<00:05:45.450> was<00:05:45.630> it<00:05:45.810> and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
question is how much warmer was it and

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.340 
question is how much warmer was it and
