00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.769
 the worthiest is granted the power to raise and 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.549
 then nonsense and this is no no we will not say 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:21.100
 and raise per watt from under the stern yes 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.730
 Of course the water is harsh but I am fair 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.730
 now 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.410
 do you even pull us on the same team 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 want to bring the corner 1 pull 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.219
 I rarely handle in contests 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 engraved so what if this is a cipher 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.979
 specifically written for torus 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 that what I theory is very curious but 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:56.449
 friend's business we are all not worthy science is not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.449
 and 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:15.540
 it is not worthy to kill a bunch of fetters 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 such are the chains 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.320
 this is the end of the way that we have chosen 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.320
 nothing lasts forever 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 1 layer 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.840
 like 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.530
 it's all chains
