but<00:01:56.790> I've<00:01:56.909> been<00:01:56.969> doing<00:01:57.149> 35<00:01:57.420> minutes<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> cardio

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
but I've been doing 35 minutes of cardio

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
but I've been doing 35 minutes of cardio
every<00:01:58.170> day<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
every day and that you know that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
every day and that you know that
definitely<00:02:00.299> puts<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:01.049> bit<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.469> work

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
definitely puts a little bit of work

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.679 
definitely puts a little bit of work
into<00:02:01.799> my<00:02:02.009> legs<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:02.969> necessarily<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
into my legs it's not necessarily the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.039 
into my legs it's not necessarily the
the<00:02:04.100> hypertrophy<00:02:05.100> leg<00:02:05.820> training<00:02:06.210> style<00:02:06.780> or

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the hypertrophy leg training style or

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.570 
the hypertrophy leg training style or
the<00:02:07.140> strength<00:02:07.409> training<00:02:07.799> style<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> get

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the strength training style that I get

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.180 
the strength training style that I get
into<00:02:08.879> when<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.569> bulking<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.950> still

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
into when I'm bulking but it's still

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550 
into when I'm bulking but it's still
valuable<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.690> let<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.260> wait

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
valuable I think for me to let this wait

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.790 
valuable I think for me to let this wait
the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
the
I'm<00:02:13.830> doing<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.400> sink<00:02:14.730> into<00:02:14.820> my<00:02:15.060> legs<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:15.990> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I'm doing just sink into my legs take it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.440 
I'm doing just sink into my legs take it
as<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.350> opportunity<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
as an opportunity to you know get nice a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
as an opportunity to you know get nice a
full<00:02:19.020> range<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.530> motion<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.950> my<00:02:20.160> legs<00:02:20.400> since<00:02:21.000> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
full range of motion for my legs since I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330 
full range of motion for my legs since I
am<00:02:21.300> running<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.720> much<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.170> uh<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:23.220> been

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
am running so much and uh it's been

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.010 
am running so much and uh it's been
working<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.670> well<00:02:23.850> for<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.120> still<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.810> want

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
working out well for me I still do want

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.740 
working out well for me I still do want
to<00:02:25.080> maintain<00:02:25.230> some<00:02:25.710> intensity<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:26.910> but

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to maintain some intensity and I do but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.990 
to maintain some intensity and I do but
obviously<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.740> intensity<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.610> coming

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
obviously the intensity is not coming

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.820 
obviously the intensity is not coming
from<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> weight<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.750> I'm<00:02:30.870> moving<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.380> it's

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
from the weight that I'm moving and it's

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.860 
from the weight that I'm moving and it's
as<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.490> result<00:02:32.910> more<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> amount<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.630> focus

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
as a result more of the amount of focus

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140 
as a result more of the amount of focus
i'm<00:02:34.200> putting<00:02:34.470> into<00:02:34.620> these<00:02:34.830> movements<00:02:35.160> trying

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
i'm putting into these movements trying

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.510 
i'm putting into these movements trying
to<00:02:36.240> use<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.630> form<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.860> feel<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.160> even<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
to use good form and I feel like even on

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.340 
to use good form and I feel like even on
these<00:02:38.670> particular<00:02:38.910> squats<00:02:39.570> right<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:39.900> I'm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
these particular squats right here I'm

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.540 
these particular squats right here I'm
getting<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.710> little<00:02:40.800> bit<00:02:40.980> fast<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
getting a little bit fast with the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
getting a little bit fast with the
movements<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.660> am<00:02:42.930> trying<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.320> stay

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
movements but I am trying to stay

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
movements but I am trying to stay
focused<00:02:43.650> I'm<00:02:43.950> trying<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> keep<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.430> core<00:02:44.790> tight

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
focused I'm trying to keep my core tight

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
focused I'm trying to keep my core tight
trying<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> still<00:02:45.990> breathe<00:02:46.260> obviously<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.550> uh

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
trying to still breathe obviously but uh

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.910 
trying to still breathe obviously but uh
the<00:02:48.420> leg<00:02:48.600> training<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.080> less<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.530> trying<00:02:49.890> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the leg training is less about trying to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620 
the leg training is less about trying to
put<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.190> massive<00:02:50.640> amounts<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:50.970> muscle<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.510> my

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
put on massive amounts of muscle in my

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.750 
put on massive amounts of muscle in my
legs<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.920> more<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:53.100> using

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
legs right now and it's more about using

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.450 
legs right now and it's more about using
the<00:02:54.080> compound<00:02:55.080> movements<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.740> engage<00:02:56.040> as<00:02:56.220> as

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
the compound movements to engage as as

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.200 
the compound movements to engage as as
much<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.960> know<00:02:57.990> of<00:02:58.230> my<00:02:58.380> body<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.940> one

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
much you know of my body as I can so one

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.150 
much you know of my body as I can so one
of<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.360> things<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.630> people<00:03:01.500> say<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.070> if

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
of the things that people say is like if

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.470 
of the things that people say is like if
you're<00:03:02.280> training<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.580> for<00:03:02.940> physique<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.360> lot

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
you're training with for physique a lot

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240 
you're training with for physique a lot
of<00:03:03.540> people<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.930> say<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.680> don't<00:03:05.100> even

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
of people just say you know don't even

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.130 
of people just say you know don't even
bother<00:03:05.400> training<00:03:05.910> legs<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.480> do<00:03:06.600> cardio<00:03:06.630> but

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
bother training legs just do cardio but

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.210 
bother training legs just do cardio but
that's<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.770> want<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that's not really what I want to do I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.520 
that's not really what I want to do I
still<00:03:08.520> think<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.760> training<00:03:09.120> legs<00:03:09.270> is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
still think that training legs is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.680 
still think that training legs is
worthwhile<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.820> know<00:03:11.910> legs<00:03:12.150> even<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.570> I'm

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
worthwhile and you know legs even if I'm

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.540 
worthwhile and you know legs even if I'm
not<00:03:12.720> showing<00:03:13.050> them<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> physique<00:03:13.560> show<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.040> am

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
not showing them in a physique show I am

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.040 
not showing them in a physique show I am
still<00:03:14.820> proud<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.270> my<00:03:15.360> leg<00:03:15.540> development<00:03:16.020> i

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
still proud of my leg development i

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.770 
still proud of my leg development i
think<00:03:16.200> that's<00:03:16.350> come<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> long<00:03:16.860> way<00:03:17.750> over<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
think that's come a long way over the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
think that's come a long way over the
years<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.110> I've<00:03:19.200> been<00:03:19.230> training<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.739> a

will<00:03:27.480> continue<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.930> focus<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
will continue to focus that that you

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.520 
will continue to focus that that you
know<00:03:29.520> leg<00:03:29.790> development<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:30.450> also<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> lot

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
know leg development but also as a lot

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.600 
know leg development but also as a lot
of<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> guys<00:03:31.739> have<00:03:31.860> noticed<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.310> need<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.489> focus

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
of you guys have noticed I need to focus

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.430 
of you guys have noticed I need to focus
on<00:03:32.850> my<00:03:32.970> shoulders<00:03:33.390> my<00:03:33.420> upper<00:03:33.810> back<00:03:33.989> upper

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
on my shoulders my upper back upper

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.979 
on my shoulders my upper back upper
chest<00:03:34.820> pretty<00:03:35.820> much<00:03:35.940> everything<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.660> feel<00:03:36.870> like

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
chest pretty much everything I feel like

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.440 
chest pretty much everything I feel like
needs<00:03:37.260> um<00:03:37.620> needs<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.550> grow<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:39.270> we'll<00:03:39.420> be

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
needs um needs to grow but we'll be

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.479 
needs um needs to grow but we'll be
doing<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.050> time<00:03:40.350> goes<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.739> but<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
doing that as time goes on but like I

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.400 
doing that as time goes on but like I
mentioned<00:03:41.880> right<00:03:42.150> now<00:03:42.300> another<00:03:42.989> reason<00:03:43.170> why<00:03:43.380> I

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
mentioned right now another reason why I

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.870 
mentioned right now another reason why I
think<00:03:43.620> training<00:03:43.950> legs<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.400> important<00:03:44.790> is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
think training legs is so important is

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.449 
think training legs is so important is
because<00:03:44.910> legs<00:03:45.630> are<00:03:45.840> huge<00:03:46.200> muscles<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.980> if

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
because legs are huge muscles and if

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.430 
because legs are huge muscles and if
you're<00:03:47.580> putting<00:03:47.850> them<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.020> position<00:03:49.140> where

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you're putting them in a position where

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320 
you're putting them in a position where
they're<00:03:50.100> getting<00:03:50.220> exercise<00:03:50.640> you're<00:03:51.030> burning

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
they're getting exercise you're burning

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.090 
they're getting exercise you're burning
a<00:03:51.390> lot<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.810> calories<00:03:52.020> with<00:03:52.800> all<00:03:52.950> those

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
a lot of calories with all those

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.920 
a lot of calories with all those
gigantic<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:54.030> know<00:03:54.150> leg<00:03:54.360> muscles<00:03:54.810> that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
gigantic you know leg muscles that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.479 
gigantic you know leg muscles that
you've<00:03:55.080> got<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.500> when<00:03:55.980> they<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.250> recover

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
you've got and when they have to recover

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.280 
you've got and when they have to recover
there<00:03:56.820> also<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.120> know<00:03:57.360> taking<00:03:57.840> up<00:03:58.020> a<00:03:58.110> little

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
there also you know taking up a little

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.930 
there also you know taking up a little
bit<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> calories<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.280> do<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.550> recovery

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
bit of calories to do that recovery

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.210 
bit of calories to do that recovery
process<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.080> think<00:04:01.350> that's<00:04:01.500> worthwhile<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
process so I think that's worthwhile to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.910 
process so I think that's worthwhile to
me<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:03.300> make<00:04:03.570> use<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.840> as<00:04:04.080> much<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.500> my<00:04:04.620> body

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
me is to make use of as much of my body

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.970 
me is to make use of as much of my body
as<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.130> fat<00:04:05.489> burning<00:04:05.730> tool<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.360> i<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.350> i

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
as a fat burning tool as i can and i

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.160 
as a fat burning tool as i can and i
don't<00:04:08.580> think<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.730> requires<00:04:09.180> me<00:04:09.540> lifting

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
don't think that requires me lifting

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
don't think that requires me lifting
massive<00:04:10.590> weight<00:04:10.830> but<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.489> i<00:04:11.580> am<00:04:11.700> putting<00:04:11.880> you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
massive weight but if i am putting you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.490 
massive weight but if i am putting you
know<00:04:12.269> my<00:04:12.360> legs<00:04:12.570> enter<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> solid<00:04:13.110> time<00:04:13.260> under

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
know my legs enter a solid time under

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.620 
know my legs enter a solid time under
tension<00:04:13.530> good<00:04:14.459> range<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.850> motion<00:04:15.000> just<00:04:15.330> feels

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
tension good range of motion just feels

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.659 
tension good range of motion just feels
good<00:04:15.900> just<00:04:16.380> still<00:04:16.680> feels<00:04:17.040> really<00:04:17.400> nice<00:04:17.609> to

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
good just still feels really nice to

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.479 
good just still feels really nice to
train<00:04:18.120> legs<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:19.109> helps<00:04:19.350> me<00:04:19.500> maintain<00:04:19.980> that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
train legs and it helps me maintain that

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.159 
train legs and it helps me maintain that
balanced<00:04:21.000> physique<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.870> helps<00:04:22.080> me

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
balanced physique and it helps me

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.230 
balanced physique and it helps me
maintain<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.860> overall<00:04:23.220> intensity<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.120> my

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
maintain that overall intensity to my

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360 
maintain that overall intensity to my
training<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:25.110> I've<00:04:25.560> sort<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.830> maintained

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
training that I've sort of maintained

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.470 
training that I've sort of maintained
for<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.640> long<00:04:26.850> time

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
for a long time

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.750 
for a long time
now<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.960> my<00:04:28.110> leg<00:04:28.290> days<00:04:28.500> recently<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.250> really

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
now on my leg days recently I really

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.000 
now on my leg days recently I really
haven't<00:04:29.940> been<00:04:30.060> going<00:04:30.390> much<00:04:30.600> above<00:04:31.020> 185

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
haven't been going much above 185

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.040 
haven't been going much above 185
sometimes<00:04:32.550> I'll<00:04:32.790> I'll<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:33.480> cute<00:04:33.750> I'll<00:04:33.870> do

some 205's if I'm feeling really really

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.530 
some 205's if I'm feeling really really
good<00:04:36.390> I'll<00:04:37.260> go<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:37.740> 225<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:39.120> I'm<00:04:39.210> not<00:04:39.390> really

good I'll go for 225 but I'm not really
like<00:04:40.190> forcing<00:04:41.190> myself<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.670> do<00:04:41.880> those<00:04:42.090> four

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
like forcing myself to do those four

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.900 
like forcing myself to do those four
strips<00:04:42.780> where<00:04:43.110> I'm<00:04:43.590> sort<00:04:43.920> of<00:04:43.950> even<00:04:44.730> getting

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
strips where I'm sort of even getting

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.050 
strips where I'm sort of even getting
out<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.270> my<00:04:45.480> mine<00:04:46.230> or<00:04:46.500> Mille<00:04:46.680> nice<00:04:47.430> smooth

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
out of my mine or Mille nice smooth

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.450 
out of my mine or Mille nice smooth
range<00:04:48.420> of<00:04:48.600> motion<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.170> definitely<00:04:49.830> do<00:04:50.100> want<00:04:50.130> to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
range of motion I definitely do want to

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.610 
range of motion I definitely do want to
engage<00:04:50.610> with<00:04:50.850> my<00:04:51.180> intensity<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.900> dig<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.530> a

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
engage with my intensity and dig in a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.800 
engage with my intensity and dig in a
little<00:04:52.650> bit<00:04:52.980> but<00:04:53.460> I'm<00:04:53.880> always<00:04:54.210> using<00:04:54.360> that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
little bit but I'm always using that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.900 
little bit but I'm always using that
intensity<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.560> dig<00:04:55.770> into<00:04:55.980> leg<00:04:56.310> day<00:04:56.520> as<00:04:56.670> much

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
intensity to dig into leg day as much

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.190 
intensity to dig into leg day as much
like<00:04:57.150> like<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.420> said<00:04:57.630> earlier<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.110> video

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
like like I said earlier in the video

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.970 
like like I said earlier in the video
leg<00:04:58.950> day<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.430> me<00:04:59.550> as<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.730> chance<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.330> sort<00:05:00.540> of

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
leg day for me as a chance to sort of

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.130 
leg day for me as a chance to sort of
engage<00:05:01.980> with<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.280> Zen<00:05:02.700> style<00:05:03.180> just<00:05:03.780> give<00:05:03.960> my

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
nice stretching out my leg muscles nice

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.730 
nice stretching out my leg muscles nice
contraction<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.840> those<00:05:09.990> leg<00:05:10.200> muscles<00:05:10.230> give

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
contraction of those leg muscles give

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.250 
contraction of those leg muscles give
them<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:10.950> chance<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.450> let<00:05:12.450> my<00:05:12.570> upper<00:05:12.780> body<00:05:12.900> rest

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
them a chance to let my upper body rest

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.900 
them a chance to let my upper body rest
a<00:05:13.380> little<00:05:13.530> bit<00:05:13.710> while<00:05:14.310> still<00:05:14.490> getting<00:05:14.640> some

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
a little bit while still getting some

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.520 
a little bit while still getting some
really<00:05:15.060> good<00:05:15.180> exercise<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.170> is

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
really good exercise so it is

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.470 
really good exercise so it is
interesting<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.070> see<00:05:17.340> how<00:05:17.610> throughout<00:05:18.390> the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
interesting to see how throughout the

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.090 
interesting to see how throughout the
course<00:05:18.750> of<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.020> training<00:05:19.350> for<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> physique

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
course of the training for a physique

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.090 
course of the training for a physique
show<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:21.390> might<00:05:21.540> that<00:05:21.720> my<00:05:21.870> actual<00:05:22.800> training

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
show that might that my actual training

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.150 
show that might that my actual training
mindset<00:05:23.670> changed<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.270> bit<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:25.620> don't

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
mindset changed a little bit and I don't

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.100 
mindset changed a little bit and I don't
I<00:05:26.310> don't<00:05:26.340> want<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.850> give<00:05:27.300> myself<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.930> know<00:05:27.960> too

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
I don't want to give myself you know too

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.410 
I don't want to give myself you know too
easy<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.860> time<00:05:29.070> but<00:05:29.280> at<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.370> same<00:05:29.430> time<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.120> am

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
easy of a time but at the same time I am

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.300 
easy of a time but at the same time I am
only<00:05:30.810> two<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.260> half<00:05:31.410> weeks<00:05:31.440> out<00:05:31.920> right<00:05:32.130> now

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
only two and a half weeks out right now

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.940 
only two and a half weeks out right now
so<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:32.940> think<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.570> okay<00:05:34.110> for<00:05:34.140> me<00:05:34.530> if<00:05:34.680> I'm<00:05:34.800> not

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
so I think it is okay for me if I'm not

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.980 
so I think it is okay for me if I'm not
absolutely<00:05:35.190> killing<00:05:35.760> myself<00:05:36.060> at<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.960> gym

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
absolutely killing myself at the gym

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.170 
absolutely killing myself at the gym
every<00:05:37.350> day<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:38.070> know<00:05:38.100> I'm<00:05:38.310> sort<00:05:38.520> of<00:05:38.580> easily

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
every day you know I'm sort of easily

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.680 
every day you know I'm sort of easily
smoothly<00:05:40.190> approaching<00:05:41.190> uh<00:05:41.520> what<00:05:42.270> can<00:05:42.540> be

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
smoothly approaching uh what can be

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.240 
smoothly approaching uh what can be
called<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.020> peak<00:05:43.290> week<00:05:43.560> but<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.800> think<00:05:43.980> I<00:05:44.040> still

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
called the peak week but I think I still

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.860 
called the peak week but I think I still
will<00:05:44.370> be<00:05:44.460> training<00:05:44.730> pretty<00:05:45.240> hard<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.690> peak

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
will be training pretty hard in the peak

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.020 
will be training pretty hard in the peak
week<00:05:46.110> I'm<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:46.770> not<00:05:46.950> killing<00:05:47.340> myself<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:47.820> leg

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
to have good training days so I can

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.360 
to have good training days so I can
tighten<00:06:33.270> up<00:06:33.330> any<00:06:33.960> sort<00:06:34.320> of<00:06:34.410> muscle<00:06:35.190> groups
