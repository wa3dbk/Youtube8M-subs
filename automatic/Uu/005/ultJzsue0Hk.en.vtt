00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.230 
since this phone doesn't drain a lot of
battery<00:02:20.630> because<00:02:21.630> since<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.710> only<00:02:22.800> uses<00:02:23.240> 256

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
battery because since it only uses 256

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.130 
battery because since it only uses 256
megabytes<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.900> RAM<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.150> only<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:27.960> a

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
megabytes of RAM and only I think it's a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
megabytes of RAM and only I think it's a
1<00:02:28.320> gigahertz

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
1 gigahertz

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.000 
1 gigahertz
I<00:02:29.190> mean<00:02:29.520> 800<00:02:30.480> megahertz<00:02:30.780> processor<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.770> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
I mean 800 megahertz processor so this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.730 
I mean 800 megahertz processor so this
phone<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.459> definitely<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.470> drain<00:02:34.709> a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
phone is definitely not going to drain a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
time could be up to 35 hours talktime 10

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010 
time could be up to 35 hours talktime 10
hours<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.160> standby<00:02:41.970> time<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.510> around<00:02:42.750> six

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020

hundred and seventy hours on 2g and 720
hours<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:48.030> 3G<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.260> extremely<00:02:49.530> impressive

we<00:03:55.040> saw<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> bit<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:55.670> like<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.940> butt<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.700> this

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
we saw a bit of like a butt so this

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.090 
we saw a bit of like a butt so this
phone<00:04:14.360> is<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.510> bit<00:04:14.840> laggy<00:04:15.140> since<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:15.920> only

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
phone is a bit laggy since it's only

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.090 
phone is a bit laggy since it's only
since<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.000> only<00:04:17.090> has<00:04:17.209> 256<00:04:18.139> megahertz<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:18.889> RAM

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
since it only has 256 megahertz of RAM

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.980 
since it only has 256 megahertz of RAM
but<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.329> think<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.530> playable<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.990> it's

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
but I think it it's playable and it's

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.260 
but I think it it's playable and it's
not<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.200> bad<00:04:24.440> since<00:04:25.040> its<00:04:25.490> own<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:25.910> quite<00:04:26.060> in

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
not that bad since its own is quite in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:35.080 
not that bad since its own is quite in
the<00:04:26.389> budget<00:04:26.780> for<00:04:26.960> many<00:04:27.440> people<00:04:33.700> ok<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:34.760> as<00:04:35.060> you
