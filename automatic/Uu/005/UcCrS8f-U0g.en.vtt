00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's immediately turned into sugar and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's immediately turned into sugar and
in<00:01:00.030> order<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.390> maintain<00:01:00.690> optimal<00:01:01.500> health<00:01:01.739> your

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
in order to maintain optimal health your

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
in order to maintain optimal health your
body<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.789> something<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
body has to do something with this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.359 
body has to do something with this
excess<00:01:04.199> sugar<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> produces<00:01:06.060> insulin<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
excess sugar so it produces insulin and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
excess sugar so it produces insulin and
insulin<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> fat<00:01:08.820> storage<00:01:09.360> warm<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
insulin is a fat storage warm so it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
insulin is a fat storage warm so it
takes<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> sugar<00:01:11.850> turns<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.450> into<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
takes the sugar turns it into and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.429 
takes the sugar turns it into and
stores<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.070> later<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.229> thing

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
stores it for later use the only thing

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
stores it for later use the only thing
is<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.830> never<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is that we never have to go back to the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
is that we never have to go back to the
store<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> food<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.680> we're

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
store for that food because we're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.210 
store for that food because we're
constantly<00:01:20.220> eating<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:22.710> constant

consumption of low nutritional

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
consumption of low nutritional
carbohydrates<00:01:27.570> puts<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.470> enormous<00:01:28.770> load<00:01:29.250> on

our bodies in particular or pancreas

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.940 
our bodies in particular or pancreas
which<00:01:31.829> produces<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> insulin<00:01:33.509> and
