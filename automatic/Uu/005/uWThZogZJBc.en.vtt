00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
right in the middle where so we're known

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.270 
right in the middle where so we're known
for<00:00:52.289> clean<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> we're<00:00:53.640> known<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
for clean and we're known for this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.450 
for clean and we're known for this
overdrive<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:57.539> esper<00:00:57.930> basic<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.739> do

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.700 

it's<00:01:04.970> not<00:01:05.150> like<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.480> have<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> run<00:01:06.050> up<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.290> seven

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's not like you have to run up a seven

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.870 
it's not like you have to run up a seven
for<00:01:07.580> them<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.820> sound<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:09.080> know<00:01:09.170> they'll<00:01:09.380> still

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
for them to sound you know they'll still

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.130 
for them to sound you know they'll still
they'll<00:01:10.880> do<00:01:11.060> varying<00:01:11.510> things<00:01:11.720> although<00:01:11.960> we

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
they'll do varying things although we

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.730 
they'll do varying things although we
are<00:01:12.730> opening<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:13.910> sedan<00:01:14.180> already<00:01:14.780> station<00:01:15.200> it

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
are opening a sedan already station it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.620 
are opening a sedan already station it
is<00:01:15.860> still<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:16.700> faster<00:01:17.030> don't<00:01:17.210> do<00:01:17.450> that

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
is still a lot faster don't do that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.770 
is still a lot faster don't do that
obviously<00:01:18.260> divorcing<00:01:19.010> insurance<00:01:19.820> might<00:01:20.420> make

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
obviously divorcing insurance might make

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.880 
obviously divorcing insurance might make
patrols<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:21.860> hard<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.190> dial<00:01:22.580> bad<00:01:22.940> sound<00:01:23.890> I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
patrols so it's hard to dial bad sound I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.270 
patrols so it's hard to dial bad sound I
mean<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.610> lot<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.090> trials<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.750> amps<00:01:27.190> once<00:01:28.190> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
mean a lot and trials on amps once the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.890 
mean a lot and trials on amps once the
players<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.730> Nampa<00:01:29.180> year<00:01:29.420> they're<00:01:29.660> pretty

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
players that Nampa year they're pretty

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.420 
players that Nampa year they're pretty
much<00:01:30.080> they<00:01:30.290> could<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.590> glued<00:01:30.830> down<00:01:31.100> and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
much they could be glued down and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.130 
much they could be glued down and
wouldn't<00:01:31.580> now<00:01:31.760> there's<00:01:32.450> no<00:01:32.780> point<00:01:33.080> having

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
wouldn't now there's no point having

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.650 
wouldn't now there's no point having
2002<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.340> idea<00:01:37.729> with<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
2002 it's a the idea with that is that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.219 
2002 it's a the idea with that is that
it<00:01:38.869> keeps<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.440> guitars<00:01:40.090> integrity<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.930> if

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
it keeps the guitars integrity so if

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.960 
it keeps the guitars integrity so if
it's<00:01:42.380> telly<00:01:42.680> still<00:01:43.220> with<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.369> cemetery

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it's telly still with the cemetery

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180 
it's telly still with the cemetery
strats<00:01:44.960> still<00:01:45.320> gonna<00:01:45.440> sound<00:01:45.650> what's<00:01:45.890> right

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
strats still gonna sound what's right

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.300 
strats still gonna sound what's right
for<00:01:46.580> less<00:01:46.790> polished<00:01:47.180> myself<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:48.830> pass<00:01:49.040> that

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
for less polished myself you pass that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.040 
for less polished myself you pass that
guitar<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.940> another<00:01:50.180> player<00:01:50.479> it's<00:01:50.840> going<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
guitar to another player it's going to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.050 
guitar to another player it's going to
sound<00:01:51.170> different<00:01:51.760> because<00:01:52.760> it's<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:53.030> different

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
sound different because it's a different

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.990 
sound different because it's a different
plane<00:01:53.510> it's<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.140> wooden<00:01:54.410> finger<00:01:54.800> really<00:01:55.100> so

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
plane it's a wooden finger really so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.630 
plane it's a wooden finger really so
there<00:01:56.840> are<00:01:56.990> some<00:01:57.140> apps<00:01:57.320> out<00:01:57.530> there<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.800> they

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
there are some apps out there that they

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.240 
there are some apps out there that they
thought<00:01:58.880> yeah<00:01:59.119> they<00:01:59.840> mask<00:02:00.140> guitars<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.010> lot

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
thought yeah they mask guitars a lot

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.550 
thought yeah they mask guitars a lot

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
I'll try not to do that and that's one

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880 
I'll try not to do that and that's one
