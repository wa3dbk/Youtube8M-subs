00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
um so I guess I'm just going to get into

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
um so I guess I'm just going to get into
building<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.439> hair<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.279> doing<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
building my hair and what I'm doing and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
building my hair and what I'm doing and
everything<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> took<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> shower<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
everything so I took a shower this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100 
everything so I took a shower this
morning<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.820> waited<00:00:36.239> until<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.899> hair

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
morning and they waited until my hair

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
morning and they waited until my hair
naturally<00:00:37.620> dried<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.219> all<00:00:38.340> straightened

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
naturally dried so it's all straightened

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
naturally dried so it's all straightened
or<00:00:38.940> anything<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.540> curly<00:00:40.050> hair<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.500> would

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
or anything with your curly hair I would

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
or anything with your curly hair I would
recommend<00:00:41.129> straightening<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.910> before<00:00:42.329> hand

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
recommend straightening at before hand

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
recommend straightening at before hand
