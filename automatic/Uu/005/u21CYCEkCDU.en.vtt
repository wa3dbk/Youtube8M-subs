00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.039
 It was good. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.760
 The essence has come in. The app itself has changed a lot, 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:49.069
 I think the players have fought a little burden on the Princess How do you think 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.609

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.159
 Today we went down to our defense today and we got a little bellman. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.770
 * Even if the player is attacked by Lee Seung-gyu

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.170
 The defense is going to go up now. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.619
 What do you practice a lot at speed ? 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:35.890

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.270
 How could I have thought that I would not have 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:04.000
 I think if we had that defense 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.700
 I can not really use that as in the other every day that our director 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.429
 Soft Lee 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.900
