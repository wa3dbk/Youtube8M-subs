of my videos and here's a perfect

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.020 
of my videos and here's a perfect
example<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> bench<00:00:43.680> today

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
example I got one on the bench today

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.610 
example I got one on the bench today
it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.149> coming<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.170> well

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's not coming off for me very well

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's not coming off for me very well
so<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> try<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> remove<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so we're going to try to remove it this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.220 
so we're going to try to remove it this
is<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:50.969> don't<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> any<00:00:52.050> other

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
is how I do it I don't know of any other

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
is how I do it I don't know of any other
way<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.430> could<00:00:53.610> probably<00:00:53.699> use<00:00:54.059> an

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
way to do it you could probably use an

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
way to do it you could probably use an
air<00:00:54.360> hammer<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.870> something<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:56.070> basically

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
air hammer or something but basically

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
air hammer or something but basically
what<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.550> old<00:00:59.760> blade<00:01:03.680> well

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
what I do is I get the old blade well

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.289 
what I do is I get the old blade well
first<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.479> run<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.689> nut<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.229> here

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
first I want to run this nut in here

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.070 
first I want to run this nut in here
about<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.729> many<00:01:12.000> times<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.869> really

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
about that many times doesn't really

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
about that many times doesn't really
matter<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:14.310> long<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.549> you've<00:01:14.790> got<00:01:14.820> several

matter as long as you've got several

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.670 
matter as long as you've got several
threads<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.350> don't<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
threads up in there you don't want to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800 
threads up in there you don't want to
damage<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> threads<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:18.330> ahead<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
damage the threads go ahead and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
let me grab a 7/8 wrench to turn this

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.470 
let me grab a 7/8 wrench to turn this
with<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.860> I'll<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.640> back

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480

everything tight torque don't try to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.890 
everything tight torque don't try to
come<00:02:18.360> off<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.810> lot<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.440> times<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.040> just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.300 

sometimes<00:02:27.989> they're<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.470> stuck<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.069> there

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
sometimes they're just stuck on there

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.140 
sometimes they're just stuck on there
like<00:02:29.940> crazy<00:02:30.830> okay<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.340> don't<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.970> saw

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.809 
like crazy okay I don't know if you saw
that<00:02:33.180> move<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.080> did<00:02:34.290> move<00:02:34.819> let's

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
that move or not but it did move let's

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:45.740 
that move or not but it did move let's
go<00:02:35.880> ahead<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.209> remove<00:02:36.480> our<00:02:37.220> tool<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:45.630> was

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
go ahead and remove our tool it was

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.160 
go ahead and remove our tool it was
stuck<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.650> enough<00:02:50.930> or<00:02:51.930> didn't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
stuck on there just enough or didn't

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.120 
stuck on there just enough or didn't
want<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> come<00:02:52.590> off

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
want to come off

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
want to come off
I<00:02:58.489> think<00:03:00.260> backed<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.410> off<00:03:01.470> enough<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:03.570> where

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
I think backed it off enough to where
