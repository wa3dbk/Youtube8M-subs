 I only got it in Japan and I got the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.230

 Let's see charizard with him with the stone of 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.989

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.199
 of the blog was finding pokémon day care 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 center box pt will get the link from 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.830
 entry pass there 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.210
 look this article is going to play as it is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.100
 that you should do the things I 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.080
 I just do it again saved by 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.060
 a proof at the end of the video so now 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 I'll write the euro that is written here 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 I received use of the most miss box 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.409
 so it's great and free that it's free 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.570
 or delays the game idr staff 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.509
 discovered an interesting glitch that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.540
 you can use in your 3 month or 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.759
 two days to receive charizard event 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.130
 united kingdom around the uk and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.130
 I'm sorry, said the bread but not only 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.960
 in the UK game stores is being 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 distributed charizard event that has by 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 purpose is to bring the stone opposite 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 game or have been a little before 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.340
 I'll bring it to charizard there. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.049
 zardari to eye and vice versa because this 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 technique can be used by all who 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.009
 Do you have smartphones with 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 to serve an idiot spot 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 it's not worth trying to do this with 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.750
 every kind of network will not work 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.179
 the steps to realize charizard this 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.770
 works with more than one game tested and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.350
 proven by dust that is a bit 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.350
 eccentric to sounds 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.030
 21 create another point that your sea 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.000
 background as the mother taking spot pass 5 100 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.340
 accurate and case sensitive 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.960
 of Brazilian security or is to give a 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.940
 paper to 2 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.430
 connect your internet access to your 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.460
 phone and then activate the other 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.380
 sport created to configure your 3d 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.000
 express have this network 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.130
 if you can not see the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.210
 pokémon on the internet configure how they do 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.980
 a normal connection 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.050
 one thing I want to sing here is that 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 It's the name they say what to do in my 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.630
 The idea is if you already have an internet 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 configured is pay, right? 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.490
 When will you try to know how to receive a 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.490
 strip tease and they give it to you 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.710
 previous connection and in the es have already received the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.480
 pokémon that was not between the day that 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.970
 the trash you have already received until the pokémon 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.580
 so you can hang up first 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.060
 or to pay for the first call 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.980
 think they've had or still have four 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.990
 after the network is configured between 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.570
 your game is that being ae is a lot 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.690
 simple to enter the mister to choose 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.570
 internet ghetto takes on the pokémon of 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 minimum scale of deliveries on pokémon 60 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.020
 This step ensures that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 charizard event 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.110
 This step ensures that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.760
 charizard event but this one 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.950
 customer brings another advantage to us 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.600
 Portuguese or the blogger text 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.470
 What's below I will not read 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.910
 Why do not you bring anything else from you? 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.980
 receive a pokémon but if they want 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.260
 pass in block was slow in description 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.130
 so it's like this now let's leave it with 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.050
 video proves my proof of how 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.600
 result I hope you enjoy the video leaves 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.370
 your taste is practical in controlling the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.810
 People, everyone knows from here. 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.810
 player the anime went 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
 ae
