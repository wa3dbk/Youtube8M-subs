make sound quiet this way we went

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.300 
make sound quiet this way we went
through<00:00:25.290> a<00:00:25.320> quite<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> process<00:00:25.800> trying<00:00:26.100> to<00:00:26.189> fair

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
through a quite a process trying to fair

through a quite a process trying to fair
what<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.490> infected<00:00:26.939> were<00:00:27.240> gonna<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.869> very

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
what they infected were gonna be a very

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
what they infected were gonna be a very
big<00:00:28.650> directive<00:00:29.040> from<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.490> beginning

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
big directive from the very beginning

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.840 
big directive from the very beginning
was<00:00:30.180> they're<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.990> zombies<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:32.520> early

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
was they're not zombies the early

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.710 
was they're not zombies the early
inception<00:00:33.360> probably<00:00:33.840> came<00:00:34.080> from<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:35.760> BBC<00:00:36.330> video

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
inception probably came from a BBC video

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.930 
inception probably came from a BBC video
we<00:00:36.840> saw<00:00:37.020> called<00:00:37.320> planet<00:00:37.620> earth<00:00:37.850> where<00:00:38.850> they

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
we saw called planet earth where they

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.390 
we saw called planet earth where they
were<00:00:39.030> talking<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.989> quarter<00:00:40.739> cept<00:00:40.949> fungus

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
were talking about a quarter cept fungus

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.070 
were talking about a quarter cept fungus
as<00:00:41.970> soon<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.300> saw<00:00:42.449> it<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.629> were<00:00:42.720> intrigued

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
as soon as we saw it we were intrigued

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.470 
as soon as we saw it we were intrigued
by<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.260> idea<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:44.000> what<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.180> jumped<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
by the idea of what if it jumped to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.509 
by the idea of what if it jumped to
humans<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.290> what<00:00:46.500> interesting<00:00:47.070> ways<00:00:47.250> would

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
humans and what interesting ways would

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.329 
humans and what interesting ways would
it<00:00:47.790> take<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.330> human<00:00:48.690> body<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.379> enforce<00:00:50.129> it

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
it take over a human body and enforce it

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.130 
it take over a human body and enforce it
to<00:00:50.519> spread<00:00:50.729> that<00:00:50.790> infection<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.659> we<00:00:51.780> figured

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to spread that infection and we figured

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
to spread that infection and we figured
that<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.470> real<00:00:52.680> evil<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.339> game<00:00:53.519> is<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that the real evil in the game is the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.210 
that the real evil in the game is the
fungus<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> people<00:00:55.409> we<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
fungus it's not the people we want to

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.579 
fungus it's not the people we want to
see<00:00:56.400> what<00:00:57.269> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.540> choice<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.019> human<00:00:58.350> makes

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
see what kind of choice is a human makes

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.399 
see what kind of choice is a human makes
under<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.040> kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> pressure<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.229> we're

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
under that kind of pressure so as we're

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
under that kind of pressure so as we're
trying<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> develop<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.880> look<00:01:06.120> of<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
trying to develop the look of the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
trying to develop the look of the
infected<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:08.190> went<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.060> many

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
infected we went through so many

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
infected we went through so many
different<00:01:09.420> iterations<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.590> looked

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
different iterations some that looked

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
different iterations some that looked
really<00:01:11.549> alien<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:12.510> subhuman<00:01:13.430> some<00:01:14.430> dead<00:01:14.640> look

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
really alien and subhuman some dead look

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.080 
really alien and subhuman some dead look
just<00:01:15.479> essentially<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.290> zombies<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> we

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
just essentially like zombies and we

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.360 
just essentially like zombies and we
couldn't<00:01:18.420> find<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.380> original<00:01:19.680> place<00:01:20.130> for

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
couldn't find like an original place for

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.760 
couldn't find like an original place for
them<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.120> one<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.540> concept<00:01:22.110> artists<00:01:22.590> took

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
them but one of our concept artists took

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.250 
them but one of our concept artists took
a<00:01:22.830> bunch<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.280> images<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.300> diseases<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:24.930> images

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
a bunch of images of diseases or images

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.500 
a bunch of images of diseases or images
of<00:01:25.380> fungal<00:01:25.860> overgrowth<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
of fungal overgrowth and you kind of

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.270 
of fungal overgrowth and you kind of
mash<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:27.900> together<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.680> threw<00:01:28.980> it<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
mash it all together and you threw it on

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.790 
mash it all together and you threw it on
this<00:01:29.550> person<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.080> definitely<00:01:31.320> very

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
this person it was definitely very

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.480 
this person it was definitely very
challenging<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
challenging to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.600 
challenging to
try<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.240> convert<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.200> D<00:01:35.350> concept<00:01:35.829> into<00:01:36.280> 3d

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
try to convert that to D concept into 3d

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030 
try to convert that to D concept into 3d
getting<00:01:37.540> kind<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.380> feeling<00:01:38.680> right<00:01:38.799> from

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
getting kind of the feeling right from

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.830 
getting kind of the feeling right from
all<00:01:39.250> different<00:01:39.460> angles<00:01:39.700> this<00:01:40.390> isn't<00:01:40.720> some

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
all different angles this isn't some

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.420 
all different angles this isn't some
decaying<00:01:41.259> corpse<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.890> ground<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.399> a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
decaying corpse on the ground this is a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.830 
decaying corpse on the ground this is a
living<00:01:42.670> thing<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:43.330> going<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.570> be<00:01:43.659> coming

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
living thing that's going to be coming

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.260 
living thing that's going to be coming
after<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.409> in<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.619> world<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.759> seems<00:01:46.030> so

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
after you in the world and it seems so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.050 
after you in the world and it seems so
creepy<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.259> unique<00:01:47.830> right<00:01:48.670> away<00:01:48.850> we're

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
creepy and so unique right away we're

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.749 
creepy and so unique right away we're
gravitated<00:01:49.810> towards<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:50.680> like<00:01:50.830> this

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
gravitated towards it and it's like this

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.700 
gravitated towards it and it's like this
is<00:01:51.820> our<00:01:52.119> base<00:01:52.450> infected<00:01:53.080> everything<00:01:53.530> should

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
is our base infected everything should

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.649 
is our base infected everything should
kind<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:53.950> come<00:01:54.130> out<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:54.580> look<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:58.390> use<00:01:58.630> a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
kind of come out of this look they use a

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.109 
kind of come out of this look they use a
form<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.080> echolocation<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.830> track<00:02:00.580> down<00:02:00.820> their

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
form of echolocation to track down their

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.080 
form of echolocation to track down their
enemies<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.500> bats<00:02:02.799> or<00:02:03.189> even<00:02:03.820> some

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
enemies just like bats or even some

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.760 
enemies just like bats or even some
blind<00:02:04.390> people<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.780> see<00:02:05.170> by<00:02:05.350> making<00:02:05.709> a

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
blind people can see by making a

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.070 
blind people can see by making a
clicking<00:02:06.009> sound<00:02:06.209> like<00:02:07.209> Oh<00:02:07.390> what<00:02:07.420> if<00:02:07.720> they<00:02:07.869> make

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
clicking sound like Oh what if they make

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.680 
clicking sound like Oh what if they make
this<00:02:08.289> sound<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.940> now<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.209> could<00:02:10.360> sing<00:02:10.569> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
this sound and now they could sing the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.210 
this sound and now they could sing the
dark<00:02:12.959> sound<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.200> on<00:02:14.380> its<00:02:14.530> own<00:02:14.680> wouldn't<00:02:15.130> be

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
dark sound that on its own wouldn't be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.090
