00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.920
 very good to all kids here dif and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.720
 as they say that we are in another video 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.279
 more for the channel we are here in the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.300
 plant responses and long 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.849
 time they had no questions and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.560
 answers exactly two weeks that 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.180
 for me channels are not weird either because 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.180
 I always have some of the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.529
 week and well I have arrived from london 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.140
 end-of-course trip the truth that 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.580
 I'm very tired, it gives me a lot of stick 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 put me to make videos I think I've 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.019
 already lost the pace I had but good 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.610
 will have to be put again without further 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.010
 to start with the questions we have 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.659
 here to a website that you already know 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 everyone who tells us that you are this has 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.239
 there was a pretty impressive boom and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.620
 you are growing very fast true is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.540
 question think you're going to succeed in 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.489
 youtube in the sense that some of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.799
 that the day comes when you can live from 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.420
 this is good because I think that 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.640
 it's a long way away from living on youtube 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.860
 it's a very clear thing very difficult because 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.720
 otherwise there would not be unemployment all over the world 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 will be here watching youtube therefore 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.860
 do to me at least 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.070
 when turning off the helmets like saying to me 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 I'm a little away, not the subject of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 live from youtube but good he left it in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 incognita and who knows if one day 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.189
 I can live from this hopefully but well 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 in the short term impossible we go to the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.360
 next question he asks us and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.770
 quer Suarez and tells us to see is that he 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.070
 he has written a little bit bad but good 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 He says yes I like body better 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 because he knows that I go to the gym and if I go 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 to the gym and he asked me if 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 I prefer a body the fitness is to say 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.569
 that is strong defined but not at all 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.179
 this as a beast a bodybuilder who 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.250
 that is already a chemical civil body all or 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.289
 whether pricked anything but what 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 you have to click and well 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.039
 clearly I prefer a body 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.630
 muscular but not at all bodybuilder 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.069
 because that already seems pretty ugly not 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 the people there who are going to like a closet 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.640
 with veins and all that seems very ugly 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 but good 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.170
 álex Sanchez García asked us what 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.700
 when you grow up and you're getting married 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830
 if so, how many children are going to have 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 obviously in clear that I'm going to get married and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.060
 I am going to have then I think that I have always 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.040
 had the same idea I'm going to have two or 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.090
 three children he does not care if he's a boy or 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.430
 girl but 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.230
 3 because if you have one is that only son 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 is going to be left as very marginalized no no 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.650
 will enjoy having a brother who 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.599
 It is a very beautiful experience 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.890
 for the one who is an only child will not know 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.650
 but good for those who appreciated that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.360
 I have a brother and another sister 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.459
 he has brothers is very nice because 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 you share things that not with them is like 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.140
 a friend but more and intimate so it's 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.060
 very good and good because that I wanted 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.700
 have two or three children left me like this is 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.069
 boy girl but good two or three 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.230
 next question that makes us john 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.599
 He quoted that says if they buy me the ps4 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.930
 If I plan to buy the 24 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.690
 whenever exclusivity is lost 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.670
 100% already know 100% and all my friends 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.680
 pass appli 4 who are my friends 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.560
 well, well, if they pass peter kenya 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 I giorgio cough people because clearly yes 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.220
 what would happen to me because the case is to be 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.129
 with them , play with them and that they do not 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 always the next question and 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.190
 torrox to palm another that is always 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 here in the answers products 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 along with iker suárez are always having 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.010
 very good video isma so so so 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.160
 he asks us if you liked it so much 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.140
 soccer in which position you played and which 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.420
 players I had an example to follow good 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.390
 well at first sight the game of 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.130
 example I could not tell you but I played in 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.080
 the position of central valley or been 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.470
 central for my height more than anything I have 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.620
 lived 193 or so so well then that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.820
 plays from central to hundred up 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.580
 very little left the football makes a 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.640
 year as a means of geimer kill energy 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.310
 you tell us that it is good to see wait a 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.170
 so you think that if you put the pd 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.210
 inside the earth you are violating the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.820
 mother Nature 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.080

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.879
