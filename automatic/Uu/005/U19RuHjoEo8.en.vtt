advancement there that uh that the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.749 
advancement there that uh that the
Android<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:27.659> made<00:01:27.960> recently<00:01:28.430> if<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.580> your

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
Android has made recently if all your

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
Android has made recently if all your
app<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> running<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.750> drag<00:01:31.080> down

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
app to running you can also drag down

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.310 
app to running you can also drag down
and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.430> choosing<00:01:32.820> between<00:01:32.909> them<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and then choosing between them so it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
and then choosing between them so it
takes<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.650> prep<00:01:34.860> work<00:01:34.890> unless<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
takes a little prep work unless of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
takes a little prep work unless of
course<00:01:36.180> there's<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:37.159> shortcut<00:01:38.159> bar<00:01:38.460> or

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
course there's a shortcut bar or

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
course there's a shortcut bar or
something<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.240> designed<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.320> hard

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
something that's designed for the hard

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
something that's designed for the hard
buttons<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:41.189> maybe<00:01:41.610> something<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.150> I'm

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
buttons or maybe something that I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.499 
buttons or maybe something that I'm
missing<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> idea<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:45.110> slammed

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
missing so the idea here is slammed

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
missing so the idea here is slammed
eventually<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:48.630> rewire<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.729> where<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
eventually maybe rewire this to where it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.889 
eventually maybe rewire this to where it
goes<00:01:51.060> underneath<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> glove<00:01:51.720> compartment

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
goes underneath the glove compartment

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
goes underneath the glove compartment
get<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.470> cable<00:01:52.890> extenders<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.340> whatnot

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
