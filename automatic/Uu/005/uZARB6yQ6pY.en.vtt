good<00:00:00.480> morning<00:00:00.780> again<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.290> Dwayne<00:00:01.530> and

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
good morning again this is Dwayne and

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.360 
good morning again this is Dwayne and
today<00:00:02.010> I'd<00:00:02.190> like<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.429> talk<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.330> tritone

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
today I'd like to talk about the tritone

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.160 
today I'd like to talk about the tritone
substitution<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.520> tritone<00:00:05.850> has<00:00:06.810> been<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
substitution the tritone has been a

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.440 
substitution the tritone has been a
mysterious<00:00:07.859> concept<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.700> hundreds<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.179> years

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
mysterious concept for hundreds of years

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.030 
mysterious concept for hundreds of years
but<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.870> really<00:00:10.080> simple<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> lot

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
but it's really simple it's like a lot

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.189 
but it's really simple it's like a lot
of<00:00:11.160> things<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.550> life<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.420> reality<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
of things in life the the reality of it

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.400 
of things in life the the reality of it
is<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.500> simple<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.660> looks<00:00:18.660> complex<00:00:19.260> on

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
is very simple but it looks complex on

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230 
is very simple but it looks complex on
the<00:00:19.500> outside<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.550> don't<00:00:20.760> let<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> scare

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the outside and so don't let it scare

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.970 
the outside and so don't let it scare
you<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.900> years<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.289> didn't<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.740> I'd

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you for years I didn't know what I'd

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500 
you for years I didn't know what I'd
heard<00:00:23.220> about<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.519> tritone<00:00:23.910> substitution<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
heard about the tritone substitution I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.279 
heard about the tritone substitution I
don't<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> was

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
don't know what it was

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
don't know what it was
I<00:00:25.320> discovered<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.310> I'd<00:00:26.490> probably<00:00:26.699> been

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
I discovered that I'd probably been

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
I discovered that I'd probably been
using<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.570> 20<00:00:27.990> years<00:00:28.199> before<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.619> knew<00:00:28.859> what

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
using it for 20 years before I knew what

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.380 
using it for 20 years before I knew what
the<00:00:29.519> word<00:00:29.550> meant<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.040> may<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.550> using

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the word meant so and you may be using

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
the word meant so and you may be using
it<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.829> tritone<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.079> simply<00:00:37.219> three

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it as well a tritone is simply three

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.330 
it as well a tritone is simply three
whole<00:00:38.430> steps<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:39.559> from<00:00:40.559> any<00:00:40.710> given<00:00:41.070> note<00:00:41.219> in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
whole steps from from any given note in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
whole steps from from any given note in
other<00:00:41.430> words<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:42.120> seven<00:00:42.660> booked<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.410> isn't<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
other words all seven booked see isn't a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
other words all seven booked see isn't a
another<00:00:44.340> whole<00:00:44.520> step<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> e<00:00:45.180> another<00:00:46.140> whole

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
another whole step is e another whole

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.389 
another whole step is e another whole
step<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> f-sharp

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
step is f-sharp

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670 
step is f-sharp
so<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.120> C<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> yeah<00:00:48.899> sure<00:00:49.110> I've<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.379> called<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so for C it yeah sure I've just called a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
so for C it yeah sure I've just called a
tritone<00:00:50.039> back<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> Middle<00:00:51.420> Ages<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.899> was

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
tritone back in the Middle Ages that was

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.850 
tritone back in the Middle Ages that was
considered<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> oh<00:00:54.020> not<00:00:55.020> exactly<00:00:55.170> evil

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
considered kind of oh not exactly evil

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
considered kind of oh not exactly evil
but<00:00:56.100> certainly<00:00:56.550> unlucky<00:00:57.030> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.570> at

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
but certainly unlucky kind of like at

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
but certainly unlucky kind of like at
number<00:00:57.989> 13<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
number 13 probably because of the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.290 
number 13 probably because of the
dissonance<00:01:00.949> between<00:01:01.949> those<00:01:02.340> two<00:01:02.609> notes<00:01:02.820> okay

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
dissonance between those two notes okay

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
dissonance between those two notes okay
but<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.199> useful<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.250> comes<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but it's very useful when it comes to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.219 
but it's very useful when it comes to
course<00:01:05.970> substitutions<00:01:06.689> let's<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
course substitutions let's take that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
course substitutions let's take that
let's<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> chord<00:01:08.250> progression<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.700> g7

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 

it's<00:01:15.030> someone's<00:01:15.390> standard<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:15.990> chord

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's someone's standard of all chord

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's someone's standard of all chord
progressions<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.850> 5<00:01:18.390> chord<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.710> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
progressions right a 5 chord going to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.330 
progressions right a 5 chord going to
alone<00:01:20.159> okay<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> 5<00:01:22.770> chord<00:01:23.159> we're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
alone okay now for that 5 chord we're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
alone okay now for that 5 chord we're
going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> substitute<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.330> court<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
going to substitute the court that's a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.980 
going to substitute the court that's a
tritone<00:01:25.950> below

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
tritone below

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
tritone below
what's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> tritone<00:01:28.710> below<00:01:29.039> below<00:01:29.490> G<00:01:29.789> there's<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
what's a tritone below below G there's a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
what's a tritone below below G there's a
whole<00:01:31.020> step<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.799> whole<00:01:32.130> step

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
whole step is a whole step

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.820 
whole step is a whole step
there's<00:01:32.970> another<00:01:33.210> whole<00:01:33.450> step<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.960> D<00:01:34.229> flat<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
there's another whole step so D flat is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.820 
there's another whole step so D flat is
a<00:01:35.149> tritone<00:01:36.149> below<00:01:37.110> below<00:01:37.920> G<00:01:38.310> ok<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.830> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
a tritone below below G ok now the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.130 
a tritone below below G ok now the
secret<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.909> finding<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> 3rd<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
secret to this is finding the 3rd and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
secret to this is finding the 3rd and
the<00:01:43.170> 7th<00:01:43.679> of<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.070> original<00:01:44.580> court<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.119> other

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the 7th of the original court in other

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.350 
the 7th of the original court in other
words<00:01:45.450> here's<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> G<00:01:46.200> 7th<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:47.149> there's<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
words here's the G 7th or there's the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
words here's the G 7th or there's the
room<00:01:48.600> there's<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> 3rd<00:01:49.319> that's<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> fifth

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
room there's the 3rd that's the fifth

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
room there's the 3rd that's the fifth
and<00:01:50.369> there's<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> south<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.140> 3rd<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and there's the south so the 3rd is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
and there's the south so the 3rd is
there<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> 7th<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.119> those<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
there and the 7th is there those are the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.639 
there and the 7th is there those are the
two<00:01:55.350> key<00:01:56.209> notes<00:01:57.209> or<00:01:57.539> keys<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.990> need<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> keep<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
two key notes or keys we need to keep in

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.149 
two key notes or keys we need to keep in
mind<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.929> what<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.319> third<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.069> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
mind because what the third is of the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.889 
key of G becomes a 7th in the key of D
flat<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:07.080> what<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.439> 7th<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.899> 7th

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
flat and what the 7th is in the 7th

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.490 
flat and what the 7th is in the 7th
chord<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.950> 3rd<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> key<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.150> D<00:02:12.420> flat

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
chord is the 3rd and the key of D flat

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.839 
chord is the 3rd and the key of D flat
okay<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.890> other<00:02:13.980> words<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.610> best

we got to find the third which is f
sharp<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.870> seventh<00:03:54.320> would<00:03:54.470> you<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.950> if

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
sharp and the seventh would you see if

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.880 
sharp and the seventh would you see if
you<00:03:56.390> put<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.750> seventh<00:03:57.140> down<00:03:57.260> here

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
you put the seventh down here

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.580 
you put the seventh down here
okay<00:03:58.730> now<00:03:58.940> not<00:03:59.300> just<00:03:59.330> reverse<00:03:59.870> that<00:03:59.900> if<00:04:00.320> that's

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
okay now not just reverse that if that's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.160 
okay now not just reverse that if that's
the<00:04:00.770> third<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.790> seventh<00:04:02.270> of<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.450> D<00:04:02.690> chord

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
the third and the seventh of the D chord

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.600 
the third and the seventh of the D chord
what<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.460> seventh<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.300> third<00:04:05.540> of

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
what is it the seventh and the third of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:18.000 
what is it the seventh and the third of
some<00:04:07.610> other<00:04:07.760> well<00:04:08.450> it's<00:04:08.960> be<00:04:09.200> half<00:04:09.410> step<00:04:09.680> above

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.100 

so<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.100> other<00:04:19.190> words<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.730> flat<00:04:20.299> seventh<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:20.959> be

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
so in other words a flat seventh can be

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:30.119 
so in other words a flat seventh can be
the<00:04:21.230> substitute<00:04:21.620> as<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.190> go<00:04:22.340> from<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:24.140> D

you can slide in in other words like

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.920 
you can slide in in other words like
that<00:04:32.719> okay<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.879> if<00:04:34.879> you're<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.330> C<00:04:35.509> seventh

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
that okay and if you're the C seventh

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.640 
that okay and if you're the C seventh
floor<00:04:36.669> again<00:04:37.669> let's<00:04:37.909> let's<00:04:38.210> just<00:04:38.270> do<00:04:38.569> it<00:04:38.650> the

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.860 
third of the C seventh chord is e the
seventh<00:04:42.110> is<00:04:42.340> B<00:04:43.340> flat<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.300> let's<00:04:44.479> reverse<00:04:44.840> that

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
seventh is B flat so let's reverse that

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.029 
seventh is B flat so let's reverse that
and<00:04:45.400> in<00:04:46.400> these<00:04:46.729> course<00:04:47.479> substitution<00:04:48.139> that

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
and in these course substitution that

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.010 
and in these course substitution that
we're<00:04:49.189> going<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.370> use<00:04:49.580> G<00:04:49.999> flat<00:04:52.599> seven<00:04:53.599> so<00:04:53.870> if

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
we're going to use G flat seven so if

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.559 
we're going to use G flat seven so if
you<00:04:54.139> want<00:04:54.319> to<00:04:54.379> go<00:04:54.469> from<00:04:54.620> C<00:04:54.949> seven<00:05:00.909> sharp<00:05:01.909> it's

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
you want to go from C seven sharp it's

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.499 
you want to go from C seven sharp it's
in<00:05:02.750> our<00:05:02.960> money<00:05:03.520> again<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.669> concept<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.360> not

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
in our money again the concept is not

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.439 
in our money again the concept is not
hard<00:05:05.960> it's<00:05:06.139> it's<00:05:06.439> a<00:05:06.560> little<00:05:06.710> hard<00:05:07.219> to<00:05:07.449> describe

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
hard it's it's a little hard to describe

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.420 
hard it's it's a little hard to describe
because<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.469> inversion<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.219> third

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
because of the inversion of the third

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.219 
because of the inversion of the third
and<00:05:10.639> seventh<00:05:10.969> but<00:05:11.150> think<00:05:11.599> about<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.990> for<00:05:12.169> a

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
and seventh but think about that for a

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.629 
and seventh but think about that for a
while<00:05:12.259> and<00:05:12.590> try<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.860> out<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.310> think<00:05:13.340> you'll

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
while and try it out and I think you'll

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.399 
while and try it out and I think you'll
find<00:05:13.849> it<00:05:14.029> very<00:05:14.240> useful<00:05:14.300> it's<00:05:14.719> a<00:05:14.840> it's<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.199> nice

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
find it very useful it's a it's a nice

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.529 
find it very useful it's a it's a nice
coarse<00:05:16.219> substitution<00:05:16.789> that<00:05:16.909> you<00:05:17.000> can<00:05:17.150> use<00:05:17.360> in

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
coarse substitution that you can use in

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.839 
coarse substitution that you can use in
a<00:05:17.599> lot<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.810> settings<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:18.919> it<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:19.639> adds

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
a lot of settings and it just adds

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.700 
a lot of settings and it just adds
interest<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.569> excitement<00:05:20.839> to<00:05:21.139> your<00:05:21.259> piano
