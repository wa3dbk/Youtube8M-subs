with my technique sort of via that's the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
rudiments of Scottish drumming Scottish

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.450 
rudiments of Scottish drumming Scottish
and<00:00:54.690> Swiss<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.620> American<00:00:56.039> rudiments<00:00:56.399> as

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and Swiss and some American rudiments as

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
and Swiss and some American rudiments as
well<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> whole<00:00:57.629> nother<00:00:57.840> world<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
well but there's a whole nother world of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.750 
well but there's a whole nother world of
technique<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> Scottish

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
technique that I think that Scottish

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
technique that I think that Scottish
OMERS<00:01:00.149> own<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> feel<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> total<00:01:01.350> thief

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
OMERS own and I feel like a total thief

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
OMERS own and I feel like a total thief
because<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.129> done<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> taken

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
because all I've really done is taken

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.310 
because all I've really done is taken
some<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> rudiments<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> technique

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
some of the rudiments and the technique

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
some of the rudiments and the technique
and<00:01:04.619> used<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> vehicle<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.119> better<00:01:06.540> my

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and used it as a vehicle to better my

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
and used it as a vehicle to better my
playing<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> true<00:01:09.240> player

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
playing I think to be a true player

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
playing I think to be a true player
though<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.840> need<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.290> play<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> van't<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
though you need to play in a van't you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
though you need to play in a van't you
need<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> understand<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> music<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
need to understand the music it's like

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
need to understand the music it's like
it's<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.049> trying<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> play<00:01:13.680> jazz<00:01:14.040> without

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it's like trying to play jazz without

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's like trying to play jazz without
ever<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> gig<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> playing<00:01:16.200> with

ever going out on a gig and playing with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.950 
ever going out on a gig and playing with
an<00:01:16.439> upright<00:01:16.799> player<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> piano<00:01:17.490> player

for<00:01:21.689> me<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> said<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> been<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.920> been<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
for me like I said it's been it's been a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
for me like I said it's been it's been a
way<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.549> me<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> investigate<00:01:24.360> my<00:01:24.689> hands<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
way for me to investigate my hands and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
way for me to investigate my hands and
technique<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> what's<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.880> I've

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
technique and what's going on and I've

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
technique and what's going on and I've
learned<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.479> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.560> great<00:01:28.740> things<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.159> I'm

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
learned a lot of great things that I'm

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
learned a lot of great things that I'm
still<00:01:29.549> trying<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> translate<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
still trying to get to translate to the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
still trying to get to translate to the
drum<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.140> world<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> little<00:01:31.799> different

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
drum set world it's a little different

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
drum set world it's a little different
than<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.310> playing<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
than just playing time but it's it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
than just playing time but it's it's
been<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.850> great<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.270> spend

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
been a it's a really great way to spend

00:01:36.600 --> 00:02:00.520 
been a it's a really great way to spend
hours<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.110> hours<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> practice<00:01:37.920> pad

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.499 

the<00:02:00.979> grip<00:02:01.219> that<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.429> use<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:01.999> funny<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.329> even

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
the grip that I use it's funny to even

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.969 
the grip that I use it's funny to even
call<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.869> grip<00:02:03.079> because<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:03.679> more<00:02:03.829> of<00:02:03.890> a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
call it a grip because it's more of a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.130 
call it a grip because it's more of a
position<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:04.700> think<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.179> grip<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.929> almost

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
position I think that grip is almost

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.589 
position I think that grip is almost
misleading<00:02:06.740> because<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.009> implies<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:08.509> know

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
misleading because it implies you know

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.630 
misleading because it implies you know
squeezing<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> stick<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.799> you<00:02:10.519> know

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
squeezing the stick and you know

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.729 
squeezing the stick and you know
everything<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.239> do<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> tempt<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.410> be<00:02:12.500> very

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
everything that I do I tempt to be very

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.610 
everything that I do I tempt to be very
loose<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.660> lot<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.690> people<00:02:15.019> trade<00:02:15.260> play

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
loose and a lot of people trade play

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.900 
loose and a lot of people trade play
traditional<00:02:16.160> grip<00:02:16.310> sort<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.700> what<00:02:16.790> their

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
traditional grip sort of what their

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.640 
traditional grip sort of what their
thumb<00:02:17.120> up<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.569> they<00:02:17.720> they<00:02:17.989> exercise<00:02:18.470> their

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
thumb up and they they exercise their

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.240 
thumb up and they they exercise their
fingers<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.760> play<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.299> with<00:02:20.980> my<00:02:21.980> thumb

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
fingers but I play more with my thumb

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.050 
fingers but I play more with my thumb
and<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.540> also<00:02:23.810> gives<00:02:24.019> me<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.230> much<00:02:25.190> broader

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
and it also gives me a much broader

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.119 
and it also gives me a much broader
range<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.540> motion<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.290> when<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:27.890> want<00:02:28.069> to

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
range of motion I think when I want to
