percent<00:01:39.630> less<00:01:40.200> energy<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
percent less energy which is about a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.410 
percent less energy which is about a
hundred<00:01:42.119> dollars<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.110> year<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:44.189> 661<00:01:44.970> dollars<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
hundred dollars a year or 661 dollars a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.389 
hundred dollars a year or 661 dollars a
year<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.780> you'll<00:01:45.930> say<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.439> you'll<00:01:46.590> save<00:01:46.860> if

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
year that you'll say that you'll save if

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.170 
year that you'll say that you'll save if
you<00:01:47.579> put<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.180> five<00:01:48.509> lamps<00:01:49.759> 61<00:01:50.759> dollars<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you put this in five lamps 61 dollars a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
you put this in five lamps 61 dollars a
year<00:01:51.390> x<00:01:51.750> 10<00:01:51.960> years<00:01:52.200> 610<00:01:53.130> de<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.610> even

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
year x 10 years 610 de so you don't even

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.270 
year x 10 years 610 de so you don't even
need<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.450> serious<00:01:55.110> math<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.040> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
need to do that serious math but but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.620 
need to do that serious math but but
this<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:57.149> saying<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
this is it you're saying this is a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.319 
this is it you're saying this is a
game-changer<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> cost<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.149> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
game-changer this is now the cost is so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.090 
game-changer this is now the cost is so
low<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
low if you don't have to go to the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
low if you don't have to go to the
checkout<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.909> say<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.210> spending<00:02:03.600> 25<00:02:04.229> bucks

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.490 
checkout and say I'm spending 25 bucks
on<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> light<00:02:05.070> bulb<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:07.290> got

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
on a light bulb right right and it's got

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
on a light bulb right right and it's got
its<00:02:07.950> got<00:02:08.129> exclusive<00:02:08.610> technology<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.599> what

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
its got exclusive technology so what

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.260 
its got exclusive technology so what
they<00:02:09.869> call<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.920> Cree<00:02:11.310> filament

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
they call it is the the Cree filament

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.210 
they call it is the the Cree filament
Tower

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
Tower

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
Tower
so<00:02:13.430> what<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.390> got<00:02:14.540> LEDs<00:02:15.020> all<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so what this is is it's got LEDs all the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.800 
so what this is is it's got LEDs all the
way<00:02:15.680> around<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.210> going<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> emit

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
way around this so it's going to emit

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.660 
way around this so it's going to emit
from<00:02:17.960> all<00:02:18.170> sides<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.070> other<00:02:19.190> complain

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
from all sides that's the other complain

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.090 
from all sides that's the other complain
about<00:02:19.820> LEDs<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.780> don't<00:02:21.050> look<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.590> light

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
about LEDs they don't look like light

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.710 
about LEDs they don't look like light
bulbs<00:02:22.430> right<00:02:22.670> right<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.330> they<00:02:23.570> don't

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
bulbs right right and they don't

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
bulbs right right and they don't
necessarily<00:02:23.960> emit<00:02:24.800> evenly<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.880> so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
necessarily emit evenly and so on and so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.450 
necessarily emit evenly and so on and so
forth<00:02:26.030> they<00:02:26.690> do<00:02:26.750> look<00:02:27.050> odd<00:02:27.230> some<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.710> them<00:02:27.830> well

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
forth they do look odd some of them well

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.640 
forth they do look odd some of them well
this<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.940> designed<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.990> look<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.470> like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
this one is designed to look just like

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.980 
this one is designed to look just like
the<00:02:30.920> bulb<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.570> used<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
the bulb that you are used to the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.160 
the bulb that you are used to the
incandescent<00:02:33.650> you're<00:02:34.100> used<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
incandescent you're used to so the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.290 
incandescent you're used to so the
technology<00:02:37.010> has<00:02:37.040> made<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.430> great<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.910> it's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
technology has made this great and it's

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.010 
technology has made this great and it's
actually<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.790> shatter<00:02:41.090> proof<00:02:41.210> that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
actually the shatter proof that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.380 
actually the shatter proof that
certainly<00:02:42.320> homes<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.370> crack<00:02:43.730> but<00:02:44.270> it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
certainly homes it can crack but it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.580 
certainly homes it can crack but it's
got<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.840> could<00:02:44.960> feel<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.410> got<00:02:45.560> a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
got it you could feel it it's got a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.100 
got it you could feel it it's got a
rubber<00:02:45.800> shroud<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.580> oh<00:02:46.760> yeah<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.450> its<00:02:47.780> it's

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
rubber shroud on it oh yeah so its it's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.600 
rubber shroud on it oh yeah so its it's
stuck<00:02:48.230> together<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.920> it'll<00:02:49.070> still<00:02:49.370> stick

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
stuck together so it'll still stick

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.210 
stuck together so it'll still stick
together<00:02:49.760> even<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.600> cracks<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.920> then<00:02:52.070> what

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
together even if it cracks and then what

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.650 
together even if it cracks and then what
I<00:02:52.250> did<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.610> set<00:02:52.790> up<00:02:52.880> two<00:02:53.030> lamps<00:02:53.360> two

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
I did is I set up two lamps two

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.840 
I did is I set up two lamps two
identical<00:02:54.200> lamps<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:55.430> 60-watt

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
identical lamps this is your 60-watt

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.750 
identical lamps this is your 60-watt
incandescent<00:02:56.140> your<00:02:57.140> 60<00:02:57.650> watt<00:02:57.830> cree<00:02:58.520> light

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
incandescent your 60 watt cree light

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.340 
incandescent your 60 watt cree light
bulb<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.209> can<00:02:59.390> see<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.230> bit

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
bulb you can see it's a little bit

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370 
bulb you can see it's a little bit
brighter<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.340> same<00:03:01.640> color<00:03:02.380> that's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
brighter but it's the same color that's

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.350 
brighter but it's the same color that's
another<00:03:03.830> complaint<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.430> folks<00:03:04.880> had<00:03:05.120> that's

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
another complaint that folks had that's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.380 
another complaint that folks had that's
now<00:03:05.570> out<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.959> window<00:03:06.260> sure<00:03:06.590> sure<00:03:07.270> when<00:03:08.270> you

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
now out the window sure sure when you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.000 
now out the window sure sure when you
move<00:03:08.570> how<00:03:09.020> they<00:03:09.200> dim<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.470> lights<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:09.830> great

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
move how they dim the lights it's great

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.300 
move how they dim the lights it's great
it's<00:03:10.850> mood<00:03:11.030> lighting<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.510> us<00:03:11.630> yeah<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:13.220> you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it's mood lighting for us yeah but you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.370 
it's mood lighting for us yeah but you
can<00:03:13.459> see<00:03:13.610> it's<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> same<00:03:14.060> same<00:03:14.540> soft<00:03:15.050> color

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
can see it's the same same soft color

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.600 
can see it's the same same soft color
that<00:03:15.590> you're<00:03:15.709> used<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.190> an<00:03:16.310> incandescent

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
that you're used to with an incandescent

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.150 
that you're used to with an incandescent
and<00:03:17.090> again<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:18.050> just<00:03:18.350> perfect<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:19.070> a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
and again it's just perfect and it's a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.710 
and again it's just perfect and it's a
little<00:03:19.459> bit<00:03:19.580> brighter<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.420> about<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
little bit brighter and think about it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.479 
little bit brighter and think about it
it's<00:03:20.840> using<00:03:21.230> eighty-five<00:03:21.890> percent<00:03:22.100> less

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
it's using eighty-five percent less

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's using eighty-five percent less
energy<00:03:23.000> than<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.660> dimmer<00:03:23.930> bulb<00:03:24.230> right<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:24.700> it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
energy than a dimmer bulb right now it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.570 
energy than a dimmer bulb right now it's
so<00:03:25.940> interesting<00:03:26.239> because<00:03:26.620> again<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:28.070> this

affordable they're going to use more

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.840 
affordable they're going to use more
energy<00:03:47.930> than<00:03:48.290> an<00:03:48.440> LED<00:03:48.769> but<00:03:49.340> they're<00:03:49.489> full<00:03:49.730> of

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
energy than an LED but they're full of

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.330 
energy than an LED but they're full of
mercury<00:03:50.330> gases<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.470> they're<00:03:51.650> horrible<00:03:52.190> for

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
mercury gases so they're horrible for

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860 
mercury gases so they're horrible for
the<00:03:52.430> environment<00:03:52.640> if<00:03:52.970> they<00:03:53.060> break<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.570> you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the environment if they break and you

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.710 
the environment if they break and you
actually<00:03:54.140> have<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.440> recycle<00:03:54.799> those<00:03:55.070> by<00:03:55.370> law

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
this one no mercury no chemicals it's

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.479 
this one no mercury no chemicals it's
just<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.120> no<00:03:59.239> an<00:03:59.750> LED<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.560> it's<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:00.890> electric

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
just a no an LED so it's just electric

again you said if you do it in five
lights<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.959> math<00:04:09.200> makes<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.769> much<00:04:09.920> sense

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
lights the math makes so much sense

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.620 
lights the math makes so much sense
