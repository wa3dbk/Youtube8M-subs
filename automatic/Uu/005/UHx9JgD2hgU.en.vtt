00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
you don't bust out of them when your

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.629 
you don't bust out of them when your
feet<00:03:40.340> start<00:03:40.609> as<00:03:40.790> well<00:03:41.000> that<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.680> go<00:03:42.919> with<00:03:43.129> a

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
feet start as well that you go with a

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.509 
feet start as well that you go with a
little<00:03:43.970> bit<00:03:44.090> extra<00:03:44.299> room<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.780> there<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:46.370> can

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.170 
they're not a waterproof boot obviously
but<00:04:06.919> I<00:04:06.949> think<00:04:07.040> they're<00:04:07.669> going<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.879> keep<00:04:08.000> your

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
but I think they're going to keep your

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.649 
but I think they're going to keep your
feet<00:04:08.359> dry<00:04:08.479> in<00:04:08.720> most<00:04:08.930> conditions<00:04:10.389> as<00:04:11.389> far<00:04:11.569> as

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
feet dry in most conditions as far as

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.539 
feet dry in most conditions as far as
the<00:04:11.750> insole<00:04:12.139> goes<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.709> think<00:04:12.949> it<00:04:13.040> does<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.220> job

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
the insole goes I think it does the job

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.339 
the insole goes I think it does the job
to<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.269> best<00:04:14.359> of<00:04:14.659> its<00:04:14.810> ability

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
to the best of its ability

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.680 
to the best of its ability
if<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.650> already<00:04:16.039> have<00:04:16.370> foot<00:04:16.639> problems<00:04:16.789> and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
if you already have foot problems and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.210 
if you already have foot problems and
it's<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:17.989> going<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.199> work<00:04:18.349> miracles<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:18.889> you

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
it's not going to work miracles for you

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.409 
it's not going to work miracles for you
it's<00:04:19.400> still<00:04:19.579> going<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.789> have<00:04:19.880> some<00:04:20.090> stiffness

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
it's still going to have some stiffness

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.170 
it's still going to have some stiffness
but<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:20.989> an<00:04:21.139> improvement<00:04:21.500> over<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.889> standard

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
but it is an improvement over a standard

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.219 
but it is an improvement over a standard
insole<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.210> found<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.720> these<00:04:23.870> were<00:04:23.930> more

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
insole I found that these were more

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.350 
insole I found that these were more
comfortable<00:04:24.770> than<00:04:24.979> my<00:04:25.130> bates<00:04:25.370> boots<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
comfortable than my bates boots that you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.860 
comfortable than my bates boots that you
know<00:04:26.870> usually<00:04:27.229> wear<00:04:27.849> if<00:04:28.849> you<00:04:28.969> have<00:04:29.180> normal

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
know usually wear if you have normal

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.149 
know usually wear if you have normal
healthy<00:04:30.139> feet<00:04:30.320> then<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.680> think<00:04:30.889> you're<00:04:31.010> going

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
healthy feet then I think you're going

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.550 
healthy feet then I think you're going
to

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.230 
to
she<00:04:31.710> ate<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.980> extra<00:04:32.400> how<00:04:32.639> they<00:04:32.760> got<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.030> dogs

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
she ate the extra how they got the dogs

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.080 
she ate the extra how they got the dogs
dogs<00:04:33.810> like<00:04:34.020> them<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.350> read<00:04:34.620> Connie<00:04:34.940> if<00:04:35.940> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
dogs like them to read Connie if you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.909 
dogs like them to read Connie if you
have<00:04:36.210> normal<00:04:36.330> healthy<00:04:36.780> feet<00:04:37.020> then<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.620> think

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
have normal healthy feet then I think

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.120 
have normal healthy feet then I think
you're<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> benefit<00:04:38.669> from<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.860> extra

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
you're going to benefit from the extra

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.090 
you're going to benefit from the extra
support<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.760> think<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.480> to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
support and I think it's just going to

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.440 
support and I think it's just going to
prevent<00:04:44.100> foot<00:04:44.340> problems<00:04:44.820> further<00:04:45.090> down<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
prevent foot problems further down the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.600 
prevent foot problems further down the
road<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.260> may<00:04:46.590> not<00:04:46.740> appreciate<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.400> at<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
road so you may not appreciate it at the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.659 
road so you may not appreciate it at the
time<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.350> over<00:04:49.350> days<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.250> weeks<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.610> months

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
time but over days and weeks and months

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.700 
time but over days and weeks and months
you're<00:04:51.060> going<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.360> glad<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.630> having<00:04:52.110> that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
you're going to be glad of having that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.730 
you're going to be glad of having that
extra<00:04:52.980> support<00:04:53.250> in<00:04:53.610> there<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.380> that's<00:04:55.380> one

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
extra support in there and that's one

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.170 
extra support in there and that's one
less<00:04:55.950> thing<00:04:55.980> you<00:04:56.160> have<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.490> worry<00:04:56.700> about<00:04:56.790> is

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
less thing you have to worry about is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.180 
less thing you have to worry about is
aching<00:04:57.750> feet<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.500> think<00:04:58.770> they're<00:04:59.010> great

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
aching feet so I think they're great

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
days of dirt then they begin to match

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.469 
days of dirt then they begin to match
