for<00:02:18.870> example<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.349> using<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.680> big-ass

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
for example you're using a big-ass

for example you're using a big-ass

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.819 
monitor and a different resolution
changed<00:02:22.859> change<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.629> monitors<00:02:25.230> to

the<00:02:25.859> same<00:02:26.370> resolution<00:02:26.969> that<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.299> trying

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
the same resolution that you're trying

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.190 
the same resolution that you're trying
to<00:02:27.719> use<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.859> ghost<00:02:29.250> recon<00:02:29.400> supports<00:02:30.079> 1920<00:02:31.079> by

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to use so ghost recon supports 1920 by

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.839 
to use so ghost recon supports 1920 by
1080<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.609> it<00:02:32.760> changed<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.510> 1920<00:02:34.170> by<00:02:34.260> 1080

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849
