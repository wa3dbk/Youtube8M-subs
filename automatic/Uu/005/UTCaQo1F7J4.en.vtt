00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.079
 Expert I want to talk about today 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.410
 smartphone lg optimus l9 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.759
 I just want to talk about his dignity 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.309
 in childhood on the shortcomings in 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.230
 characteristic will not give up much 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.330
 since there are many video sites which 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.930
 you can see it all yourself and 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.040
 discover 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.710
 I will tell you simply my opinion that would be 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 would like you to notice before 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.629
 will clean up smartphones or decide 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 Buyer or not 1 is 4 7 inch 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.879
 the display work behind it is good brightness 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.190
 gives good contrast this 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.109
 the transfer is generally wonderful a lot 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.270
 in text 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.030
 This smartphone because you do not 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.110
 very small second what I want 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.240
 pay attention this is body thickness 9 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.000
 and 3 millimeters if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.060
 although it is not the thinnest smartphone but 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.310
 if you take in your hand feel closer 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.320
 OK 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.979
 3 I would like to draw the attention of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.100
 these are keys that respond well to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.579
 touch 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.420
 on pressing it is more accurate so on 5 it 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.729
 good speaker 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.250
 as a conversational speaker such a speaker 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.929
 speakerphone works well without any 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 creeps jerks and things like that also in 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:55.330
 plus and i can make it a good camera 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.280
 like a diet now and her plumage but 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.399
 not new of course worse even a little worse 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.439
 but for video chat it will also go 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.209
 the rear 5 megapixel camera is very 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:11.459
 good flash also can be attributed here 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:14.769
 powerful processor on it is a plus and at least 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.780
 RAM is pretty new so 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.319
 the processor here is a dual core processor with 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.349
 frequency of 1 gigahertz RAM 1 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.859
 fuck that 700 megabytes availability with 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.850
 trifle pretty little well plan right away 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:33.400
 go to the cons of this smartphone 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.459
 first thing 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.049
 mechanical key which often 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.769
 click to close some 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.519
 applications and she pretty annoying this 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.099
 key 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.700
 2 this cafe said little operational 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.769
 only one gigabyte of memory 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 extracts the interface undermines or 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.349
 when many applications are running it 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.280
 starts to slow down like this 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.859
 battery 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.859
 here the declared power is 2000 150 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.840
 milliampere hours but it lasts about 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.579
 on a day of easy use to you 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 call and myself from which just put 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.819
 the Internet and if it is strong 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.109
 opposite the full load he will sit down somewhere 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:26.560
 hours to 6 no faster on and up to the pros 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:31.079
 I can still carry little internal memory 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.530
 only available 233 I bytes 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.810
 then upstart can also insert a flash drive 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.470
 if you insert a flash drive it is only for 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.949
 multimedia data and flash drive here 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.290
 strangely she will keep the flash drive 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.629
 is in the memory of the phone itself in 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.099
 In general, only 2 33 bytes are available to you 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:56.379
 memory and also forgot to refer to 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.030
 one minus is that 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.129
 erased they are many answers silvery 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.060
 edging the screen or water the camera can 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:10.260
 see here you can see the line bought 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.260
 such a brief overview
