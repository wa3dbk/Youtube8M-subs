00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
really freaked me out actually when I

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.010 
really freaked me out actually when I
first<00:02:26.400> saw<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.910> thought<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> head<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
first saw it I thought what the head is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.890 
first saw it I thought what the head is
that<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:29.340> area<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.150> quite<00:02:30.360> freaky

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that this area really is quite freaky

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
that this area really is quite freaky
and<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.640> under<00:02:32.940> water<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.709> have<00:02:34.920> got<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and it is under water and I have got a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
and it is under water and I have got a
phobia<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.120> underwater<00:02:36.480> sort<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.500> stuff<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:37.920> I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
phobia of underwater sort of stuff so I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.369 
phobia of underwater sort of stuff so I
used<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> actually<00:02:38.430> play<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.120> vesture<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
used to actually play in vesture in the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.619 
used to actually play in vesture in the
smallest<00:02:40.620> resolution<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.640> when<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.269> quest

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
smallest resolution I could when I quest

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.750 
smallest resolution I could when I quest
it<00:02:42.780> here<00:02:42.959> because<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.230> was<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.190> scared

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it here because I was so you know scared

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
it here because I was so you know scared
of<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.000> underwater<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.440> guess<00:02:46.650> that's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
of the underwater but I guess that's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.860 
of the underwater but I guess that's
just<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:47.819> what<00:02:48.150> some<00:02:48.420> people<00:02:48.569> are

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
just you know what some people are

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.600 
just you know what some people are
afraid<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.890> underwater

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
afraid of just the underwater

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
afraid of just the underwater
I<00:02:50.640> believe<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.510> actually<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.840> real<00:02:52.050> phobia

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
I believe it's actually a real phobia

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
I believe it's actually a real phobia
I'm<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.680> too<00:02:52.800> sure<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.220> though<00:02:53.540> so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
I'm not too sure what it is though so
