00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 
seems like someone has orchestrated this

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.020 
seems like someone has orchestrated this
but<00:08:10.560> I<00:08:10.590> can't<00:08:10.890> quite<00:08:11.130> put<00:08:11.340> my<00:08:11.370> finger<00:08:11.520> on<00:08:11.880> it

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.030
