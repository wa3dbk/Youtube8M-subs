00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.470 

good<00:01:27.990> question<00:01:28.380> yes<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:29.340> hurt<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:30.180> mean

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
good question yes will this hurt I mean

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.630 
good question yes will this hurt I mean
was<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.650> ten<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:31.980> I'm<00:01:32.100> potentially

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
was it up with ten that I'm potentially

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.420 
was it up with ten that I'm potentially
be<00:01:32.760> here<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.230> does<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.620> because<00:01:34.890> our<00:01:35.160> club

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
be here well it does it because our club

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.430 
be here well it does it because our club
tube<00:01:35.670> distance<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> down<00:01:36.600> considerably<00:01:37.020> lower

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440

tube distance is down considerably lower
this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.760> lower<00:01:38.940> position<00:01:39.300> than

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
this is actually a lower position than

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
this is actually a lower position than
what<00:01:39.960> most<00:01:40.140> talk<00:01:40.440> tubes<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.980> hooked<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.030> here

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
what most talk tubes are hooked up here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
what most talk tubes are hooked up here
because<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.660> really<00:01:42.870> assists<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.530> ratio<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because it really assists the ratio of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
because it really assists the ratio of
motion<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.970> rear<00:01:45.150> travel<00:01:45.600> suspension<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
motion of the rear travel suspension it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.220 
motion of the rear travel suspension it
