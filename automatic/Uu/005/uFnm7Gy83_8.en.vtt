be<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.200> best<00:02:57.380> thing<00:02:57.620> for<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.880> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
be the best thing for this you have to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.950 
be the best thing for this you have to
be<00:02:59.030> careful<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.510> don't<00:02:59.630> want<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> hit

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
be careful is you don't want to hit

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.050 
be careful is you don't want to hit
anything<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:01.220> go<00:03:01.310> ahead<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.550> pull<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.760> on

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
anything just go ahead and pull that on

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.920 
anything just go ahead and pull that on
out<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:05.360> down<00:03:05.540> there<00:03:05.720> you'll

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
out like that and down there you'll

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.720 
out like that and down there you'll
actually<00:03:06.050> see<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.380> diaphragm<00:03:07.010> I've<00:03:07.580> actually

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
actually see the diaphragm I've actually

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.610 
actually see the diaphragm I've actually
seen<00:03:08.030> these<00:03:08.180> things<00:03:08.330> folded<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.140> kinds<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
seen these things folded in all kinds of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.220 
seen these things folded in all kinds of
ways<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.250> make<00:03:11.150> sure<00:03:11.330> yours<00:03:11.570> looks<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:11.900> that

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
ways and make sure yours looks like that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.290 
ways and make sure yours looks like that
should<00:03:12.440> be<00:03:12.470> nice<00:03:12.740> flat<00:03:13.250> cover<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> whole

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
should be nice flat cover the whole

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.840 
should be nice flat cover the whole
surface<00:03:14.480> I've<00:03:15.140> seen<00:03:15.470> them<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.610> really

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
surface I've seen them it's a really

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.800 
surface I've seen them it's a really
messed<00:03:17.000> up<00:03:17.090> mouth<00:03:17.300> cause<00:03:17.510> problems<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.660> that's

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
messed up mouth cause problems so that's

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.990 
messed up mouth cause problems so that's
that's<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.010> mean<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:22.340> far<00:03:22.430> as<00:03:22.580> December

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
that's it I mean as far as December

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.230 
that's it I mean as far as December
there's<00:03:23.270> nothing<00:03:23.570> else<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.960> this<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:25.970> all

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
there's nothing else to this this is all

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
there's nothing else to this this is all
you've<00:03:26.390> got<00:03:26.420> right<00:03:26.660> here<00:03:26.810> just<00:03:26.990> going<00:03:27.140> to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
you've got right here just going to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.110 
you've got right here just going to
clean<00:03:27.470> everything<00:03:27.590> up<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.360> regress<00:03:29.360> it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
clean everything up and regress it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.750 
clean everything up and regress it
sometimes<00:03:33.070> it<00:03:34.070> doesn't<00:03:34.310> matter<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.730> put

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
sometimes it doesn't matter if you put

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.610 
sometimes it doesn't matter if you put
too<00:03:35.000> much<00:03:35.030> grease<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.780> case<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.380> does

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
too much grease in this case it does

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.790 
too much grease in this case it does
matter<00:03:37.330> if<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.630> put<00:03:38.870> too<00:03:39.110> much<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.650> will

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
matter if you put too much it will

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.360 
matter if you put too much it will
actually<00:03:40.540> cause<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.930> hub<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:43.010> be<00:03:43.190> able<00:03:43.280> to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
actually cause the hub to not be able to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.820 
actually cause the hub to not be able to
actually<00:03:43.610> smooth<00:03:44.330> enough<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.900> because

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
actually smooth enough and because

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.830 
actually smooth enough and because
they're<00:03:46.100> x-rayed<00:03:46.490> by<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.730> vacuum<00:03:47.090> pulse<00:03:47.540> that's

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
they're x-rayed by a vacuum pulse that's

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.980 
they're x-rayed by a vacuum pulse that's
so<00:03:48.020> weak<00:03:48.970> they<00:03:49.970> actually<00:03:50.270> won't<00:03:50.390> engage<00:03:50.780> we

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
so weak they actually won't engage we

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.720 
so weak they actually won't engage we
use<00:03:51.110> too<00:03:51.290> much<00:03:51.440> grease<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:52.490> when<00:03:52.610> you're

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
use too much grease so when you're

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.760 
use too much grease so when you're
filling<00:03:52.910> these<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.330> just<00:03:53.450> want<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.750> just<00:03:54.080> put

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
filling these you just want to just put

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.000 
filling these you just want to just put
a<00:03:54.830> very<00:03:55.100> thin<00:03:55.220> layer<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.560> give<00:03:57.770> it<00:03:57.800> some

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
a very thin layer just to give it some

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.550 
a very thin layer just to give it some
lubrication<00:03:58.520> if<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.600> if<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.990> fill<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.380> too

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
lubrication if you if you fill it too

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.040 
lubrication if you if you fill it too
much<00:04:00.770> I'm<00:04:01.760> telling<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.300> one<00:04:02.510> experience

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
much I'm telling you this one experience

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.830 
much I'm telling you this one experience
it's<00:04:03.710> not<00:04:04.100> going<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.490> actuate<00:04:04.850> because<00:04:05.420> the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
it's not going to actuate because the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.890 
it's not going to actuate because the
parts<00:04:06.200> can't<00:04:06.560> move<00:04:07.010> enough<00:04:07.570> with<00:04:08.570> all<00:04:08.720> that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
parts can't move enough with all that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.510 
parts can't move enough with all that
grease<00:04:09.140> in<00:04:09.290> there<00:04:09.410> create<00:04:09.800> suction<00:04:10.160> and

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
grease in there create suction and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.490 
grease in there create suction and
vacuum<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.120> there's<00:04:11.300> just<00:04:11.450> not<00:04:12.170> enough<00:04:12.230> room

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
vacuum and there's just not enough room

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.060 
vacuum and there's just not enough room
for<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.890> very<00:04:13.100> small<00:04:13.720> vacuum<00:04:14.720> pulse<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.860> move

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
for the very small vacuum pulse to move

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.099 
for the very small vacuum pulse to move
things<00:04:16.370> around<00:04:16.489> so

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
things around so

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.080 
things around so
you<00:04:18.680> just<00:04:18.799> want<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:19.039> give<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.430> very<00:04:19.459> thin

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you just want to give it a very thin

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.020 
you just want to give it a very thin
layer<00:04:20.329> all<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.409> way<00:04:21.530> around<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.159> nothing

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
layer all the way around and nothing

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:33.100 
layer all the way around and nothing
more<00:04:28.689> now<00:04:29.689> this<00:04:29.870> needs<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:31.210> grease<00:04:32.210> inside<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
more now this needs a grease inside and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.610 
more now this needs a grease inside and
outside<00:04:34.569> just<00:04:35.569> throw<00:04:35.810> some<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.080> there<00:04:36.259> work

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
outside just throw some in there work

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.249 
outside just throw some in there work
around<00:04:40.090> again<00:04:41.090> not<00:04:41.300> too<00:04:41.509> much<00:04:41.719> but<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.110> not

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
around again not too much but it's not

00:04:42.259 --> 00:05:01.230 
around again not too much but it's not
as<00:04:42.409> crucial<00:04:42.889> here<00:04:43.099> also<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> outside<00:04:44.689> here

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
enough grease if you do you should slide

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:38.040 
enough grease if you do you should slide
out<00:05:17.690> when<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.139> put<00:05:18.350> in
