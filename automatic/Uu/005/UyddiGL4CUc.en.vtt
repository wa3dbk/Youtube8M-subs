reduced<00:03:53.500> from<00:03:53.620> six<00:03:53.890> pound<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.489> think<00:03:54.670> when

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
reduced from six pound I just think when

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.569 
reduced from six pound I just think when
you<00:03:55.239> get<00:03:55.510> these<00:03:55.720> kind<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.470> little<00:03:56.920> cardigans

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579

you get these kind of little cardigans
they're<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.359> useful<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.320> it's<00:03:59.500> also

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
they're so so useful and that it's also

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.190 
they're so so useful and that it's also
got<00:03:59.950> these<00:04:00.160> kind<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.090> like<00:04:01.359> nice<00:04:01.720> pattern<00:04:02.109> in

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
got these kind of like nice pattern in

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.810 
got these kind of like nice pattern in
it<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:03.070> thought<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.370> would<00:04:03.459> go<00:04:03.640> with

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
it and I just thought it would go with

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.340 
it and I just thought it would go with
most<00:04:04.060> things<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.630> I'm<00:04:04.720> always<00:04:04.840> kind<00:04:05.320> of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
most things and I'm always kind of

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.140 
most things and I'm always kind of
wishing<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.799> have<00:04:05.950> more<00:04:06.100> back<00:04:06.370> jumpers<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
wishing I have more back jumpers and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.479 
wishing I have more back jumpers and
black<00:04:07.269> cardigans<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:07.959> stuff<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:09.340> was<00:04:09.459> my

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
black cardigans and stuff so that was my

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.740 
black cardigans and stuff so that was my
reasoning<00:04:10.030> behind<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:12.420> next<00:04:13.420> thing<00:04:13.600> was

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
reasoning behind that the next thing was

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.240 
reasoning behind that the next thing was
one<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:13.989> those<00:04:14.079> things<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:14.440> meant<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.859> be<00:04:15.040> I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
one of those things that's meant to be I

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.920 
one of those things that's meant to be I
saw<00:04:15.489> some<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.850> these<00:04:15.970> shirt<00:04:16.329> these<00:04:16.630> blouses

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
saw some of these shirt these blouses

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.409 
saw some of these shirt these blouses
and<00:04:17.410> over<00:04:17.799> one<00:04:17.919> side<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.340> shop<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.760> they

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
did not have my size and I thought I'm

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.149 
did not have my size and I thought I'm
in<00:04:22.539> there<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.840> get<00:04:22.930> one<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.680> went<00:04:23.830> across<00:04:23.979> the

in there to get one so I went across the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.409 
in there to get one so I went across the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.619 
was a another top this is quite thick
material<00:04:53.310> like<00:04:53.580> maybe<00:04:53.789> more<00:04:54.030> like<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.210> jumper

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
material like maybe more like a jumper

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.860 
material like maybe more like a jumper
and<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.900> has<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.050> zip<00:04:55.349> at<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.889> back<00:04:56.099> here<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.870> it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
and it has a zip at the back here and it

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.010 
and it has a zip at the back here and it
is<00:04:58.169> um<00:04:58.800> stripy<00:04:59.669> and<00:04:59.969> it's<00:05:00.599> kind<00:05:00.779> of<00:05:00.810> three

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
is um stripy and it's kind of three

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.629 
is um stripy and it's kind of three
quarter<00:05:01.379> length<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.860> quite<00:05:02.069> short<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:02.610> I

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
quarter length it's quite short so I

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.399 
quarter length it's quite short so I
guess<00:05:02.819> maybe<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.090> vest<00:05:03.330> underneath<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:03.900> that
