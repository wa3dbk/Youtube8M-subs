00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
in I suppose first so yeah like I say

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.999 
in I suppose first so yeah like I say
I've<00:02:02.070> adjusted<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:05.460> pumps<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I've adjusted the the pumps and the the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.669 
I've adjusted the the pumps and the the
wave<00:02:08.160> makers<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> flow

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
wave makers just just to get the flow

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.170 
wave makers just just to get the flow
right<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:10.950> am<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.670> everyone's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
right really am and I think everyone's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.250 
right really am and I think everyone's
getting<00:02:12.420> enough<00:02:12.720> flow

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
getting enough flow

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.589 
getting enough flow
and<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:14.069> float<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.459> require<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.120> was<00:02:15.390> any
