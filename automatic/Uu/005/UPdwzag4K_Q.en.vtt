00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello how about youtube friends the day of 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.109
 today we are going to learn to release a jagÃ¼ey 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.360
 that 510 is in the company 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 unefon iusacell which is where 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
 We regularly find these 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.400
 we will release them with our 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.780
 box as well as to box as well as to that the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.570
 know 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.250
 the process is too easy 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 obviously we need the box the equipment 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.890
 preferably USB cable that comes with 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 the box the cable that is connected to the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.960
 box and it occupied the one of the z 3 x more color 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.450
 red maybe 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 why we are not in the program of the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.649
 box as well as that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.820
 and the high-suite program that is where 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 we found the drivers of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.470
 from android up the right link from 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.790
 Download in the hide description 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.830
 suite room 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.830
 very well we connect our box 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.930
 and we proceed to open our application 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.930
 sigma key 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 to which we have open platform is 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.229
 which with our team is a qualcomm 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.540
 paul processor beware of 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
 this because if it is not just not going 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.420
 to leave with our team completely 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.820
 off 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.030
 let's press the volume keyboard 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.310
 less volume more 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.619
 and power has to be completely 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.260
 off since if not how you have a 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.729
 quick start like the alcatel 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.520
 of doing this sequence of tightening the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.409
 buttons will start the software 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.140
 correctly and it will not let us in 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.030
 in download mode 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.390
 then we have to preferably 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.250
 remove the battery put it back on if 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.650
 Loans to press less volume 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 more volume and power is going to give us a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.960
 rose screen 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 what does it mean that it is already in mode 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.590
 download 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 from here we connect it via cable 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.240
 usb to apply the micro usb 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.240
 to our houses 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.300
 our computer is installing 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 drivers 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.980
 to do it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.980
 the port is called weak 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.030
 must adapt adapt interface and when 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.580
 they have it they select it and they give it in giving 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.890
 with what they can do with getting 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.010
 codes but a release is easier 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.569
 direct 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.239
 the software will do all the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.620
 release when you 're ready in our 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.920
 screen of our huawei is going to 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 leave the word ok 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 here we just have to restart it 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.120
 and now we have our huawei 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.120
 released 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.150
 one that already says restarting phone 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.120
 but in this case it does not restart it we have 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.220
 to do a manual reset leaving 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.940
 press the pay button or 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 removing the battery 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.290
 well that's all today's video video 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.900
 very short but very concise 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.780
 thank you very much for watching this video 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.180
 likes you served and share it because 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.730
 Sometimes if it's a bit difficult to fight 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.900
 with the huawei 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.900
