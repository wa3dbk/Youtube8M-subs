 issue news digest avatar 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 technology every monday we 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 tell you about the events that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 occurred a week in high 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 technology in this issue robot cook 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 augmented reality glasses 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 printed on a 3d printer rocket 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.099
 engine and new interesting project 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.809
 darpa let's get a robot cook 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 smartphone driven go to 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 sale already in 2017 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 machines developed by moley 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.449
 robotics can handle virtually any 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 all kitchen utensils skillfully 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.890
 copies the movement of a person 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 MI-24 robots connect 20 motors and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.129
 works as fast as 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.620
 professional chef meekly 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 obeying commands from the iphone is essentially 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 two robotic arms 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.109
 exposed over the stove oven 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 worktop and sink when 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.379
 manipulator they are not used 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 stack with the consumer version 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 the system will have a built-in fridge and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 storeroom in the future manipulators will 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.270
 put all dirty dishes not in the sink 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 and in the dishwasher which 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.690
 it is planned to complete the system 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 the company intends to start mass 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.430
 robot sales in 2017 for the price 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 14 thousand eight hundred dollars at this price 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.120
 includes not only manipulators but also 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 kitchen stove sink work surfaces 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.530
 cabinets of the shanghai auto show will 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 presented the concept of glasses which 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 allow you to see through walls not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 forget about speed and remember the road 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.030
 presentation signs specialized 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.070
 points resembles footage from fantastic 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 films about the future the opportunity to see 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.190
 through the walls getting set 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.270
 information from a small device and when 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.490
 This does not break away from driving 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 car in mini argument from vision 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.690
 many wildest fantasies have come true 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the field of modern devices using 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.790
 display technology on transparent 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 glass 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.660
 augmented reality glasses shows 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 various information in the direct field 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.900
 driver's view and not blocking 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.970
 pictures of road users 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 thereby providing the necessary 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 driving comfort and safety 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 for example the driver can follow 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.530
 speedometer indicators or data 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 current device speed limits 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.159
 facilitates the parking process of broadcasting 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 image from the rear view camera on 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.090
 glasses in this case the distance from 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230
 car to obstacles estimated 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.940
 easier and more accurate 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.750
 glasses has x-ray function 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.580
 kind of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 through some car parts 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.920
 such as the A- pillar or 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 the doors 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.810
 helps the driver to see objects 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.340
 usually in blind spots 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.160
 US Patent and Brand Management 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.260
 gave google a patent on the system 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.940
 and methods for distributing tasks between 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.010
 a large number of robotic 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.530
 devices recall that google at the end 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 2013 bought the company boston 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.630
 dinamix 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.050
 known for its developments in the field 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.970
 robotic machines and at the beginning of 2014 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.290
 google acquired deepmind 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.630
 artificial systems developer 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 intelligence so getting a patent on 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.040
 control army of robots is quite in the spirit 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.810
 existing google strategy 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.550
 it is specified that commands can be transmitted 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 the right amount of machine through 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.030
 centralized point as 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.670
 which can be used remote 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260
 computer or network cloud system 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.540
 also allow you to receive this state 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.400
 robots their willingness to perform that or 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.140
 another problem is mentioned in the patent 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.239
 opportunity to accumulate information about 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.920
 machine problems 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.050
 performance performance set 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.760
 task agency darpa 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.410
 starts a project in which 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.630
 plans to develop software 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.730
 provision that can work a hundred 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.420
 years do not require updates agency 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.790
 promising defense 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.100
 research development usa 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.260
 four years plan to design 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.970
 capable of creating military 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.769
 computer machines that are not 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 will need to stop for carrying 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.040
 software updates that will be 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 adapt to technological 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.840
 change agency has already started receiving 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.299
 proposals for the implementation of the project is the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.829
 promising ideas will form its basis and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.540
 will get funding for 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.790
 further development of New Zealand 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 company roccat paws printed on 3d 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.600
 motor battery printer for 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 booster instead of expensive and complex 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.519
 gas generator engine racerford 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.110
 for a booster electron use 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.920
 small high-performance 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.750
 electric motor and 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.120
 and lithium polymer batteries for power 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.980
 turbo pumps company management 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.870
 claims that 3d printing allows 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 produce complex lightweight structures 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.989
 from materials like titans others 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.790
 alloys 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.530
 it helps to reduce the time 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.540
 assembly from several months to 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.120
 several days and increased availability 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.530
 18 meter carbon components 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.400
 composite booster 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.900
 electron 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.850
 will put satellites into orbit 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.590
 the size of a compact fridge on 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.240
 an altitude of about 500 kilometers above 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.710
 the ground is new 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.360
 reduce cost and increase 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.949
 space launch efficiency 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.780
 on that optimistic note we 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.410
 finish the news review for the last 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.449
