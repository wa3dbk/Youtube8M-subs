00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
it kind of just swells it up even more

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
been injured on some Loki's snare work

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.950 
been injured on some Loki's snare work
trying<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.489> build<00:00:46.969> some<00:00:47.180> rhythm<00:00:47.480> there<00:00:47.719> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
trying to build some rhythm there and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.869 
trying to build some rhythm there and
then<00:00:48.440> also<00:00:48.739> on<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.010> new<00:00:49.250> beat<00:00:49.489> let<00:00:49.670> me<00:00:49.760> show

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
then also on this new beat let me show

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.459 
then also on this new beat let me show
you<00:00:49.969> those<00:00:50.149> two<00:00:50.360> things<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.899> then<00:00:51.110> maybe<00:00:51.410> a

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
you those two things and then maybe a

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.349 
you those two things and then maybe a
couple<00:00:51.680> other<00:00:51.859> things<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.250> come<00:00:52.670> along<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.120> for

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
couple other things to come along so for

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.490 
couple other things to come along so for
this<00:00:53.420> beat<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.899> think<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:54.320> more<00:00:54.440> difficult

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
this beat I think it's more difficult

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.229 
this beat I think it's more difficult
than<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.070> last<00:00:55.219> two<00:00:55.460> I've<00:00:55.609> shown<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.149> my

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
than the last two I've shown you in my

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.450 
than the last two I've shown you in my
previous<00:00:56.449> videos<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.500> basically<00:00:57.680> consists

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
previous videos and basically consists

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.240 
previous videos and basically consists
of<00:00:58.609> three<00:00:58.969> parts<00:00:59.329> just<00:00:59.570> like<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.870> other<00:01:00.019> one

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
of three parts just like the other one

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.680 
of three parts just like the other one
so<00:01:01.250> focus<00:01:01.609> on<00:01:01.640> getting<00:01:01.789> these<00:01:02.030> new<00:01:02.210> parts<00:01:02.510> down

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
so focus on getting these new parts down

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.390 
so focus on getting these new parts down
and<00:01:03.019> then<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:03.379> focus<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.829> putting<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.340> all

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and then you can focus on putting it all

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.340 
and then you can focus on putting it all
together<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.850> then<00:01:05.060> keeping<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.810> continuous

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
together and then keeping it continuous

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.190 
together and then keeping it continuous
or<00:01:06.560> moving<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.160> beat<00:01:07.370> okay<00:01:08.270> part<00:01:08.690> one<00:01:08.900> is

this<00:03:52.770> kind<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.640> guess<00:03:54.240> what<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.050> would<00:03:55.080> do

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
this kind of I guess what you would do

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.200 
this kind of I guess what you would do
I<00:03:55.650> didn't<00:03:56.070> look<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.520> anywhere<00:03:56.910> it's<00:03:57.120> just

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
I didn't look this up anywhere it's just

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.670 
I didn't look this up anywhere it's just
something<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.570> just<00:03:57.630> kind<00:03:57.960> of<00:03:57.990> mess<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:58.230> what

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
something I just kind of mess with what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
something I just kind of mess with what
you're<00:03:58.770> gonna<00:03:58.860> do<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.130> you're<00:03:59.220> gonna<00:03:59.280> get<00:03:59.460> your

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
you're gonna do is you're gonna get your

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940 
you're gonna do is you're gonna get your
you're<00:04:00.210> both<00:04:00.510> drumsticks<00:04:01.050> really<00:04:01.440> low<00:04:01.620> onto

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
you're both drumsticks really low onto

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.380 
you're both drumsticks really low onto
your<00:04:02.100> drum<00:04:02.460> head<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.210> going<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
your drum head and it's just going to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.750 
your drum head and it's just going to
release<00:04:03.810> subtle<00:04:04.460> vibrations<00:04:05.460> you're<00:04:05.610> just

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
release subtle vibrations you're just

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.410 
release subtle vibrations you're just
kind<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.000> gonna<00:04:06.150> tap<00:04:06.740> each<00:04:07.740> stick<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.550> slowly

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
kind of gonna tap each stick on slowly

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.510 
kind of gonna tap each stick on slowly
onto<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> drum<00:04:10.170> head<00:04:10.320> what<00:04:10.980> you'll<00:04:11.100> hear<00:04:11.340> is

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
onto the drum head what you'll hear is

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.670 
onto the drum head what you'll hear is
when<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.910> let<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.600> drop<00:04:12.870> really<00:04:13.260> closely

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
when you let it drop really closely

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.130 
when you let it drop really closely
you'll<00:04:14.670> hear<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.540> couple<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.900> really

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
you'll hear just a couple of really

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.920 
you'll hear just a couple of really
small<00:04:16.650> vibrations<00:04:17.519> couple<00:04:18.359> those<00:04:18.510> together

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
small vibrations couple those together

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.400 
small vibrations couple those together
here's<00:04:19.709> kind<00:04:19.950> of<00:04:20.040> what<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.519> will<00:04:20.580> sound<00:04:20.850> like

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.310 

I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.300> sounds<00:04:26.390> kind<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.720> cool<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.140> maybe

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
I think it sounds kind of cool and maybe

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.730 
I think it sounds kind of cool and maybe
once<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.130> actually<00:04:28.520> learn<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:29.420> song<00:04:30.020> check<00:04:30.620> out

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
once I actually learn a song check out

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.860 
once I actually learn a song check out
my<00:04:30.860> first<00:04:31.040> cover<00:04:31.310> song<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.700> tried<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.360> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
my first cover song I tried in the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.390 
my first cover song I tried in the
previous<00:04:33.260> video<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.860> think<00:04:34.070> once<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.280> get

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
previous video but I think once I get

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.100 
previous video but I think once I get
better<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.820> I'm<00:04:34.880> able<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.180> actually<00:04:35.720> play<00:04:36.080> a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
better and I'm able to actually play a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.910 
better and I'm able to actually play a
complete<00:04:36.500> song<00:04:36.950> that's<00:04:37.340> fairly<00:04:38.180> difficult

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
complete song that's fairly difficult

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.030 
complete song that's fairly difficult
maybe<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.010> can<00:04:40.220> add<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.670> somewhere
