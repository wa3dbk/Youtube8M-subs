00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.640 
and then just showing you the creep mode
so<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.359> all<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.349> what<00:03:22.500> we're

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so this is in all of this for what we're

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.699 
so this is in all of this for what we're
performing<00:03:23.099> right<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.819> actually<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.709> not

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
performing right now is actually in not

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.559 
performing right now is actually in not
fast<00:03:26.010> idle<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:26.849> I'm<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.180> raise<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
fast idle so now I'm going to raise the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.430 
fast idle so now I'm going to raise the
ladder

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.970

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
and that can actually be controlling two

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.760 
and that can actually be controlling two
things<00:03:46.129> at<00:03:46.430> one<00:03:46.640> time

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770
