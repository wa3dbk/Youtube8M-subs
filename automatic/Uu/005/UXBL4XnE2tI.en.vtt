00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.929
 Welcome to a following top 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.380
 I will live five games in which I live 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.630
 want 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.690
 I noticed that I am at the top 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 I play five top 5 I do not live 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.180
 I want to follow said that it already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 such a thing is true 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 not and that's why I thought why 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.929
 I do not have my top five games 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 be out in and out in which I want to live 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.030
 I have manganese on place 5 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.230
 scribblenauts scribblenauts should 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.149
 actually many of you know 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 this game where you just have a word 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.780
 write and what you wrote 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.190
 apparently in front of you you can still do it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 change that she writes for example 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 Elephant pot in front of the elephant 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 Do you write great elephant or great 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 green elephant is just big and green and green 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.559
 yet an elephant and just that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 me in itself if that's the real world 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.629
 that would be pretty awesome because 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 just take out a blog and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.359
 write down that I like something now 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.210
 I know 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.280
 have a private and easy to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 to write to anyone who would be there right away 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 Of course, really awesome and just as 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.100
 game world that would be pretty cool and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.020
 that's why scribblenauts in fifth place 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 in fourth place I have great smash bros 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 brawl that maybe a bit hard 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.170
 to understand because you think now 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.299
 probably to the stage it was 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.040
 just a couple of nintendo 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 give characters on the face 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.329
 but I do not mean this world at all 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 my exactly the other plays namely the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.460
 story of super smash bros brawl and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.439
 thinks this is just evil so goes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 to finish where the whole evil is defeated 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.430
 then you are really one 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.439
 very peaceful extensive world and 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.009
 the best thing about this extensive world 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 that's just all nintendo creatures 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.509
 So now it's all the characters of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.210
 nintendo in this world aloud in the game 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.520
 In other words , that would be the real world 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.930
 you would be a world with all nintendo 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 cartel life 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 you will wieling a same world 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 donkey kong kirby but for a moment 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.410
 would that be the world in which you with 1 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.120
 together 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.640
 A world life has become a view 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.400
 just a super happy and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.320
 non-violent world and therefore super smash 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.970
 Bros brawl the world of the campaign 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.000
 fourth place in third place comes one 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.300
 the world probably the in itself if you 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 this whole story is pure history 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.430
 not so nice 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 that's the world of bioshock 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.880
 However, you do not consider infinite 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.830
 so exactly the point that there is war 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.050
 murder homicide all want to kill themselves 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 Stop the story I do not have any 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.190
 a little bit pointed but you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.390
 know how I mean that that one 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.090
 it is really one of them 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.150
 unbelievably peaceful in itself 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.370
 beautiful world above the clouds 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.990
 I mean when you go over the clouds 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 experienced that means that there consistently 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.860
 Sunshine is there is no bad 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.460
 weather the people are good in themselves 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.130
 everything super clean super nice 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.840
 And on top of everything else, everything is modern 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 although everything is still in this very old one 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.540
 I think 80s style is kept 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.890
 unbelievably awesome and therefore one 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.670
 world in which I really like to live 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.209
 would be bioshock infinite in place 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.990
 two, i have made the world of gehrys 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.240
 On the one hand, of course, one can say 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.740
 Gamespot is not a real world 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.660
 gives all the different maps 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.670
 already, of course, to say it 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 would be even more brilliant if you just like that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.120
 between worlds can change in which one 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.920
 just a new map desk but 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.370
 if we just switch to the normal one 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.680
 web refer speak for example the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.570
 normal stage so flatland where you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.550
 Just what can do is gary shaw 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.320
 nevertheless such a brilliant world in the man 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.020
 You can live because you can do everything yourself 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.730
 You can build one has his fabrics there and 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.940
 You can just get out of it 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260
 Just build it and do everything 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.980
 one wants to be one in this world 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.620
 so to speak, creatures or inhabitants and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.330
 god of this world at the same time that is 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.130
 if it is simply the ruler of everything 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.260
 can determine everything by doing everything yourself 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.360
 and that's why I'm a world 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.930
 would necessarily live 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.930
 gary j 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.510
 then so long on place one I have 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.950
 then something good for me now 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.220
 so hard to guess is because of space 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.190
 One is the world of pokémon red blue 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.410
 and green red we can all 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.820
 the same two are yellow one could 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.070
 theoretically also pure 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.700
 in fact, that sounds like 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.520
 pokémon world of red blue and green and 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.820
 In itself, it is best that it is yellow 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.130
 the slightest war that worries the team 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.780
 but rocket occurs but actually like that 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.389
 good as no power has as good as 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.200
 nothing done and that's why 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.419
 symbolizes this simple game that 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.430
 one in this world full of pokemon 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.800
 just train your own being 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.169
 can build his own pokémon team 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.940
 can and can therefore become stronger and stronger 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.970
 can always accomplish more and more 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.530
 stop the pokémon us to become the 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.540
 to become a Pokémon master 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.490
 I think that's incredible 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.800
 cool and I'm generally such a yes 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.330
 huge pokémon fans and that's why 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.950
 the one world i really great 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.800
 and that's why I would say 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.950
 the world in which I like most 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.940
 actually, pokémon would be red 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.520
 blue green and yellow 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.350
 Well that was this top 5 list I hope 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.160
 you liked it writes in the 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.710
 Comments 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.210
 what top 5 list you still want to see and 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.340
 in which games you like 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.690
 would live me very much 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.130
 interested and how she likes us 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.210
 hopefully next time whatever 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.210
 I'm doing sanchez
