dogs<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.900> canine<00:01:31.320> companions<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
dogs so I think canine companions is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
dogs so I think canine companions is
unique<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.730> abuses<00:01:33.390> Labradors<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
unique in that abuses Labradors go to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.680 
unique in that abuses Labradors go to
between<00:01:34.650> birds<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.980> crosses<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.730> two<00:01:35.880> at

between birds and crosses of the two at
home<00:01:37.230> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.220> where<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.760> hearing<00:01:39.090> dog

human equivalent and that is so nice

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.240 
human equivalent and that is so nice
because<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.300> many<00:03:27.450> ways<00:03:27.690> were<00:03:27.960> able<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.410> relate

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
because in many ways were able to relate

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.040 
because in many ways were able to relate
to<00:03:29.370> each<00:03:29.490> other<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> basis<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.330> watching

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
to each other on the basis of watching

the<00:03:31.170> world<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.680> taking<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.850> at<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the world and taking it in but at the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390 
the world and taking it in but at the
same<00:03:33.180> time<00:03:33.420> we<00:03:33.630> are<00:03:33.720> able<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.050> let<00:03:34.770> go<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.250> have
