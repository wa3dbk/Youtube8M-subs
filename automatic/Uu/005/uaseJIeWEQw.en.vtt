00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990 

I<00:00:00.620> will<00:00:01.620> start<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.100> drawing<00:00:02.399> by<00:00:02.580> taking<00:00:02.909> a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I will start this drawing by taking a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.249 
I will start this drawing by taking a
second<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.480> look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.689> my<00:00:03.840> reference

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
second to look at my reference

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.740 
second to look at my reference
photograph<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.009> Left<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.490> try<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> see<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
photograph on the Left I try to see the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.750 
photograph on the Left I try to see the
mouth<00:00:06.930> as<00:00:07.140> one<00:00:07.379> big<00:00:07.589> shape<00:00:07.830> first<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.550> try

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
mouth as one big shape first and I try

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.790 
mouth as one big shape first and I try
to<00:00:08.820> match<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.090> shape<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.809> best<00:00:10.019> as<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
to match that shape as best as I can to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.520 
to match that shape as best as I can to
start<00:00:11.040> next<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.150> break<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> mouth<00:00:12.900> into<00:00:13.139> three

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
start next I break the mouth into three

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.770 
start next I break the mouth into three
smaller<00:00:13.860> shapes<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.490> noticed<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> top

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
smaller shapes I noticed that the top

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.870 
smaller shapes I noticed that the top
lip<00:00:16.080> looks<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> flattened<00:00:17.279> McDonald's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
lip looks like a flattened McDonald's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.240 
lip looks like a flattened McDonald's
arch<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.690> bottom<00:00:18.990> lip<00:00:19.170> looks<00:00:19.619> similar<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
arch and the bottom lip looks similar to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
arch and the bottom lip looks similar to
a<00:00:20.279> crescent<00:00:20.850> moon<00:00:21.060> shape<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:22.020> area<00:00:22.350> in

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a crescent moon shape the area in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.920 
a crescent moon shape the area in
between<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:23.160> more<00:00:23.220> complex<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.330> that's<00:00:24.539> okay

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
between is more complex but that's okay

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
between is more complex but that's okay
since<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.529> create<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.039> shape<00:00:26.099> by

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
since I can create that shape by

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820 
since I can create that shape by
noticing<00:00:27.269> nuances<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> upper<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> lower

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.979 
noticing nuances of the upper and lower
lip<00:00:31.489> take<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> second<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.059> notice<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
lower lip is slightly fuller than the

lower lip is slightly fuller than the
top<00:00:36.059> lip<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.110> true<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.680> every<00:00:37.980> person

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
top lip this is true for every person

top lip this is true for every person
once<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:39.420> somewhat<00:00:39.899> satisfied<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.710> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
accuracy and also because color pencils

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.219 
accuracy and also because color pencils
