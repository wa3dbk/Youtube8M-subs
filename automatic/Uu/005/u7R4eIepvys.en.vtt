00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
long ways Oh uni is probably a couple of
drips<00:01:49.220> from<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> seriously<00:01:52.259> rub

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
drips from it and you can seriously rub

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
drips from it and you can seriously rub
that<00:01:53.220> over<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.520> hands<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.939> put<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.149> all

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that over your hands and put that all

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
that over your hands and put that all
over<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.570> hair<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.560> bit<00:01:55.649> goes<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> long

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
over your hair a little bit goes a long

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
over your hair a little bit goes a long
way<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.820> last<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.719> use<00:01:58.110> probably

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
way so this can last you I use probably

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
way so this can last you I use probably
about<00:01:59.250> half<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.750> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
about half of it because that is just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.310 
about half of it because that is just
how<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> roll<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.329> little<00:02:03.780> bit<00:02:03.960> really

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
how I roll but a little bit really

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.380 
how I roll but a little bit really
doesn't<00:02:04.680> go<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> long<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
doesn't go a long way and I know this

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.029 
doesn't go a long way and I know this
because<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.840> still<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
because I would still have a lot of it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
because I would still have a lot of it
on<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.280> hand<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.970> waste<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
on my hand and that's a waste of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.230 
on my hand and that's a waste of
products

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
products

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.930 
products
I'm<00:02:10.330> getting<00:02:10.720> better<00:02:10.900> at<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.460> but<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.670> little

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I'm getting better at that but a little

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.600 
I'm getting better at that but a little
bit<00:02:13.090> goes<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.270> long<00:02:13.450> ways<00:02:13.690> with<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:15.490> I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
bit goes a long ways with this like I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.920 
bit goes a long ways with this like I
said<00:02:15.640> before<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> link

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
really was anything hard I think this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.410 
really was anything hard I think this
