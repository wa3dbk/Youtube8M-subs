00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:04.259
It's "Title In The Middle".
Everybody plays!

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:10.255
Pay attention, in this game we're
gonna see a series of short scenes,

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:14.145
all of which will be inspired
by Daniel Tauszig, our maestro.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.903
He'll improvise a soundtrack, which
the players don't know what it is,

00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:20.676
they'll draw inspiration
from it to do a scene.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:23.740
In the middle of the scene
I'll freeze them,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.548
I'll take a sentence that
you wrote out there,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:29.914
I'll read it, and that will be
the title of the story.

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.734
It's "Title In The Middle",
Daniel Tauszig, please.

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:44.157
Hit the target and win
a bear! Hit the target!

00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:47.727
- Sir...
- That's three tickets!

00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:50.479
There's the gun, go ahead.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.575
You got one!
You have to hit one more!

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:59.921
I wasn't sure if I hit it!

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.592
Go!

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:12.366
Hey, I heard some
shooting around here...

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.267
It was him! It was him!

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:18.996
'It's sad, it's real'

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.173
- It's him!
- We received a report...

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:26.795
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.711
- Mister officer!
- Drop your weapon!

00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:34.576
- Put it on the floor! On the floor!
- It doesn't reach, sir...

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:37.839
He tried to kill me, officer!

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:40.164
But...

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.782
Can you declare that
in the police station?

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.742
Thanks, mister officer,
you are my hero!

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.238
But I paid three tickets, sir!

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:58.554
Sure. You pay, so you
can kill the poor thing.

00:01:58.554 --> 00:02:03.897
But it wasn't just killing,
I would get a prize!

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:10.244
- Is that what society seeks nowadays?
- What is a society, sir?

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:16.763
Society is this thing we're living in!
To kill an animal for a prize!

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:19.228
Which prize? That bear?

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:25.190
What you're saying is real...
But sad!

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:34.021
Daniel Tauszig.

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:07.934
Are you the suitors
to marry my son?

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.352
I'm only 11, sir.

00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:18.278
I'd like to know...
Do you know how to cook?

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:22.363
I can make a wonderful pudding!

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:27.007
I do.

00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:34.323
- My dear? - I use my pan
and I pretend to make food!

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:42.088
'I want, I want, I want'

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.393
Then I put it on my make believe
oven and leave it there...

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:56.925
Then I take it out, it makes a little noise,
and I serve it to me and my bear Ted.

00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:02.622
- And what do you serve him?
- I serve macaroni and sausages!

00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:06.440
I want, I want, I want!

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.182
Maestro.

00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:36.646
Excuse me?
I'm from 402!

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:40.656
It's four in the morning, dear,
what do you want at this time,

00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:44.755
wearing just your
underwear at my door?

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:55.836
I'd like to know if you
have some... Sugar!

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:59.804
Honey, do we still have sugar?
Wait a minute, she'll check out.

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.930
Baby, it's four in the morning,
why do you want sugar?

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.726
The hot neighbour is
asking for sugar, honey!

00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:11.730
I'll never understand this dawn
pudding obsession, dear lord...

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:16.395
Baby, give sugar to her!
Tell her we only got brown sugar!

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:21.460
- Here's the sugar.
- Thanks. But is it brown?

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.095
'I'm gonna jump from here'

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:32.666
- We only have brown!
- Brown sugar gets me down, sugar.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.533
That joke was awful!

00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:51.006
I would do the same!

00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:54.007
