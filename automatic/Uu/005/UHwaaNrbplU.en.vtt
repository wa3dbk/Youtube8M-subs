smart I've only ever tried the mac fluid

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
smart I've only ever tried the mac fluid
life<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> really

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
life I really like this it is a really

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
life I really like this it is a really
thick<00:01:51.540> consistency<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
thick consistency which is really

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.109 
thick consistency which is really
different<00:01:53.070> than<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> mac<00:01:53.549> fluid<00:01:53.909> lines

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
different than the mac fluid lines

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
different than the mac fluid lines
because<00:01:54.990> max<00:01:55.200> load<00:01:55.380> legs<00:01:55.500> are<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.710> Majella

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
because max load legs are more Majella

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
because max load legs are more Majella
it's<00:01:56.460> definitely<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> cream<00:01:57.270> eyeliner

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it's definitely more of a cream eyeliner

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's definitely more of a cream eyeliner
so<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> difference<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.759> didn't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so there is a difference I know I didn't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
so there is a difference I know I didn't
really<00:02:00.149> understand<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.380> but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really understand that but there is but

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.580 
really understand that but there is but
i<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.130> lot<00:02:02.159> i'm<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> fan
