that<00:01:31.680> track<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.979> only<00:01:32.159> 250<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> BMX<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that track it's only 250 or the BMX so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
that track it's only 250 or the BMX so
whatever<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> designates<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
whatever it is a designates as the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.880 
whatever it is a designates as the
extreme<00:01:35.549> worthy<00:01:36.030> track<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> bike<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
extreme worthy track or a bike and so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
extreme worthy track or a bike and so
the<00:01:38.070> donkey<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.460> typically<00:01:38.759> taken<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the donkey is typically taken out of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.530 
the donkey is typically taken out of
that<00:01:39.360> equation<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.840> obvious<00:01:40.140> reasons<00:01:40.530> but

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
that equation for obvious reasons but

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
that equation for obvious reasons but
there's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:42.840> around<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
there's a way around that and it's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
there's a way around that and it's
what's<00:01:44.250> funny<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> i<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.030> looking<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
what's funny is i was looking at in the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
what's funny is i was looking at in the
face<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.259> i<00:01:46.350> tried<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
face when i tried it before but I I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
face when i tried it before but I I
think<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.540> recording<00:01:48.780> everything

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
think because I was recording everything

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
think because I was recording everything
in<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.619> raw<00:01:49.890> formats<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.880> didn't<00:01:51.149> quite

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
in a very raw formats it didn't quite

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060 
in a very raw formats it didn't quite
work<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.720> technical<00:01:51.990> stuff<00:01:52.320> aside<00:01:52.590> squishy

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
work out technical stuff aside squishy

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
work out technical stuff aside squishy

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
when we stream we ride donkeys on any

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.749 
when we stream we ride donkeys on any
track<00:01:58.799> remember<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.490> yeah<00:01:59.640> we

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
track remember that I was like yeah we

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.280 
track remember that I was like yeah we
do<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> reason<00:02:00.750> why<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> couldn't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
do but there was a reason why I couldn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.569 
do but there was a reason why I couldn't
do<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.070> technical<00:02:02.369> thing

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
do it and I was a little technical thing

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
do it and I was a little technical thing
then<00:02:02.790> realize<00:02:03.119> I've<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.450> found<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.930> way

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
then realize I've actually found a way

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.510 
then realize I've actually found a way
to<00:02:04.079> overcome<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.710> technical<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to overcome this technical thing and I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
to overcome this technical thing and I
ever<00:02:05.640> went<00:02:05.790> back<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.240> never<00:02:06.630> triggered<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
ever went back and never triggered that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
ever went back and never triggered that
the<00:02:07.530> initial<00:02:07.770> block<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> reason<00:02:08.789> why<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the initial block and the reason why I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
the initial block and the reason why I
could<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.080> any<00:02:10.890> track<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.790> we'll<00:02:12.120> talk

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
could not do I any track and we'll talk

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.290 
could not do I any track and we'll talk
you<00:02:12.390> before<00:02:12.690> was

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you before was

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.690 
you before was
like<00:02:13.570> now<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:13.960> whatever<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.280> taking

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
like now this this whatever I so taking

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.620 
like now this this whatever I so taking
a<00:02:15.730> look<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.000> track<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.510> running

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
a look at this track that I'm running

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.870 
a look at this track that I'm running
right<00:02:16.840> now<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.800> see<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.700> very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
right now as you can see it's a very

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.340 
right now as you can see it's a very
very<00:02:18.940> difficult<00:02:19.240> track<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.930> would<00:02:20.170> actually

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
very difficult track this would actually

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.390 
very difficult track this would actually
be<00:02:20.640> almost<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> donkey<00:02:23.560> compatible<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
be almost will a donkey compatible and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.740 
be almost will a donkey compatible and
the<00:02:24.610> reason<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.970> almost<00:02:25.210> because<00:02:25.570> there's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the reason is it almost because there's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.290 
the reason is it almost because there's
a<00:02:25.780> lot<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.960> tracks<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.820> just<00:02:28.060> no

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
a lot of tracks where there is just no

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.170 
a lot of tracks where there is just no
possible<00:02:28.600> way<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.260> past<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.560> certain<00:02:29.740> point

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
possible way to get past a certain point

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.570 
possible way to get past a certain point
but<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.540> track<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.260> definitely<00:02:33.100> feel<00:02:33.520> that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
but on this track I definitely feel that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.460 
but on this track I definitely feel that
after<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.510> obstacle<00:02:34.960> here<00:02:35.260> what<00:02:35.380> you're

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
after this obstacle here what you're

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.540 
after this obstacle here what you're
going<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.770> how<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:36.160> eventually<00:02:36.370> get

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
going to see how I will eventually get

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.730 
going to see how I will eventually get
over<00:02:36.610> squishy<00:02:37.440> unfortunately<00:02:38.440> during<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
over squishy unfortunately during the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.140 
over squishy unfortunately during the
entire<00:02:39.040> 30<00:02:39.340> minutes<00:02:39.610> he<00:02:39.670> wasn't<00:02:39.850> able<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.060> get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
entire 30 minutes he wasn't able to get

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.550 
entire 30 minutes he wasn't able to get
a<00:02:40.180> pass<00:02:40.330> get<00:02:40.540> past<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.200> first<00:02:41.380> obstacle

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
a pass get past the the first obstacle

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.560 
a pass get past the the first obstacle
which<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.580> great<00:02:42.760> because<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.180> actually<00:02:43.300> shows

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
which is great because it actually shows

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.240 
which is great because it actually shows
that<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:43.960> some<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.410> H<00:02:44.800> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.160> what

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
that's see this is this doesn't work at

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.440 
that's see this is this doesn't work at
the<00:02:59.590> dinner<00:02:59.740> table<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.520> overall<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.330> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the dinner table but overall this is a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.090 
the dinner table but overall this is a
good<00:03:01.690> thing<00:03:01.720> because<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.440> lot<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.740> times<00:03:02.920> I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
good thing because it a lot of times I

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.560 
good thing because it a lot of times I
don't<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.460> an<00:03:03.580> episode<00:03:03.910> ready<00:03:04.150> for<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.420> guys

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.880 
don't have an episode ready for you guys
and<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> main<00:03:05.050> reason<00:03:05.080> why<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.530> because<00:03:05.650> I

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and the main reason why is because I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.860 
and the main reason why is because I
can't<00:03:06.100> find<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> track<00:03:06.610> that's<00:03:06.640> worthy<00:03:07.210> of<00:03:07.420> this

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
can't find a track that's worthy of this

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.720 
can't find a track that's worthy of this
show<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.350> has<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.650> be<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:09.160> really<00:03:09.460> good

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
show it has to be a really really good

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.210 
show it has to be a really really good
track<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.330> we<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.780> hard<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.350> has<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> at

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
track as we really hard and it has to at

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.210 
track as we really hard and it has to at
least<00:03:12.490> be<00:03:12.790> almost<00:03:13.120> do<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> poll<00:03:14.080> not<00:03:14.380> impossible

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.680 
least be almost do a poll not impossible
where<00:03:15.550> it's<00:03:15.640> like<00:03:15.820> oh<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> can't<00:03:16.420> make<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.630> over

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
where it's like oh I can't make it over

where it's like oh I can't make it over
this<00:03:16.900> gigantic<00:03:17.560> wall<00:03:17.770> because<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.430> not

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
this gigantic wall because it's just not

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.910 
this gigantic wall because it's just not
physically<00:03:19.360> possible<00:03:19.630> for<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.230> bike<00:03:20.410> if<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.770> if

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
physically possible for the bike if I if

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.040

it's<00:03:21.100> something<00:03:21.280> that's<00:03:21.520> close<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.270> possible

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
it's something that's close to possible

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.660 
it's something that's close to possible
but<00:03:23.200> just<00:03:23.350> not<00:03:23.440> possible<00:03:23.680> okay<00:03:24.160> fine<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.400> a
