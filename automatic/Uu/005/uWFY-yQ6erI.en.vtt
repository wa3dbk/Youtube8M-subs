00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.059

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 digital is also has two edition of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 just the edition on light dvd and has 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 also an issue is that the staff 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 It was curious that the edition with all 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.329
 movies netre the complete trilogy box 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.559
 To take a picture is for you to see that the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.680
 box with the complete trilogy in 2d comes 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.210
 in a blu-ray case, right? 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 Are you seeing there in the picture size of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 blob a box with the glove and three cases of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.189
 bluray in a case for each movie 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 already in the trilogy with the movies too 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.549

 ray comes a glove but is a size of 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.860
 baby and are three stories of dvd is then 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.979
 I think it's such a problem. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.189
 releases of an expensive edition, how 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.350
 this technology and packaging dvd 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.200
 I think so absurd 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 but coming back here for this edition 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 individual question only of the third party 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.180
