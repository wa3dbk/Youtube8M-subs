the way if anybody is interested in

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.270 
the way if anybody is interested in
buying<00:06:36.290> this<00:06:36.500> asus<00:06:36.940> g75vw<00:06:38.800> IM<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:40.040> you<00:06:40.130> can

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
buying this asus g75vw IM so you can

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.370 
buying this asus g75vw IM so you can
overclock<00:06:40.640> the<00:06:40.850> card<00:06:41.620> over<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:42.650> core<00:06:42.980> limit

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
overclock the card over the core limit

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.470 
overclock the card over the core limit
you<00:06:45.380> just<00:06:45.620> need<00:06:45.770> a<00:06:45.800> voltage<00:06:46.280> mod<00:06:46.490> I've<00:06:46.760> done<00:06:47.300> it

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
you just need a voltage mod I've done it

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.500 
you just need a voltage mod I've done it
before<00:06:47.920> just<00:06:48.920> stop<00:06:49.280> playing<00:06:49.550> games<00:06:49.790> recently

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
before just stop playing games recently

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.600 
before just stop playing games recently
so<00:06:51.050> I<00:06:52.330> just<00:06:53.330> then<00:06:53.570> do<00:06:53.750> it<00:06:54.010> but<00:06:55.010> if<00:06:55.130> anybody's

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610
