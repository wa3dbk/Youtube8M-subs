00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960 

a<00:00:01.520> man<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.790> training<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.449> run<00:00:03.570> five<00:00:03.990> miles

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
a man is training to run five miles

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.210 
a man is training to run five miles
during<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.120> first<00:00:06.420> week<00:00:06.779> he<00:00:07.049> ran<00:00:07.470> three<00:00:07.980> and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
during the first week he ran three and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.450 
during the first week he ran three and
seven<00:00:08.670> tenths<00:00:08.910> miles<00:00:09.769> during<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.040> second

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
seven tenths miles during the second

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.589 
seven tenths miles during the second
week<00:00:11.580> he<00:00:12.210> could<00:00:12.360> run<00:00:12.650> 13%<00:00:13.650> farther<00:00:14.269> how<00:00:15.269> many

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
week he could run 13% farther how many

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.200 
week he could run 13% farther how many
more<00:00:15.990> miles<00:00:16.289> will<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> run<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
more miles will they have to run to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.550 
more miles will they have to run to
reach<00:00:18.420> his<00:00:18.720> goal<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.539> first<00:00:21.810> week<00:00:22.109> he

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
reach his goal so in this first week he

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.070 
reach his goal so in this first week he
was<00:00:22.710> able<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.130> run<00:00:23.460> three<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> seven<00:00:24.630> tenths

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
was able to run three and seven tenths

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.650 
was able to run three and seven tenths
miles<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.920> let's<00:00:26.340> keep<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.699> mind<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
miles and let's keep in mind what the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
miles and let's keep in mind what the
goal<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.369> five<00:00:29.369> miles<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:31.349> second<00:00:31.830> week<00:00:31.980> he

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
goal is five miles in the second week he

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.690 
goal is five miles in the second week he
could<00:00:32.550> run<00:00:32.899> 13%<00:00:33.899> further<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> week

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
could run 13% further than the week

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.560 
could run 13% further than the week
before<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> let's<00:00:37.170> figure<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
before so let's figure out what that is

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
before so let's figure out what that is
he<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.750> run<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> three<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.530> seven<00:00:40.860> tenths

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
he could run the three and seven tenths

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.990 
he could run the three and seven tenths
miles<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.510> even<00:00:43.100> 13%<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
miles and then even 13% more than that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.440 
miles and then even 13% more than that
so<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> figure<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.879> what<00:00:47.879> 13

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so first we have to figure out what 13

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.130 
so first we have to figure out what 13
percent<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:52.879> three<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> seven<00:00:54.539> tenths<00:00:54.780> miles

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
percent of three and seven tenths miles

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
percent of three and seven tenths miles
is<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.760> means<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.480> multiply<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> we're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
is and of means to multiply so we're

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.299 
is and of means to multiply so we're
going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> take<00:00:59.760> our<00:01:00.000> percent<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.160> change<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
going to take our percent and change it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to take our percent and change it
to<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.489> decimal<00:01:03.680> move<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.220> places<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to a decimal move it two places to the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.359 
to a decimal move it two places to the
left<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.430> then<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> multiply

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
left and then we're going to multiply

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.469 
left and then we're going to multiply
three<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> seven<00:01:12.000> tenths<00:01:12.450> times<00:01:14.479> 13

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
three and seven tenths times 13

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
three and seven tenths times 13
hundredths<00:01:17.720> three<00:01:18.720> times<00:01:19.170> seven<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
hundredths three times seven is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
hundredths three times seven is
twenty-one<00:01:22.040> three<00:01:23.040> times<00:01:23.369> three<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.759> nine<00:01:23.909> ten

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
twenty-one three times three is nine ten

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.270 
twenty-one three times three is nine ten
11<00:01:26.570> zero<00:01:27.570> placeholder<00:01:28.579> 1<00:01:29.579> times<00:01:29.970> 7<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.479> 7<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
11 zero placeholder 1 times 7 is 7 and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.149 
11 zero placeholder 1 times 7 is 7 and
one<00:01:32.280> times<00:01:32.610> three<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.939> three<00:01:33.799> add<00:01:34.799> those

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
one times three is three add those

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.429 
one times three is three add those
together<00:01:36.350> one<00:01:37.670> eight<00:01:39.380> four<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.820> have

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
together one eight four and then we have

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.270 
together one eight four and then we have
one<00:01:43.579> two<00:01:44.579> three<00:01:45.140> numbers<00:01:46.140> behind<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.189> decimal

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
one two three numbers behind the decimal

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.359 
one two three numbers behind the decimal
which<00:01:48.270> means<00:01:48.540> our<00:01:48.689> answer<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.649> three

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
which means our answer will have three

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
which means our answer will have three
numbers<00:01:50.820> behind<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.899> decimal<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.430> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
numbers behind the decimal so when it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.410 
numbers behind the decimal so when it
said<00:01:53.759> he<00:01:53.909> could<00:01:54.090> run<00:01:54.619> 13%<00:01:55.619> farther<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
said he could run 13% farther than that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830 
said he could run 13% farther than that
means<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.140> three<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.680> seven<00:01:58.920> tenths<00:01:59.840> miles

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
means the three and seven tenths miles

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.080 
means the three and seven tenths miles
plus<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> 13<00:02:03.719> percent<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.350> three<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> 7/10<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
plus the 13 percent of three and 7/10 so

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050 
plus the 13 percent of three and 7/10 so
we<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.420> line<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.930> decimal<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:09.000> we

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
we have to line up the decimal and we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.340 
we have to line up the decimal and we
have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.890 

481<00:02:13.350> thousands<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.150> need<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> add<00:02:15.570> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
481 thousands that we need to add to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.290 
481 thousands that we need to add to
three<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.290> seven<00:02:16.470> tenths<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.850> put<00:02:18.030> zero

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
three and seven tenths we can put zero

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.750 
three and seven tenths we can put zero
placeholders<00:02:19.020> here<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.520> 1<00:02:21.140> 8<00:02:22.280> 7<00:02:23.280> plus

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
placeholders here so you get 1 8 7 plus

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.250 
placeholders here so you get 1 8 7 plus
4<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.390> 11<00:02:24.650> carry<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.890> 1<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.210> get<00:02:27.330> 4<00:02:27.630> bring

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
4 is 11 carry the 1 so we get 4 bring

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
4 is 11 carry the 1 so we get 4 bring
down<00:02:28.440> our<00:02:28.590> decimal<00:02:29.010> 4<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.800> 181<00:02:31.910> thousandths

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
down our decimal 4 and 181 thousandths

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.870 
down our decimal 4 and 181 thousandths
is<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.630> far<00:02:33.960> he's<00:02:34.770> able<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> run<00:02:35.250> after<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
is how far he's able to run after the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.440 
is how far he's able to run after the
second<00:02:36.330> week<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.320> how<00:02:37.650> many<00:02:37.709> more<00:02:38.490> miles<00:02:38.850> will

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
second week so how many more miles will

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.790 
second week so how many more miles will
he<00:02:39.570> have<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> run<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.830> reach<00:02:41.040> his<00:02:41.310> 5-mile<00:02:42.180> goal

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
he have to run to reach his 5-mile goal

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.970 
he have to run to reach his 5-mile goal
to<00:02:43.800> find<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.250> we'll<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.060> subtract<00:02:45.980> so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to find that we'll have to subtract so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550 
to find that we'll have to subtract so
take<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> 5<00:02:47.670> miles<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.450> remember<00:02:49.410> with

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
take the 5 miles and remember with

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.120 
take the 5 miles and remember with
decimals<00:02:50.520> either<00:02:51.000> adding<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:51.750> subtracting<00:02:52.130> we

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
decimals either adding or subtracting we

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.020 
decimals either adding or subtracting we
have<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.520> line<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.270> decimals<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:55.220> 5<00:02:56.220> we

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
have to line up the decimals in 5 we

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.810 
have to line up the decimals in 5 we
don't<00:02:57.239> see<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> decimal<00:02:58.220> well<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.520> can't

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
don't see a decimal well if you can't

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.570 
don't see a decimal well if you can't
find<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.390> decimal<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> decimals<00:03:02.100> behind

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
find the decimal and the decimals behind

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.720 
find the decimal and the decimals behind
the<00:03:02.880> number<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.650> can't<00:03:04.950> find<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.459> it's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
the number or if you can't find it it's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.949 
the number or if you can't find it it's
behind<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.220> 5<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> can

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
behind it so this is 5 and and you can

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.410 
behind it so this is 5 and and you can
add<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.320> many<00:03:10.620> zeros<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.580> want<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.880> add<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
add as many zeros as you want to add and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.560 
add as many zeros as you want to add and
the<00:03:13.140> number<00:03:13.440> doesn't<00:03:13.650> change<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:15.330> we're

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
the number doesn't change and then we're

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.220 
the number doesn't change and then we're
going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> subtract<00:03:17.180> 4<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:20.060> 181<00:03:21.200> thousandths

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
going to subtract 4 and 181 thousandths

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.039 
going to subtract 4 and 181 thousandths
from<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:24.299> we're<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.600> need<00:03:24.810> to

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
from that so we're going to need to

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.520 
from that so we're going to need to
borrow<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:27.030> can't<00:03:27.330> take<00:03:27.540> 1<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.780> 0<00:03:28.320> or

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
borrow because we can't take 1 from 0 or

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.860 
borrow because we can't take 1 from 0 or
8<00:03:28.680> from<00:03:28.890> 0<00:03:29.220> or<00:03:29.430> 1<00:03:29.549> from<00:03:29.790> 0<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.660> I'm<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
8 from 0 or 1 from 0 so I'm going to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.729 
8 from 0 or 1 from 0 so I'm going to
borrow<00:03:31.110> from<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.380> 5<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.519> becomes<00:03:32.970> 4<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.590> this

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
borrow from the 5 it becomes 4 so this

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.240 
borrow from the 5 it becomes 4 so this
is<00:03:34.890> 10<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.790> we'll<00:03:36.000> borrow<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.070> is

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
is 10 and then we'll borrow so this is

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.910 
is 10 and then we'll borrow so this is
10<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.850> then<00:03:39.060> we'll<00:03:39.239> borrow<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.920> then

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
10 and then we'll borrow and then

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.140 
10 and then we'll borrow and then
finally<00:03:41.489> we<00:03:41.670> have<00:03:41.880> 10<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.750> our<00:03:43.620> first<00:03:44.580> position

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
finally we have 10 in our first position

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.890 
finally we have 10 in our first position
so<00:03:45.750> 10<00:03:46.080> minus<00:03:46.769> 1<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.070> 9<00:03:48.170> 9<00:03:49.170> minus<00:03:49.830> 8<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.100> 1<00:03:50.900> 9

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
so 10 minus 1 is 9 9 minus 8 is 1 9

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.490 
so 10 minus 1 is 9 9 minus 8 is 1 9
minus<00:03:52.650> 1<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.100> 8<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.940> bring<00:03:54.930> down<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.320> decimal

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
minus 1 is 8 and bring down the decimal

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
minus 1 is 8 and bring down the decimal
and<00:03:56.070> 4<00:03:56.820> minus<00:03:57.180> 4<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.720> 0<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.340> our<00:03:59.549> answer<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.120> an

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and 4 minus 4 is 0 so our answer is an

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.860 
and 4 minus 4 is 0 so our answer is an
eighty<00:04:03.739> eight<00:04:04.739> hundred<00:04:05.070> nineteen<00:04:05.970> thousand

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
eighty eight hundred nineteen thousand

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.020 
eighty eight hundred nineteen thousand
and<00:04:07.739> then<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.100> look<00:04:08.130> at<00:04:08.459> our<00:04:08.579> answer

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
and then if we look at our answer

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.470 
and then if we look at our answer
choices<00:04:09.360> we<00:04:10.140> don't<00:04:10.320> see<00:04:10.500> any<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:11.070> say<00:04:11.480> 819

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
choices we don't see any that say 819

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.530 
choices we don't see any that say 819
thousandths<00:04:13.459> they<00:04:14.459> all<00:04:14.700> stopped<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
thousandths they all stopped at the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.349 
thousandths they all stopped at the
hundredths<00:04:15.989> place<00:04:16.459> which<00:04:17.459> means<00:04:17.729> we<00:04:18.150> need<00:04:18.299> to

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
hundredths place which means we need to

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.770 
hundredths place which means we need to
round<00:04:18.720> our<00:04:19.049> answer<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.700> 9<00:04:20.940> tells<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.570> one

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
round our answer so the 9 tells the one

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.470 
round our answer so the 9 tells the one
to<00:04:22.229> go<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:23.099> a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
to go up to a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.520 
to go up to a
you<00:04:23.570> so<00:04:24.320> this<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.620> approximately<00:04:27.250> 82

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
you so this is approximately 82

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.990 
you so this is approximately 82
hundredths<00:04:30.530> which<00:04:31.010> would<00:04:31.160> be<00:04:31.280> answer<00:04:31.730> choice

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
hundredths which would be answer choice

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.390 
hundredths which would be answer choice
B
