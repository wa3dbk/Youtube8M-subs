00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
anymore really that that's just the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
anymore really that that's just the
whole<00:01:43.740> chapter<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.090> only

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
other thing that I think might be

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
other thing that I think might be
interesting<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> fact<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.149> very

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
interesting is the fact at the very

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
interesting is the fact at the very
beginning<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> chapter<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> very

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to be able to do they're actually

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
going to be able to do they're actually
not<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.540> able<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> defeat<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
not going to be able to defeat the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.630 
not going to be able to defeat the
quincy<00:01:58.560> leader<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> i<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.219> that's<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.579> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
quincy leader and i think that's kind of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
quincy leader and i think that's kind of
messed<00:01:59.790> up<00:02:00.030> obviously<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.840> almost

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
messed up obviously he still almost

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
messed up obviously he still almost
seems<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.439> he's<00:02:01.680> lost<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.159> faith<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.490> them

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
seems like he's lost all faith in them

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
seems like he's lost all faith in them
but<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> same<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:03.869> he<00:02:04.409> says<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.829> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but at the same time he says that this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
but at the same time he says that this
is<00:02:05.100> eventually<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> lead<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.090> peace<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is eventually going to lead to peace I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.419 
is eventually going to lead to peace I
