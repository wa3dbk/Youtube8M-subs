360<00:02:47.990> 281<00:02:48.990> miles<00:02:49.230> an<00:02:49.410> hour<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:51.140> 3.6<00:02:52.140> seconds<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
360 281 miles an hour so 3.6 seconds and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
360 281 miles an hour so 3.6 seconds and
281<00:02:53.100> miles<00:02:53.370> an<00:02:53.520> hour<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:54.180> would<00:02:54.270> mean<00:02:54.360> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
281 miles an hour that would mean you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.630 
281 miles an hour that would mean you
had<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.840> been<00:02:55.370> accelerated<00:02:56.370> rather

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
had to have been accelerated rather

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.170 
had to have been accelerated rather
quickly<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:58.140> course<00:02:58.370> nobody<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.730> under<00:02:59.940> 4

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
quickly of course nobody got under 4

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.840 
quickly of course nobody got under 4
seconds<00:03:00.600> for<00:03:00.810> another<00:03:01.200> almost<00:03:01.920> 10<00:03:02.190> years<00:03:02.490> or

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
seconds for another almost 10 years or

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.540 
seconds for another almost 10 years or
so<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.980> 281<00:03:04.980> miles<00:03:05.280> an<00:03:05.490> hour<00:03:05.600> was<00:03:07.250> very<00:03:08.250> slow

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
so and 281 miles an hour was very slow

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.850 
so and 281 miles an hour was very slow
because<00:03:08.850> they<00:03:09.570> regularly<00:03:10.050> do<00:03:10.170> over<00:03:10.320> 300<00:03:10.710> these

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
because they regularly do over 300 these

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.690 
because they regularly do over 300 these
days<00:03:11.570> so<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.600> was<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> little<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.290> off<00:03:13.700> took

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
days so that was a little bit off took

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.830 
days so that was a little bit off took
on<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> trick<00:03:15.090> where<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.240> hit<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.450> gear<00:03:15.690> with

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
on a trick where you hit the gear with

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.630 
on a trick where you hit the gear with
the<00:03:15.900> gas<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.890> jump<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.250> car<00:03:17.400> forward

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the gas on it can I jump the car forward

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.640 
the gas on it can I jump the car forward
a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:17.880> bit<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.840> before<00:03:19.170> class<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.560> not

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
a little bit but before class is not

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.340 
a little bit but before class is not
that's<00:03:19.890> Top<00:03:20.100> Fuel<00:03:20.370> they<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.300> funny<00:03:21.510> car<00:03:21.780> they

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
that's Top Fuel they have funny car they

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.820 
that's Top Fuel they have funny car they
see<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.740> get<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.860> better<00:03:23.040> view<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> thing

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
see if I can get a better view of thing

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.970 
see if I can get a better view of thing
indicators<00:03:25.830> here

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.399 

so<00:03:32.700> funny<00:03:33.120> car<00:03:33.330> has<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.930> higher<00:03:35.030> rib<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.409> 10,000

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
so funny car has a higher rib of 10,000

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.820 
so funny car has a higher rib of 10,000
RPM

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:55.170 

let<00:03:40.460> them<00:03:40.580> doubles<00:03:40.880> there<00:03:41.090> we<00:03:41.450> go

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.640

663 for Funny Car 185 miles an hour

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.399 
663 for Funny Car 185 miles an hour
again<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.909> times<00:04:01.909> are<00:04:02.209> obviously<00:04:02.930> based<00:04:03.230> on

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
again the times are obviously based on

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.220 
again the times are obviously based on
the<00:04:03.650> 1980s<00:04:04.099> but<00:04:04.659> for<00:04:05.659> some<00:04:05.780> reason<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.049> top

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the 1980s but for some reason the top

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.229 
the 1980s but for some reason the top
people<00:04:06.439> can<00:04:06.650> be<00:04:06.920> helped<00:04:07.099> much<00:04:07.760> faster<00:04:07.969> than

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
people can be helped much faster than

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.869 
people can be helped much faster than
reality<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.430> got<00:04:10.549> modified<00:04:11.409> which<00:04:12.409> has

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
reality then you got modified which has

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.259 
reality then you got modified which has
9,000<00:04:13.879> Baker<00:04:14.120> Pam<00:04:14.629> top<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.280> then<00:04:16.789> stock

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
9,000 Baker Pam top and and then stock

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.370 
9,000 Baker Pam top and and then stock
which<00:04:17.449> I<00:04:17.509> guess<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.660> like<00:04:17.750> pro<00:04:17.959> stock<00:04:18.199> which

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
which I guess is like pro stock which

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.590 
which I guess is like pro stock which
has<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.530> 7000<00:04:19.099> rpm

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.060 

blew<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.630> engine<00:04:28.870> not<00:04:29.530> used<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.800> lower

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
blew the engine not used to the lower

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.250 
blew the engine not used to the lower
revs<00:04:30.520> on<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.820> lower<00:04:31.180> class<00:04:31.420> there<00:04:31.630> but<00:04:32.140> yeah

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
revs on the lower class there but yeah

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.559 
revs on the lower class there but yeah
that's<00:04:32.380> red<00:04:32.650> line<00:04:33.510> kenner<00:04:34.510> electronics

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.690 

it<00:04:38.899> still<00:04:39.169> works

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
it still works

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.820 
it still works
barely<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.660> battery<00:04:41.900> connected<00:04:42.290> one<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.770> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
barely the battery connected one of the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.960 
barely the battery connected one of the
batteries<00:04:43.040> neck<00:04:43.190> was<00:04:43.370> broken<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:45.790> very<00:04:46.790> loud

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
batteries neck was broken but very loud

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.780 
batteries neck was broken but very loud
game<00:04:47.210> whatta<00:04:47.900> ya<00:04:48.560> thought<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.950> was<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.430> played

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
game whatta ya thought that was I played

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.000 
game whatta ya thought that was I played
let<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:50.900> much<00:04:51.110> even<00:04:51.440> though<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.560> never<00:04:51.650> had<00:04:51.980> a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
let so much even though I never had a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.530 
let so much even though I never had a
chance<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.430> play<00:04:52.580> against<00:04:53.060> somebody<00:04:53.240> else

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
chance to play against somebody else

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.150 
chance to play against somebody else
because<00:04:53.870> it's<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.080> connector<00:04:54.890> here<00:04:55.010> on<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
because it's a connector here on the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.550 
because it's a connector here on the
bottom<00:04:55.310> where<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.240> would<00:04:56.330> connect<00:04:56.570> one<00:04:56.750> you

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
bottom where you would connect one you

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.440 
bottom where you would connect one you
know<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.770> i<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.400> just<00:04:58.460> well<00:04:59.240> it's<00:04:59.420> a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
know it i think it's just well it's a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.370 
know it i think it's just well it's a
little<00:04:59.540> bit<00:04:59.720> bigger<00:04:59.870> than<00:05:00.050> i've<00:05:00.170> done<00:05:00.350> a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
little bit bigger than i've done a

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.950 
little bit bigger than i've done a
standard<00:05:00.740> stereo<00:05:00.980> jack<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.490> now<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.360> problem

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
standard stereo jack so now the problem

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.540 
standard stereo jack so now the problem
was<00:05:03.170> it<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.890> didn't<00:05:04.160> use<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.280> standard

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
was it it didn't use a standard

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.040 
was it it didn't use a standard
connector<00:05:05.000> i<00:05:05.030> guess<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.820> know<00:05:08.050> finding

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
connector i guess so you know finding

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.240 
connector i guess so you know finding
somebody<00:05:09.230> who<00:05:09.410> had<00:05:09.530> another<00:05:09.770> one<00:05:09.920> directly

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
somebody who had another one directly

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.500 
somebody who had another one directly
race<00:05:10.490> against<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:11.180> would<00:05:11.300> be<00:05:11.360> an<00:05:11.480> interesting

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
race against it would be an interesting

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.630 
race against it would be an interesting
try<00:05:12.050> but<00:05:12.320> never<00:05:13.040> found<00:05:13.190> somebody<00:05:13.400> who<00:05:13.550> had

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
try but never found somebody who had

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.920 
try but never found somebody who had
another<00:05:13.880> one<00:05:14.800> yeah<00:05:15.800> played<00:05:16.130> that<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.280> lot<00:05:16.930> no

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
another one yeah played that a lot no

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.770 
another one yeah played that a lot no
here's<00:05:18.230> something<00:05:18.470> funny<00:05:18.890> well<00:05:19.820> got<00:05:20.510> time<00:05:20.750> off

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
here's something funny well got time off
