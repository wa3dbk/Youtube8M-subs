00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.900
 finally I'm going to take my sauce with 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.470
 my cheese because they are mine I have here the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.080
 potatoes already cut the oil serves me 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.900
 because I want the potatoes to be impregnated 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.790
 of him remember that only the quotients 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 he wants a particular flavor 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.030
 there's the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.240
 Mix 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 that the potatoes are wrapping this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.299
 oil in chilecito that go away 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 also mixing with the cheese I'm going to 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.009
 put a little salt just because 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.259
 the shrimp, as they are dry, are 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.960
 Saladies then be careful try and one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.220
 try cerrato and it was very tasty but 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.270
 I need a little salt for my parents 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.400
 then we are going to put together the plate 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.620
 I'm going to drink parent wines 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.020
 I'm going to put a little bit of stuffing 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.090
 and hit another spoon because if I do not go 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.150
 to finish here all full of salsita 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.730
 of chile in what nice contrast of 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.280
 colors does not make them good for a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.050
 so colorful saucer there is and what 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 only thing I'm going to do is close it 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.490

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 and in particular this dish 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.260
 very healthy 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.370
 and I decided to do it with panela cheese 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.750
 because it's like an option like how 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.319
 vegetarian always have it as a 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.950

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.680

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.250

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 and what I'm going to do is put julienne 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.720
