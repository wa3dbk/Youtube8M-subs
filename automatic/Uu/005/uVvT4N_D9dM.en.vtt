00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.370 

the<00:00:04.320> rhythm<00:00:04.590> I<00:00:04.710> pretty<00:00:05.160> much<00:00:05.250> stick<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.000> my

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
the rhythm I pretty much stick to is my

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.140 
the rhythm I pretty much stick to is my
the<00:00:07.380> the<00:00:07.410> main<00:00:07.920> part<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.250> what<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.430> do<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.880> based

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
the the main part of what I do is based

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.120 
the the main part of what I do is based
off<00:00:09.390> of<00:00:09.420> kind<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.990> Jinny<00:00:10.200> Martin<00:00:10.559> philosophy

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
off of kind of a Jinny Martin philosophy

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:20.329 
off of kind of a Jinny Martin philosophy
which<00:00:11.970> is<00:00:18.529> necessarily<00:00:19.529> hitting<00:00:19.829> one<00:00:20.039> string

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:20.339 
which is necessarily hitting one string

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.739 
which is necessarily hitting one string
a<00:00:20.429> lot<00:00:20.579> of<00:00:20.699> rhythm<00:00:20.820> players<00:00:21.179> you<00:00:21.390> hear<00:00:21.599> a<00:00:21.630> lot

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:21.749 
a lot of rhythm players you hear a lot

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.680 
a lot of rhythm players you hear a lot
of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.589 

and<00:00:25.690> I<00:00:26.110> kind<00:00:26.380> of<00:00:26.439> base<00:00:26.619> it<00:00:26.830> more<00:00:27.100> off<00:00:27.279> of<00:00:27.599> full

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
and I kind of base it more off of full

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.480 
and I kind of base it more off of full
up<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.020> down<00:00:29.170> stroke<00:00:29.760> or

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.610 

that's<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> main<00:00:36.780> part<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that's kind of the main part of what I

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
that's kind of the main part of what I
do<00:00:37.740> and<00:00:39.710> there's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.130> of<00:00:41.220> freedom

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
do and there's a little bit of freedom

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.930 
do and there's a little bit of freedom
within<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.450> change<00:00:42.990> it<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.940> put

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
within that to change it up and and put

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.550 
within that to change it up and and put
more<00:00:45.120> emphasis<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.690> down<00:00:45.930> strokes<00:00:46.290> or<00:00:46.470> the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
more emphasis on the down strokes or the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.530 
more emphasis on the down strokes or the
up<00:00:46.680> strokes<00:00:47.010> whatever<00:00:47.430> whatever<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
up strokes whatever whatever the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.770 
up strokes whatever whatever the
situation<00:00:48.690> calls<00:00:49.320> for

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.540 

generally<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.320> things<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:54.860> are<00:00:55.010> difficult

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
generally the things that are difficult

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.430 
generally the things that are difficult
that<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.790> tend<00:00:56.180> not<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.420> want<00:00:56.810> to<00:00:56.930> do<00:00:57.050> over<00:00:57.350> and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
that you tend not to want to do over and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.590 
that you tend not to want to do over and
over<00:00:57.650> again<00:00:57.740> do<00:00:58.250> those<00:00:58.520> things<00:00:58.910> work<00:00:59.240> on<00:00:59.450> the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
over again do those things work on the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000 
over again do those things work on the
hard<00:00:59.810> things<00:00:59.870> working<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.560> hand<00:01:00.740> things

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
hard things working on the hand things

hard things working on the hand things
the<00:01:01.310> things<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:02.060> know<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.480> things<00:01:02.690> that

the things that you know the things that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.550 
the things that you know the things that
come<00:01:03.050> easy<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:04.630> most<00:01:05.630> people<00:01:06.020> tend<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.350> do

come easy to you most people tend to do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.740 
come easy to you most people tend to do
that<00:01:06.800> almost<00:01:07.160> they<00:01:07.880> spend<00:01:08.150> almost<00:01:08.270> all<00:01:08.510> other

practice time doing the things that are
already<00:01:11.360> somewhat<00:01:11.750> easy<00:01:11.960> take<00:01:12.740> things<00:01:12.980> that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
already somewhat easy take things that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.240 
already somewhat easy take things that
are<00:01:13.280> difficult<00:01:13.730> and<00:01:13.970> exhausting<00:01:14.750> or<00:01:15.470> learn<00:01:16.100> to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
are difficult and exhausting or learn to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.130 
are difficult and exhausting or learn to
play<00:01:16.400> something<00:01:16.820> upside<00:01:17.240> down<00:01:17.480> strokes<00:01:17.960> where

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
play something upside down strokes where

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.930 
play something upside down strokes where
you'd<00:01:18.260> normally<00:01:18.410> hit<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.800> Down<00:01:19.040> stroke<00:01:19.370> learn

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
you'd normally hit a Down stroke learn

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.880 
you'd normally hit a Down stroke learn
how<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.120> play<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.480> an<00:01:20.600> upstroke<00:01:20.990> or<00:01:21.230> even

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
how to play with an upstroke or even

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.230 
how to play with an upstroke or even
something<00:01:22.130> as<00:01:22.340> simple<00:01:22.550> as<00:01:22.760> just<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
something as simple as just like a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:41.890 
something as simple as just like a
little<00:01:23.450> cross<00:01:23.720> picking

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.510 

maybe<00:01:42.900> not<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.230> best<00:01:43.410> example<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
maybe not the best example but that's a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
maybe not the best example but that's a
good<00:01:44.820> exercise<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.140> build<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
good exercise to get to build up the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.200 
good exercise to get to build up the
muscles<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.010> your<00:01:47.040> hand<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.090> have

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
muscles in your hand you have to have

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
muscles in your hand you have to have
you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.600> definitely<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> work<00:01:49.440> on

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you know you definitely have to work on

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.950 
you know you definitely have to work on
your<00:01:50.280> speed<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> building<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> muscles

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
your speed and building up your muscles

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.500 
your speed and building up your muscles
and<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.430> more<00:01:53.430> easily<00:01:53.730> acquired<00:01:54.180> playing

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
and that's more easily acquired playing

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.440 
and that's more easily acquired playing
the<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.780> difficult<00:01:55.230> things

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.779 

do<00:02:00.509> something<00:02:00.930> play<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> neck<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> real

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
do something play down the neck a real

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.940 
do something play down the neck a real
simple<00:02:03.030> melody<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:04.170> maybe<00:02:04.350> bring<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
simple melody then maybe bring it up the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
simple melody then maybe bring it up the
neck<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> where<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
neck a little bit to where there's a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.660 
neck a little bit to where there's a
little<00:02:06.570> more<00:02:06.689> implied<00:02:07.020> melody<00:02:07.500> yeah<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.429> maybe

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
little more implied melody yeah so maybe

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
little more implied melody yeah so maybe
try<00:02:08.910> let's<00:02:09.360> maybe<00:02:09.569> try<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.379> solos<00:02:10.800> do

leave the melody alone if you listen to
just<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.049> solo
