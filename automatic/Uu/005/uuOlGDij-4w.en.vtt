00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.050 
absolutely cannot wait to revisit this
film<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.530> also<00:04:09.710> by<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.920> way<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.160> target<00:04:10.880> had

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
film and also by the way a target had

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.200 
film and also by the way a target had
this<00:04:11.240> on<00:04:11.450> sale<00:04:11.750> for<00:04:12.050> $27.99<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.430> know<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.120> not

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
this on sale for $27.99 I know it's not

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.870 
this on sale for $27.99 I know it's not
the<00:04:14.360> greatest<00:04:14.600> price<00:04:15.020> but<00:04:15.380> most<00:04:16.340> places<00:04:16.549> had

the greatest price but most places had
it<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.150> $29.99<00:04:18.080> so<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.350> guess<00:04:18.500> it's<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.919> few

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.650 
it for $29.99 so I guess it's just a few
dollars<00:04:19.220> difference<00:04:19.580> I'm<00:04:20.060> went<00:04:20.390> ahead<00:04:20.450> and

dollars difference I'm went ahead and
picked<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.840> up<00:04:20.960> while<00:04:21.400> $27.99<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.700> probably

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
