try that was a commitment that cost him

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
try that was a commitment that cost him
a<00:01:23.310> fraction<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.880> he<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.090> bounce<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.420> he<00:01:24.840> has

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
a fraction but he can bounce back he has

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.649 
a fraction but he can bounce back he has
the<00:01:25.229> faster<00:01:25.650> car<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.700> remember<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> guy<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
wondering why they're not weaving

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
one more full lap they are told that's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
one more full lap they are told that's
what<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:36.329> talking<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> leader<00:01:37.439> is
