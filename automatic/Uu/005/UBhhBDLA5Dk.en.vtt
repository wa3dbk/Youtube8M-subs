00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
on the streets of the Z my day not a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.190 
on the streets of the Z my day not a
breakaway<00:02:41.120> here<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.630> have<00:02:41.720> no<00:02:41.840> goalies

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200

breakaway here and you have no goalies
anyone<00:02:42.800> caught<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.070> goalie<00:02:43.340> yeah<00:02:43.760> he's<00:02:44.030> got

it wait one

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.270 
it wait one
I<00:02:47.140> think<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.290> age<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.680> scored<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.070> said

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
I think this the age of scored it said

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.190 
I think this the age of scored it said
they<00:02:49.460> just<00:02:49.640> went<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.240> eight<00:02:50.330> six<00:02:50.600> okay

they just went up in eight six okay

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.020 
they just went up in eight six okay
