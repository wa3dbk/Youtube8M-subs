managed to just go from there
do<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:15.870> he<00:00:15.960> meant<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.520> don't<00:00:17.520> think

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
do you think he meant it I don't think

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370 
do you think he meant it I don't think
so<00:00:17.850> actually<00:00:18.060> no<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:18.600> he<00:00:18.900> he<00:00:19.230> was

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
so actually no I think he he was

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
so actually no I think he he was
actually<00:00:19.920> aiming<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.550> side<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
actually aiming for the other side and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
actually aiming for the other side and
the<00:00:21.720> spin<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> ball<00:00:22.680> probably

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the spin on the on the ball probably

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.470 
the spin on the on the ball probably
make<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> other<00:00:24.689> way<00:00:24.779> he's<00:00:25.619> known<00:00:25.920> for

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
make it go the other way he's known for

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
make it go the other way he's known for
waiting<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> keeper<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> move<00:00:28.619> before<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
waiting for the keeper to move before it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130 
waiting for the keeper to move before it
takes<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> shot<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.510> preparation<00:00:30.810> did

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and then the last split second just go

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.529 
and then the last split second just go
for<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> yeah<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.700> say<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.450> are

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
like oh well I actually barely much at

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.670 
like oh well I actually barely much at
home<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> beginning<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> season<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
home the beginning of the season I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
home the beginning of the season I
didn't<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.339> any<00:01:05.549> clue<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.540> what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
didn't have any clue really what what

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
didn't have any clue really what what
take<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.420> emergency

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
take it was going to do but an emergency

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
take it was going to do but an emergency
so<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.369> mean<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.729> level<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> hard

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so so I mean at this level is hard

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.760 
so so I mean at this level is hard
because<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.810> know<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> players<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.560> top

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because you know the players top top

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
because you know the players top top
players<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> ball

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
players you know they can put the ball

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
players you know they can put the ball
anywhere<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.710> left

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
anywhere really and they can go left

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
anywhere really and they can go left
right<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> middle<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.570> as

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
right they go down the middle a lot as

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.160 
right they go down the middle a lot as
well<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.830> yeah<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.580> obviously<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
well so yeah it's obviously the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.330 
well so yeah it's obviously the
advantage<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.619> always<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
advantage is always for they for the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
advantage is always for they for the
pennant<00:01:23.580> taker<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.330> fur<00:01:24.509> keeper<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
pennant taker and fur keeper how much of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
pennant taker and fur keeper how much of
it<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> guesswork<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> ever<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it is guesswork or do you ever can you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.819 
it is guesswork or do you ever can you
tell<00:01:27.659> by<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.020> they're<00:01:28.140> leaning<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.680> they

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
tell by the way they're leaning is they

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
tell by the way they're leaning is they
