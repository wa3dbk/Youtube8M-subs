00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello again, I finally decided 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.660
 connect the radio you need climbed 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.610
 here that is, here it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 with in all the cinema goes the wire like mine 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.930
 wiring of course 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.850
 goes here in this box in this box 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.850
 and shut up the healer who showed 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 not so good but not the essence here I am 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.690
 stuffed it here so she's going nowhere 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 not confused not filed wiring not 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:48.890
 clung brought plus or minus hooked up 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.769
 here I connect a column 220 but through 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.989
 the transistor here this time is equal because 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:00.170
 tried to feed the shit from 12 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.130
 it turned out that there is no 12 volts 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.950
 pulls 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.940
 now even damn I do not know all this is mine 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.240
 idea some garbage or leave 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.370
 any step-up transformer with 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:22.930
 12 to 24 but still think not know damn 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.380
 now here's a comment let's do 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.490
 louder music 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.810
 we will connect this most now 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.270
 baskaki and it will start first connected not 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930
 this growth method two power supplies one 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.500
 slightly less 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:48.070
 and the second from a laptop at 12 volts that is 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.700
 pancake 24 would be perfectly smooth who 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.700
 will not start 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.469
 these things so I still did see 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.909
 Here is the wire for sticking 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:07.280
 provodochek it goes over here standing there 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.620
 I switch far away constantly 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.080

 here pulled here they are wires 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.959
 lie while the microphone is not connected need 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.650
 will buy a microphone but connect 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.650

 I studied 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.820
 I understand that in general, everything is clear 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:43.889
 Yes, everything works fine. Now 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.889
 Need to think box about cows 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.720
 as if this would be us 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.729
 lay here did such

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.260
 speaker cut out to see which 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.650
 the volume inside is obtained the volume of course 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.660
 small it turns out about 16 there something 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.090
 1717 liters but 16 but there are almost 17 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.330
 in short, so here it will look 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.070
 it's like a pattern yes by pattern i will 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.370
