00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.620
 2 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 with this week 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.129
 the player of nac who can score 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.240
 that is usually not happy to happen yet it is the hope with these games 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.330
 Most judges is one of Willem 2's new acquisitions this season 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.790
 old player from nac inborst a year ago from blackburn rovers years 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 category 9 that is indeed and 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.269
 That actually came to the offer of boat fall at the competition 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.699
 the street after a defect in him I have a phone call very welcome in one 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.699
 to cool a second from ordinary market 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 then you have to immediately and then I have someone or follow below so to speak 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.240
 you have to do that is not just anyone 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.130
 yes i have heard the good player is getting used to it then too 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.260
 I just took the case from the right case to four years 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.030
 So 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.949
 but playing in the attack and like van mend so i just need france and 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.390
 a scan must follow or earplugs the fam just do my job and and now 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.290
 many players to his employees became judges in 2007 during the World Cup 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.230
 among 21 top scorer of the tournament there, of course, we were already European 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.939
 title with young orange 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.290
 due to the success of the attacker's tournament a transfer to blackburn 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.549
 hedge yes i do have a malika go tervuren in england and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 the attacker changed we have an i enjoyed 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 I think I will come back a bit and 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830
 bruchem 15 the year what did you learn from that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.150
 co-owner more than one actually gets 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.260
 Kramer half in this just that suggests developing and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.900
 also physical and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.490
 technically of course too 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.360
 it I can ride top scorer was divided against European champion 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.060
 has become that highlight that your career so far 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.940
 year to win a very nice race in where your own country and that 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.479
 means 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.910
 top chef that plan 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.770
 I am very happy about the performance of a fan 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.689
 but I also have asthma behind and could stand stadium for also nicer 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.049
 for premier league 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.109
 things like that you already have more clubs in the netherlands so you end up at nac 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.219
 breda 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.430
 and then you no longer want a tick can yes yes I happened there but me 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.569
 I heard where you stepped a little by the sea and then 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.399
 but i left nac and 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.029
 so this pertinently connects to the club in much larger ones 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.229
 we are only twice 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.949
 you want to show that here again in the Netherlands 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.549
 make choirs and goals for a party at the cast 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.290
 we don't have much for the band yet, but it will be a bit more moderate 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.570
 is even warmer but it is not the first 10 to 15 percent fall 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.570
 and then we ask to take a look 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.749
 how do you find your team what are you doing I think it's not good 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:52.939
 it is more joyful 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.839
 the atmosphere is that good 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.989
 furthermore the books spoke
