and<00:00:07.490> don't<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.670> think<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.269> out<00:00:09.540> Wow<00:00:10.290> y<00:00:11.000> ou'll

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
and don't you think that out Wow y ou'll

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.810 
and don't you think that out Wow y ou'll
see<00:00:12.380> if<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.530> switch<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:18.170> red<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.580> which<00:00:20.580> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
see if I switch the red one which is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.630 
see if I switch the red one which is
right<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.260> top<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.720> then<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.260> born<00:00:25.650> in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
right here on top and then the born in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
right here on top and then the born in
the<00:00:26.789> top<00:00:32.870> 10<00:00:40.250> we'll<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.100> even

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the top 10 we'll see you can go even

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.820 
the top 10 we'll see you can go even
faster<00:01:00.620> take<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:03.239> man<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> put<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
faster take this man one and put it on

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:16.090 
faster take this man one and put it on
top<00:01:05.810> go<00:01:06.810> even<00:01:07.770> faster<00:01:08.510> yeah<00:01:09.510> oh<00:01:10.130> hey

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.240 

we<00:01:16.490> got<00:01:17.080> Betty

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:54.060 

go

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.319 

c7<00:01:55.070> crashes<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:56.689> wheel<00:01:56.990> box<00:01:57.290> off<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:59.210> how

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
c7 crashes this wheel box off so how

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:06.870 
c7 crashes this wheel box off so how
does<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.659> go<00:01:59.840> what<00:02:00.079> makes<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.380> go<00:02:04.119> wake<00:02:05.119> this

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
does it go what makes it go wake this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.719 
does it go what makes it go wake this
goes<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.750> front<00:02:09.039> uh-huh<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.340> pause<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
goes in the front uh-huh and pause the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.540 
goes in the front uh-huh and pause the
car<00:02:11.239> yep<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.739> then<00:02:12.950> these<00:02:14.980> make<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.370> that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
car yep and then these make it so that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.140 
car yep and then these make it so that
the<00:02:16.760> motor<00:02:17.030> turns<00:02:17.860> what<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.040> scan<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.849> this

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the motor turns what you scan and this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.610 
the motor turns what you scan and this
is<00:02:20.450> connected<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.950> here<00:02:22.280> which<00:02:22.459> there's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
is connected here and here which there's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.259 
is connected here and here which there's
something<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.980> goes<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:26.090> goes<00:02:26.239> right

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
something that goes and it goes right

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.229 
something that goes and it goes right
here<00:02:26.480> which<00:02:26.959> gives<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.440> motor<00:02:27.860> energy<00:02:28.549> to

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
here which gives the motor energy to

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.030 
here which gives the motor energy to
push<00:02:29.600> all<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.110> stuff<00:02:31.360> yeah<00:02:32.360> where<00:02:33.319> did<00:02:33.440> stuff

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
push all that stuff yeah where did stuff

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.690 
push all that stuff yeah where did stuff
make<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.299> current<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.410> gears<00:02:36.739> thank

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
make it to it in current the gears thank

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.850 
make it to it in current the gears thank
you<00:02:37.940> what<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.049> what<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.620> where<00:02:39.769> does

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
you what is that what is it where does

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.520 
you what is that what is it where does
the<00:02:40.010> energy<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:46.360> yeah<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.140> we'll

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the energy come from yeah you can we'll

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.070 
the energy come from yeah you can we'll
make<00:02:48.680> one<00:02:48.860> maybe<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.540> week<00:02:50.750> we'll<00:02:50.930> make

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
make one maybe this week we'll make

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.250 
make one maybe this week we'll make
another<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.739> can<00:02:51.769> make<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:52.220> too

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.319

for Uncle Bill thank you thank you so
much<00:03:03.709> bill<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.909> is<00:03:04.969> their<00:03:05.659> best<00:03:06.140> thing<00:03:06.890> ever

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
much bill this is their best thing ever

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.190 
much bill this is their best thing ever
watch<00:03:08.810> this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.730 

it's<00:03:15.830> on<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.459> motors<00:03:17.150> train

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.130 

ok

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.160 

and<00:03:24.740> watch<00:03:24.980> he<00:03:25.370> doesn't<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.170> wire

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
and watch he doesn't have the wire

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
and watch he doesn't have the wire
connected<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:27.980> doesn't<00:03:28.280> get<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.520> energy

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
connected so it doesn't get the energy

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.800 
connected so it doesn't get the energy
from<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.420> battery<00:03:29.450> does<00:03:29.990> it<00:03:31.510> until<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> wires

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
from the battery does it until the wires

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.320 
from the battery does it until the wires
are<00:03:33.050> connected<00:03:33.140> then<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.740> gets<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.160> hour<00:03:34.970> I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
are connected then it gets the hour I

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.130 
are connected then it gets the hour I
switch<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:36.890> right<00:03:37.069> here
