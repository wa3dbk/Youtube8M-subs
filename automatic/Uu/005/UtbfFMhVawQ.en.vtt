00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:16.109
 welcome to hollywood studios one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.020
 theme park with studio face of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.220
 tv would be a tv studio with face of 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 theme park 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.830
 anyway in my opinion this is the park 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.650
 most disney with attractions for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 all tastes and sizes and to start 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.250
 to the area of ​​the pizza and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.910
 we stopped at the attraction toy story 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 look and mania this attraction is quite 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.579
 then we went very early and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.039
 almost did not get row orlando does so much 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 heat that sometimes is also a little girl 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.180
 in air conditioning 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.579
 this attraction competes with others 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.219
 target players and I in all 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.219
 Sometimes it is logical to always win the storyteller. 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.549
 and from there we start from a stop more 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.970
