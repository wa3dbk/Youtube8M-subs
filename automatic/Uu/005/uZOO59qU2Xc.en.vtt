00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone today I propose this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.350
 short video to show you the game 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.179
 Samurai vs Zombie Let's go start it 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 with the last update was 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 also inserted in the zombie version 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.570
 as well as with the classic with the samurai 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.570
 anyway we'll go see both of them 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:30.330
 we are a bit volume start you want version 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.160
 classic zombie version 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 let's start from the classic we do the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.239
 fast parity then we go immediately see 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 with the zombie my warning this is a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 game definitely to download both on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 smartphone that on tablet since it is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 free and since and as also 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:56.149
 quite addictive let's join go away 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.149
 ok we are almost ready 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.080
 the game is very simple if we have to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 go ahead call our 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.990
 companions to defeat the various waves 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990
 of zombies 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.690
 I was cooked 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.729
 as you can see we have different combos 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 which we will unlock even going forward 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.170
 different men on our side 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.320
 Let's pause for a moment let's go for a moment 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.110
 to see the other version we go to 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 see also another zombie version 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.330
 here we are that here is between taking at 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.330
 light 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.760
 away gradually 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:37.250
 as you can see the philosophy of 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 game is always identical only it comes 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.180
 proposed on the contrary is instead of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.840
 kill the zombies we will have to go 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.830
 kill 10 samurai in this case 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.830
 we will have our combos 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.520
 thank you here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.530
 we also know right here to do 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.780
 review a moment as samurai vs 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.600
 zombies is still not downloaded and 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.030
 I certainly don't play games that I recommend 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.030
 for the moment everything is bye bye next
