00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.110
 new video by iphoneitalia.com in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 which we show you in eclipse function 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.330
 eclipse as you can see is a tweak 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.669
 which goes to activate the knight mode either 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.220
 this mode in which we have written 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.680
 white on a black background a little in all 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 applications certainly in some 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 applications as settings that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.180
 we are seeing right now 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 works great 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.700
 in others a little less but before going to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 see the usage examples 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.180
 let's go into the eclipse settings and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.830
 let's see what we can do 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 the first thing allows us to activate 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.200
 disable the tweet the second of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 darken the application backgrounds la 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.260
 third to activate orange described 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 as we see here is the last is one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 experimental function to darken everything 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.090
 what is clear in the operating system 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.619
 indistinctly 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 then we have the black list for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.720
 possibly deactivate one or more 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.940
 applications from using the tweak in 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 this moment deactivated app store e 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.880
 so much so that if I go to open it I had it 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 already open before we close it if 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.800
 I open it again you see it is opened in 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.120
 white version 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.659
 so let's go ahead let's see some 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.399
 another example 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.350
 we can see fantastic too 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.359
 a calendar application that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.310
 it works well comes virtually 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.619
 translated we say with the black screen 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 problems without problems instead 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.829
 is there with the calendar app I make you 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.130
 see immediately you see there are 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.799
 some parts remain blank all the more 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.500
 if you use a view like this 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.929
 you see it's definitely not the best the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.520
 result that is obtained in this way 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.439
 but let's go ahead we see the oil of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.000
 seeds you see everything is produced at 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.039
 perfection 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.099
 in this new black screen that 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.220
 clearly at night there is more 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.629
 nice to look at and found this is 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.049
 a function that first applications like 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.560
 tweetbot had already married for 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.269
 sense we see the weather in this case 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.030
 the weather does not change because clearly 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.970
 we have custom backgrounds 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 inside, however, you have seen all of them 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.489
 the applications we see to know from 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.069
 amazon 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.989
 ok also amazon more or less works there 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.239
 these are some elements clearly 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.599
 they are images and remain blank 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.299
 we see the application of the Italian fans if 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.670
 he is also the victim of changes in 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.230
 eclipse among the applications in Italy in 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.530
 this moment is not working well 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.069
 then 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.650
 skip the instagram you see change 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.799
 all exactly as we have seen for 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.829
 the app settings then eclipse is a 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.480
 tweak that acts at 360 degrees on the 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.060
 applications you have installed on the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.639
 your device is available for 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.459
 purchase on cydia store and I will put the 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.470
 price in description and therefore also for 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.209
 Today guys are all a greeting to Andrea 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.209
