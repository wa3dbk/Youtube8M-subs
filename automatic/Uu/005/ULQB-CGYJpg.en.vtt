this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> typical<00:00:01.140> hard-boiled<00:00:02.070> egg<00:00:02.220> yep

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this is a typical hard-boiled egg yep

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is a typical hard-boiled egg yep
and<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.840> drain<00:00:04.290> cleaner<00:00:04.620> also<00:00:04.950> known<00:00:05.100> as

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
and this is drain cleaner also known as

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.830 
and this is drain cleaner also known as
sodium<00:00:06.440> sodium<00:00:07.610> hydroxide<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.599> are<00:00:09.690> going

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
sodium sodium hydroxide and we are going

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.350 
sodium sodium hydroxide and we are going
to<00:00:09.929> uncooked<00:00:10.469> said<00:00:11.040> hard-boiled<00:00:11.670> egg<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.269> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
to uncooked said hard-boiled egg so you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.110 
to uncooked said hard-boiled egg so you
look<00:00:12.509> completely<00:00:13.049> normal<00:00:13.259> egg<00:00:13.790> this<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.940> drain

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
look completely normal egg this is drain

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.570 
look completely normal egg this is drain
cleaner<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.230> let's<00:00:16.590> go<00:00:16.740> started<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
cleaner so let's go started out as a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.740 
cleaner so let's go started out as a
liquid<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.060> will<00:00:18.210> return<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> liquid

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:37.569 

even<00:00:25.140> sit<00:00:25.380> there<00:00:25.620> all

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.660 

copia<00:00:37.999> for<00:00:38.179> memory<00:00:38.539> curves<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.769> can<00:00:40.039> i<00:00:40.159> we<00:00:40.550> can

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
copia for memory curves and can i we can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.600 
copia for memory curves and can i we can
come<00:00:40.820> back<00:00:40.969> after<00:00:41.210> an<00:00:41.449> hour<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.870> in<00:00:41.989> check

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.080 

looks<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> solver

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
looks like a solver

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.990 
looks like a solver
a<00:00:53.180> little<00:00:53.780> bit

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.360 

I<00:00:59.060> forget<00:01:00.020> my<00:01:00.140> basic<00:01:00.500> chemistry<00:01:00.770> sodium

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
I forget my basic chemistry sodium

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.220 
I forget my basic chemistry sodium
hydroxide<00:01:01.910> at<00:01:02.030> reducing<00:01:02.420> agents<00:01:02.900> or<00:01:03.020> knocks

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.259 
hydroxide at reducing agents or knocks
it<00:01:03.380> low<00:01:03.980> it's<00:01:04.220> an<00:01:04.339> extremely<00:01:04.699> strong<00:01:04.850> base

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
it low it's an extremely strong base

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:14.289 
it low it's an extremely strong base
which<00:01:05.720> means<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:08.000> look<00:01:08.479> from

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.930 

that's<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.420> I've<00:01:15.509> heard<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.079> need

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.750 

well<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.600> mean<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:23.960> know<00:01:23.990> how<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:27.340> quick<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:28.520> can

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
well I mean you know how a quick one can

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.390 
well I mean you know how a quick one can
be<00:01:28.880> used<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.270> dissolve<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.780> bodies

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.460 

so<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.180> mean<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:35.660> thanks<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.230> and<00:01:36.320> its

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
so I mean it's all thanks to you and its

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.660 
so I mean it's all thanks to you and its
own<00:01:36.590> special<00:01:36.830> way<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:37.550> in<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.970> different<00:01:38.210> way

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.920 

and<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.689> chemicals<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.409> reacting

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
and not the right chemicals for reacting

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.850 
and not the right chemicals for reacting
I'm<00:01:45.930> sure<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.409> destroying<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
I'm sure if you get destroying the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
I'm sure if you get destroying the
bathroom

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.899 

yeah<00:01:54.110> looks<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> might<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.619> done

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
yeah looks like it might be done

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.990 
yeah looks like it might be done
actually<00:01:56.909> maybe<00:01:57.299> successfully<00:01:58.880> we're<00:01:59.880> gonna

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
actually maybe successfully we're gonna

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.250 
actually maybe successfully we're gonna
have<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> write<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:01.530> know

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
have to write a you know

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.230 
have to write a you know
as<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.010> see<00:02:04.250> right<00:02:04.490> now<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.700> fact<00:02:07.940> I'm

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
as you see right now it is in fact I'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.980 
as you see right now it is in fact I'm
boiling

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.080 

so<00:02:18.530> I'm<00:02:18.620> never<00:02:18.800> going<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> stuck<00:02:19.730> down<00:02:19.910> your

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
so I'm never going to stuck down your

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:29.550 
so I'm never going to stuck down your
drain<00:02:20.590> port<00:02:21.590> drain<00:02:21.830> cleaner

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.270 

the<00:02:30.040> Grade<00:02:30.430> Center

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the Grade Center

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.600 
the Grade Center
no<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.850> mean<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.590> certainly<00:02:33.590> an<00:02:34.370> access

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.150 

football<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.090> hold<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.360> camera<00:02:41.160> we

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
football can you hold the camera we

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.920 
football can you hold the camera we
probably<00:02:42.370> don't<00:02:42.520> need<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.790> keep<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.060> off

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.349 

see<00:02:51.560> there<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.799> little<00:02:52.189> stuff<00:02:52.939> coming<00:02:53.239> off

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
see there that little stuff coming off

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:03.030 
see there that little stuff coming off
that's<00:02:53.659> big<00:02:58.510> quite<00:02:59.510> nice

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

tell<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.129> what<00:03:04.280> I'm<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.580> pause<00:03:04.790> this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
tell you what I'm going to pause this

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.040 
tell you what I'm going to pause this
for<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.720> moments<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.599> come<00:03:08.599> back<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.959> this

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
for the moments and come back to this

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.110 
for the moments and come back to this
later
