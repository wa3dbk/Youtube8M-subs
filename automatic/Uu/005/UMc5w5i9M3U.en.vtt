petunia video inside the spent flowers

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
petunia video inside the spent flowers
will<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.979> bead<00:01:56.539> in<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:58.469> petunias<00:01:59.069> it

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.770 
ball inside that's the seed pod so
that's<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> remove<00:02:08.880> if<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that's what you want to remove if you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's what you want to remove if you
remove<00:02:10.050> these<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> trigger<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
remove these it's going to trigger the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790 
remove these it's going to trigger the
plant<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.819> produce<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.390> blooms<00:02:12.720> branch<00:02:13.530> out

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
plant to produce more blooms branch out

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.990 
plant to produce more blooms branch out
and<00:02:14.040> try<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:15.650> complete<00:02:16.650> its<00:02:16.860> life<00:02:17.069> cycle<00:02:17.280> with

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and try to complete its life cycle with

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.740 
and try to complete its life cycle with
annuals<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.690> life<00:02:18.870> cycle<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:20.480> set<00:02:21.480> flower

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
annuals the life cycle is to set flower

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.710 
annuals the life cycle is to set flower
or<00:02:22.110> make<00:02:22.920> flowers<00:02:23.400> produce<00:02:23.730> seed<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.510> then

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
or make flowers produce seed and then

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.540 
or make flowers produce seed and then
die

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
die

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.310 
die
and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.120> new<00:02:26.270> generation<00:02:26.870> will<00:02:27.050> come<00:02:27.080> up

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and then the new generation will come up

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.740 
and then the new generation will come up
from<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> seeds<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.490> if<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.760> stop<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
from the seeds so if you stop the the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.720 
from the seeds so if you stop the the
seed<00:02:29.960> production<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.010> plant<00:02:31.280> thinks

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
seed production then the plant thinks

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.310 
seed production then the plant thinks
that<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.970> needs<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.240> keep<00:02:32.450> producing<00:02:32.720> more<00:02:33.110> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that it needs to keep producing more and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.770 
that it needs to keep producing more and
in<00:02:34.250> turn<00:02:34.460> you'll<00:02:34.640> get<00:02:34.790> more<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.030> more<00:02:35.180> flowers

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
in turn you'll get more and more flowers

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.340 
in turn you'll get more and more flowers
so<00:02:36.470> great<00:02:36.860> thing<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.370> remember<00:02:37.790> let's<00:02:38.540> let's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
so great thing to remember let's let's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.210 
so great thing to remember let's let's
see<00:02:39.500> if<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.800> find<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:41.620> good<00:02:42.620> flower<00:02:42.860> that's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
see if we can find a good flower that's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.830 
see if we can find a good flower that's
coming<00:02:43.550> up<00:02:43.640> here<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
coming up here now so you can see the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.160 
coming up here now so you can see the
difference<00:02:45.170> between<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.650> two<00:02:47.170> right<00:02:48.170> here<00:02:48.560> is

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
difference between the two right here is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.130 
difference between the two right here is
right<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.670> good<00:02:52.670> bud<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.720> won't<00:02:53.960> want

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
right here is a good bud you won't want

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.700 
right here is a good bud you won't want
to<00:02:54.200> remove<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
to remove that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.030 
to remove that
see<00:02:55.010> how<00:02:55.130> that's<00:02:55.310> nice<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.800> crisp<00:02:57.800> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
see how that's nice and and crisp and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.630 
see how that's nice and and crisp and
clean<00:02:59.110> let's<00:03:00.110> let's<00:03:00.680> take<00:03:00.860> another<00:03:00.980> spent<00:03:01.460> one

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
clean let's let's take another spent one

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.560 
clean let's let's take another spent one
here<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.930> see<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.170> difference<00:03:04.570> spent

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
here so you can see the difference spent

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.420 
here so you can see the difference spent
one<00:03:05.690> will<00:03:05.840> look<00:03:05.960> like<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.560> new<00:03:07.130> one<00:03:07.280> will

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
one will look like that a new one will

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
one will look like that a new one will
look<00:03:07.550> like<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.200> curled<00:03:09.650> up

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
look like this it's all curled up

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.540 
look like this it's all curled up
sometimes<00:03:10.520> there's<00:03:10.730> some<00:03:10.850> petals<00:03:11.060> gone<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
sometimes there's some petals gone and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.390 
sometimes there's some petals gone and
again<00:03:13.550> here's<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.470> seed<00:03:15.470> pod<00:03:15.740> can<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
again here's the seed pod can you see it

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.300 
again here's the seed pod can you see it
in<00:03:16.490> there<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:18.350> what<00:03:18.590> I'm<00:03:18.680> going<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.860> do<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.190> I'm

you<00:03:35.000> get<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.450> bigger<00:03:35.900> plant<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.739> you'll<00:03:37.130> see

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you get a bigger plant is is you'll see

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.330 
you get a bigger plant is is you'll see
all<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.489> these<00:03:38.080> dead<00:03:39.080> stems<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:40.160> just

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
all of these dead stems and it just

all of these dead stems and it just
looks<00:03:40.520> looks<00:03:41.000> horrible<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:42.020> use<00:03:42.709> my<00:03:43.010> my<00:03:43.459> thumb

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
and forefinger to pinch them it's very

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.070 
and forefinger to pinch them it's very
easy<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.300> your<00:03:47.420> plant<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:49.480> well<00:03:50.480> watered<00:03:50.900> if

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
easy if your plant is is well watered if

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.990 
easy if your plant is is well watered if
your<00:03:51.650> plant<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.070> dry<00:03:52.310> it's<00:03:52.640> going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.910> be

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
your plant is dry it's going to be

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360 
your plant is dry it's going to be
harder<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.750> with<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.130> feel

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
harder to do that with so if you feel

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.640 
harder to do that with so if you feel
more<00:03:55.580> comfortable<00:03:55.790> using<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.780> set<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.200> pruners

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
more comfortable using a set of pruners

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.010 
more comfortable using a set of pruners
or<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.950> pair<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:58.880> scissors

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
or a pair of scissors

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.100 
or a pair of scissors
feel<00:04:00.500> free<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.940> does<00:04:02.180> make<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.540> job<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> little

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
feel free it does make the job a little

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.420 
feel free it does make the job a little
bit<00:04:03.430> easier<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:06.500> just<00:04:06.650> want<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.890> go<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.220> and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.979 
you have a whole garden full of pansies
it's<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.170> going<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.410> be<00:04:16.180> easy<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.450> go<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.810> do

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
it's not going to be easy to go and do

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.430 
it's not going to be easy to go and do
all<00:04:18.020> of<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:19.419> it'll<00:04:20.419> take<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.930> long<00:04:21.169> long

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.790 
all of this it'll take you a long long
time<00:04:21.709> so<00:04:22.550> pick<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.540> areas<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:27.070> that

wrong but

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.620 
wrong but
it<00:04:39.110> really<00:04:39.530> will<00:04:39.680> take<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.919> lot<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.190> time<00:04:40.630> I

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
it really will take a lot of time I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.379 
it really will take a lot of time I
don't<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.949> lot<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.190> time<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:44.240> look

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
after mine so what I tend to do is maybe

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.260 
after mine so what I tend to do is maybe
once<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.500> week<00:04:48.530> usually<00:04:49.160> on<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> Monday<00:04:50.000> or<00:04:50.210> a

all<00:04:52.819> of<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> flowers<00:04:55.030> because<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.330> don't<00:04:56.630> have

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
all of the flowers because I don't have

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.659 
all of the flowers because I don't have
time<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.110> go<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.380> just<00:04:57.590> remove<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.130> spent

flowers whenever they come up because as

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.180 
flowers whenever they come up because as
your<00:05:02.030> plant<00:05:02.270> gets<00:05:02.449> more<00:05:02.599> bushy<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.190> produces

back<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.169> plant<00:05:36.409> if<00:05:37.400> your<00:05:37.669> plant<00:05:37.909> is

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
back on the plant if your plant is

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.740 
back on the plant if your plant is
really<00:05:39.370> not<00:05:40.370> looking<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:40.909> great<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.360> would

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
really not looking so great I would

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.980 
really not looking so great I would
start<00:05:42.050> doing<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.770> few<00:05:42.860> weeks<00:05:43.430> before<00:05:43.990> it

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
start doing this a few weeks before it

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.279 
start doing this a few weeks before it
will<00:05:45.259> start<00:05:45.620> putting<00:05:45.860> out<00:05:46.070> new<00:05:46.930> fresh<00:05:47.930> growth

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
will start putting out new fresh growth

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.180 
will start putting out new fresh growth
and<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:50.539> can<00:05:50.750> cut<00:05:50.930> back<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.289> old<00:05:51.409> wiry<00:05:51.770> stems

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
and you can cut back the old wiry stems

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.700 
and you can cut back the old wiry stems
and<00:05:52.490> eventually<00:05:53.479> it<00:05:53.750> will<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.229> will<00:05:54.349> come<00:05:54.560> back

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
and eventually it will it will come back

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.680 
and eventually it will it will come back
to<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:55.039> beautiful<00:05:55.550> plant<00:05:56.000> again<00:05:56.270> but<00:05:56.419> it<00:05:56.509> does

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
to a beautiful plant again but it does

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.010 
to a beautiful plant again but it does
definitely<00:05:57.080> take<00:05:57.289> some<00:05:57.320> time<00:05:58.599> there's<00:05:59.599> a<00:05:59.690> seed

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
definitely take some time there's a seed

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.399 
definitely take some time there's a seed
pod<00:06:00.199> that's<00:06:00.469> that's<00:06:00.800> almost<00:06:01.130> ready<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:02.409> to
