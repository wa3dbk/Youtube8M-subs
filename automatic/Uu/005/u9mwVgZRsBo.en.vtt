at<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.340> top<00:02:04.550> part<00:02:04.730> that's<00:02:05.000> skinnier<00:02:05.420> okay<00:02:05.990> you

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
at the top part that's skinnier okay you

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.500 
at the top part that's skinnier okay you
want<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.130> fold<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.240> half<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:09.100> like<00:02:10.100> this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
want to fold it in half just like this

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.150 
want to fold it in half just like this
to<00:02:11.510> where<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.630> comes<00:02:11.870> down<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.230> half<00:02:12.350> now<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
to where it comes down in half now the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.620 
to where it comes down in half now the
most<00:02:13.310> important<00:02:13.670> thing<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.210> want<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.390> keep

most important thing is you want to keep

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.340 
most important thing is you want to keep
folding<00:02:15.460> this<00:02:16.460> middle<00:02:17.390> part<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.020> itself

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
folding this middle part up to itself

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.040 
folding this middle part up to itself
and<00:02:18.830> eventually<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:20.240> pieces<00:02:20.690> are<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:20.959> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
and eventually the pieces are going to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.530 
and eventually the pieces are going to
fold<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.800> each<00:02:21.950> other<00:02:22.360> when<00:02:23.360> you're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
fold in on each other when you're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.870 
fold in on each other when you're
twisting<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.560> more<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.830> more<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.040> more<00:02:25.100> so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
twisting it more and more and more so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.310 
twisting it more and more and more so
you're<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.180> going<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.540> circle<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.170> make<00:02:27.290> sure

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
you're just going to circle it make sure

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.110 
you're just going to circle it make sure
it's<00:02:27.530> back<00:02:27.680> into<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> circle<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.000> put

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
it's back into a circle and you can put

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's back into a circle and you can put
it<00:02:29.209> into<00:02:29.450> your<00:02:30.200> case<00:02:30.620> figure<00:02:31.610> messing<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:31.970> up

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
it into your case figure messing this up

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.310 
it into your case figure messing this up
okay<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.340> when<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:35.170> you're<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.200> to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
okay now when you do it you're going to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.640 
okay now when you do it you're going to
take<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> tin<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.850> fold<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.300> halfway<00:02:38.990> in<00:02:39.440> on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
take the tin and fold it halfway in on

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.030 
take the tin and fold it halfway in on
itself

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
itself

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.530 
itself
now<00:02:40.130> you're<00:02:40.280> going<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.459> continue<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:42.230> twist

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
now you're going to continue to twist

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.300 
now you're going to continue to twist
twist<00:02:44.540> twist<00:02:44.990> composing<00:02:45.560> twisted<00:02:45.920> foot<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
twist twist composing twisted foot and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.370 
twist twist composing twisted foot and
then<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> pieces<00:02:47.030> are<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.269> fold<00:02:47.480> right

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
then the pieces are going to fold right

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.270 
then the pieces are going to fold right
in<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.680> each<00:02:48.800> other

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
in on each other

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.790 
in on each other
okay<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.050> most<00:02:51.170> important<00:02:51.530> thing<00:02:51.650> is

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
okay that's the most important thing is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.560 
okay that's the most important thing is
you<00:02:51.920> make<00:02:52.250> sure<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.640> lot<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.970> times<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.300> videos

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
you make sure a lot of times the videos

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.180 
you make sure a lot of times the videos
they<00:02:53.690> show<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.140> stopping<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.070> don't

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
they show just stopping and you don't

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.590 
they show just stopping and you don't
actually<00:02:55.310> want<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.360> want<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
actually want to do that you want to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.780 
actually want to do that you want to
continue<00:02:56.840> twisting<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.709> underneath<00:02:58.430> itself

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
continue twisting up underneath itself

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.729 
continue twisting up underneath itself
to<00:02:59.030> mark<00:02:59.209> into<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> ball<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.900> then<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.470> sides

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
to mark into a ball and then the sides

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.960 
to mark into a ball and then the sides
are<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> eventually<00:03:01.280> come<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.760> on<00:03:01.850> their

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
are going to eventually come in on their

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.479 
are going to eventually come in on their
own<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.870> put<00:03:03.140> each<00:03:03.830> one<00:03:03.860> down<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
own and you can put each one down on the

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.610 
own and you can put each one down on the
side<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.239> going<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.420> make<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.840> circle

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
side and it's going to make a circle

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920 
side and it's going to make a circle
just<00:03:06.890> like<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.910> then<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:08.600> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
just like this and then it can go and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.750 
just like this and then it can go and
fit<00:03:09.380> plot<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.769> back<00:03:09.860> into<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.250> carrying<00:03:10.550> case

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
fit plot it back into the carrying case

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.940 
fit plot it back into the carrying case
and<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.570> can<00:03:11.690> move<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.930> your<00:03:12.110> next<00:03:12.170> shoe<00:03:12.500> if

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
and you can move on to your next shoe if

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.320 
and you can move on to your next shoe if
