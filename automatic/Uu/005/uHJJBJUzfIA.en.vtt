cheekbone<00:02:39.470> area<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> chiseled<00:02:41.030> out

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.290 
those cheekbones
really<00:02:42.500> really<00:02:42.800> nicely<00:02:43.040> don't<00:02:43.760> love<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> as

much<00:02:44.330> up<00:02:45.020> around<00:02:45.260> my<00:02:45.470> hairline<00:02:45.740> because<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
much up around my hairline because I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.250 
much up around my hairline because I
think<00:02:46.460> it<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.820> look<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.180> little<00:02:47.210> bit<00:02:47.660> muddy<00:02:48.050> in

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
think it can look a little bit muddy in

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.440 
think it can look a little bit muddy in
that<00:02:48.440> area<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.160> glance<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.880> thought<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.300> was

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
that area at a glance I thought it was

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.800

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
to take away from anything else on the

medium<00:03:27.500> skin<00:03:28.010> tones<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.459> could<00:03:28.670> be<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> really

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
medium skin tones this could be a really

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180 
medium skin tones this could be a really
pretty<00:03:29.510> subtle<00:03:29.900> blush<00:03:30.290> option<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:30.950> think<00:03:30.980> if

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
pretty subtle blush option I think if

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.520 
pretty subtle blush option I think if
you<00:03:31.280> get<00:03:31.400> much<00:03:31.730> darker<00:03:32.209> than<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:33.110> isn't

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
you get much darker than that this isn't

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.100 
you get much darker than that this isn't
probably<00:03:33.950> going<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.640> act<00:03:35.000> as<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.330> blush<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.900> have

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
probably going to act as a blush I have

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.810 
probably going to act as a blush I have
a<00:03:36.140> couple<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.500> really<00:03:36.950> bright<00:03:37.160> ones<00:03:37.459> here

got<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:45.750> much<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.290> kind<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:46.949> my

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
got so much of this kind of thing in my

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.860 
got so much of this kind of thing in my
collection<00:04:47.610> already<00:04:47.910> now<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.330> have<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.780> I

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
collection already now that I have it I

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.629 
collection already now that I have it I
will<00:04:48.930> probably<00:04:49.440> get<00:04:49.710> some<00:04:50.010> use<00:04:50.190> out<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.430> it

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
will probably get some use out of it

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.129 
will probably get some use out of it
from<00:04:50.850> time<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.240> time<00:04:51.270> but<00:04:51.660> if<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.840> were<00:04:51.990> going<00:04:52.080> to

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
from time to time but if I were going to

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.260 
from time to time but if I were going to
seek<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.710> out<00:04:52.949> in<00:04:53.190> stores<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.880> know<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.000> don't

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
seek this out in stores you know I don't

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.000 
seek this out in stores you know I don't
think<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.660> outstanding<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.680> also

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
think it's that outstanding and also

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.159 
think it's that outstanding and also
this<00:04:56.130> shade<00:04:56.400> called<00:04:56.610> pink<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.090> town<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.690> this

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
this shade called pink the town and this

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.650 
this shade called pink the town and this
is<00:04:58.470> actually<00:04:59.039> strikes<00:04:59.520> me<00:04:59.760> as<00:04:59.880> more<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.419> a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
is actually strikes me as more of a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.689 
is actually strikes me as more of a
peach<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.440> normally<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.310> kind<00:05:02.610> of

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
peach and I normally like this kind of

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.640 
peach and I normally like this kind of
shade<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.600> have<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:04.020> little<00:05:04.229> bit<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.590> a

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
shade I just have a little bit of a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.469 
shade I just have a little bit of a
texture<00:05:05.010> issue<00:05:05.340> with<00:05:05.639> this<00:05:05.850> one<00:05:06.060> because<00:05:06.360> I

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
texture issue with this one because I

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.600 
texture issue with this one because I
feel<00:05:06.630> like<00:05:06.690> it's<00:05:06.990> so<00:05:07.380> dusty<00:05:07.680> really<00:05:08.370> pretty

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
feel like it's so dusty really pretty

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.939 
feel like it's so dusty really pretty
powdery<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.600> seemed<00:05:09.960> different<00:05:10.560> from<00:05:10.830> my

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
powdery and it seemed different from my

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.650 
powdery and it seemed different from my
other<00:05:11.190> ones<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.610> don't<00:05:11.789> know<00:05:11.880> if<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.060> got<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.270> bad

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
other ones I don't know if I got a bad

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.510 
other ones I don't know if I got a bad
one<00:05:12.960> but<00:05:13.229> it's<00:05:13.350> kind<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.560> similar<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.979> me<00:05:14.340> and

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
one but it's kind of similar to me and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.460 
one but it's kind of similar to me and
finish<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.180> Amber<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:15.840> thought<00:05:16.050> amber

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
finish to Amber but I thought amber

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.230 
finish to Amber but I thought amber
translated<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:17.400> much<00:05:17.550> better<00:05:17.820> onto<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
translated so much better onto the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.650 
translated so much better onto the
cheeks

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
cheeks

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.240 
cheeks
I<00:05:18.810> just<00:05:19.080> thought<00:05:19.320> there's<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.800> really<00:05:20.100> nice

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
I just thought there's a really nice

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.400 
I just thought there's a really nice
rich<00:05:20.610> texture<00:05:21.060> happening<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:21.690> most<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.260> these

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
rich texture happening in most of these

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.560 
rich texture happening in most of these
but<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.650> didn't<00:05:23.039> feel<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.400> so<00:05:23.729> much<00:05:23.789> in<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.120> my

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
but I didn't feel it so much in that my

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.090 
but I didn't feel it so much in that my
goal<00:05:24.750> with<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.050> video<00:05:25.199> is<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> help<00:05:25.979> you

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
goal with this video is just to help you

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.680 
goal with this video is just to help you
get<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.310> closer<00:05:26.610> look<00:05:26.760> at<00:05:27.060> these<00:05:27.150> blushes

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
get a closer look at these blushes

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.960 
get a closer look at these blushes
because<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.380> hard<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.919> get<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.460> kind<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.849> a

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
because it's hard to get that kind of a

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.779 
because it's hard to get that kind of a
look<00:05:30.150> at<00:05:30.300> them<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.860> Ulta<00:05:32.220> website<00:05:32.639> if

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
look at them on the Ulta website if

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.339 
look at them on the Ulta website if
that's<00:05:32.970> where<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.270> place<00:05:33.510> your<00:05:33.539> NYX<00:05:33.930> orders

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
that's where you place your NYX orders

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.839 
that's where you place your NYX orders
