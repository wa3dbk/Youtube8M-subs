00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.179 
don't know if I like it yet but them
that's<00:01:33.630> basically<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that's basically you can see here it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.450 
that's basically you can see here it
comes<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.549> two<00:01:35.640> parts<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.920> sort<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> plastic

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
comes in two parts the sort of plastic

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.450 
comes in two parts the sort of plastic
bit<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.409> actual<00:01:40.530> case<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.220> in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
bit and then the the actual case bit in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
bit and then the the actual case bit in
itself<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.799> on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
itself and I think the way you put it on

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.240 
itself and I think the way you put it on
is<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> slide<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> phone<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.500> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.040> sort

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
is you slide the phone in into the sort

worthy and you sort of worried about
breaking<00:02:54.810> because<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.380> isn't<00:02:55.770> very<00:02:55.920> strong

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
breaking because this isn't very strong

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
breaking because this isn't very strong
let<00:02:56.670> me<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:56.940> show<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.510> very

let me just show you that it's very
flimsy<00:02:58.410> very<00:02:58.770> plastic<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.730> see<00:02:59.940> this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
flimsy very plastic and you can see this

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320 
flimsy very plastic and you can see this
would<00:03:00.330> break<00:03:00.540> straight<00:03:00.990> away<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> let's<00:03:03.060> try

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
would break straight away so let's try

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.750 
would break straight away so let's try
and<00:03:03.450> put<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.750> again<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.380> sort<00:03:04.650> of

and put it on again and you sort of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.040 
and put it on again and you sort of
slide<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.150> try<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.630> slide<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.870> on

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
slide it on try and slide it on

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.690 
slide it on try and slide it on
everywhere<00:03:07.530> without<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.980> sort<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.430> over

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
everywhere without it sort of going over

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.480 
everywhere without it sort of going over
the<00:03:08.790> top<00:03:09.020> there<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.170> go<00:03:11.840> almost<00:03:12.840> done<00:03:13.490> there

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
the top there you go almost done there

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.660 
the top there you go almost done there
we<00:03:14.580> go<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.610> to

turned on and let's see if it stays that
way<00:04:40.669> or<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.180> move<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.509> case<00:04:41.690> we<00:04:41.870> will<00:04:41.930> turn

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
way or if I move the case we will turn

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.029 
way or if I move the case we will turn
itself<00:04:42.440> off<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.330> after<00:04:44.330> thing<00:04:44.570> for<00:04:44.960> five<00:04:45.740> times

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
itself off so after thing for five times

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.680 
itself off so after thing for five times
rebooting<00:04:46.550> itself<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:47.000> case<00:04:47.210> is<00:04:47.330> finally

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
rebooting itself the case is finally

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.710 
rebooting itself the case is finally
sort<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.990> stopped<00:04:48.919> pressing<00:04:49.669> I<00:04:49.880> think<00:04:50.539> that's

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
sort of stopped pressing I think that's

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.080 
sort of stopped pressing I think that's
what<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:52.000> it's<00:04:53.000> finally<00:04:53.449> working<00:04:53.780> and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
what it is and it's finally working and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.330 
what it is and it's finally working and
using<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.330> phone<00:04:56.600> holding<00:04:57.199> it<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:58.039> can

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
using the phone holding it you can

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.999 
using the phone holding it you can
actually<00:04:58.850> change<00:04:59.330> these<00:04:59.780> cases<00:05:00.320> are<00:05:00.830> there

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
actually change these cases are there

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.770 
actually change these cases are there
the<00:05:01.160> sort<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.520> frame<00:05:01.789> here<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.330> blue<00:05:02.539> one

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
the sort of the frame here the blue one

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.560 
the sort of the frame here the blue one

and holding it why mentor says that the
case<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.139> frame<00:05:06.380> seems<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.800> come<00:05:07.009> off

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
case the frame seems to come off

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.800 
case the frame seems to come off
slightly<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:07.880> don't<00:05:08.090> know<00:05:08.180> if<00:05:08.240> that's<00:05:08.449> it's

plastic bit seems to like sort of raise

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.499 
plastic bit seems to like sort of raise
so<00:05:15.889> if<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:16.310> squeeze<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.729> slightly<00:05:16.940> or<00:05:17.210> sort<00:05:17.449> of

sometimes cover there and see if that
actually<00:05:25.160> visible<00:05:25.729> here<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.360> can<00:05:26.509> see

actually visible here so you can see

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.939 
actually visible here so you can see
that's<00:05:28.009> what<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.250> mean<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:28.669> it<00:05:28.759> it<00:05:29.120> comes<00:05:29.539> off<00:05:29.949> so

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
that's what I mean so it it comes off so

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.520 
that's what I mean so it it comes off so
it's<00:05:31.070> not<00:05:31.220> flush<00:05:31.580> down<00:05:32.110> so<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.199> can<00:05:33.289> see<00:05:33.440> on

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
it's not flush down so you can see on

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.629 
it's not flush down so you can see on
the<00:05:33.620> power<00:05:33.770> button<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.039> power<00:05:34.190> button<00:05:34.370> sort

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639

of level and as soon as I press it down
to<00:05:36.380> power<00:05:36.560> buttons<00:05:36.860> then<00:05:37.039> raised<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.880> wonder

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
to power buttons then raised and wonder

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.490 
to power buttons then raised and wonder
whether<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.720> get<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.960> same<00:05:39.169> on<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.470> other

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
whether you get the same on the other

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.399 
whether you get the same on the other
side<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:40.610> other<00:05:40.760> side's<00:05:41.000> not<00:05:41.240> too<00:05:41.389> bad<00:05:41.659> and

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
side the other side's not too bad and

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.890 
side the other side's not too bad and
that's<00:05:43.039> what<00:05:43.159> I<00:05:43.220> meant<00:05:43.430> but<00:05:43.610> again<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:44.720> can

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
that's what I meant but again you can

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.899 
that's what I meant but again you can
see<00:05:44.930> here<00:05:45.229> the<00:05:45.530> phone<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:46.070> continuously
