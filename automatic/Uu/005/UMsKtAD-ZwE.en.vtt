the Panasonic RC well as a long story
it's<00:00:12.150> actually<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> 60/30<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.679> been

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's actually a 60/30 that's been

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.130 
it's actually a 60/30 that's been
changed<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.230> RC<00:00:16.890> 60<00:00:17.400> 25<00:00:17.840> it's<00:00:18.840> just

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
changed to look like RC 60 25 it's just

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.800 
changed to look like RC 60 25 it's just
a<00:00:19.260> technicality<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> same<00:00:20.730> clock<00:00:21.060> it's

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
a technicality it's the same clock it's

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.769 
a technicality it's the same clock it's
just<00:00:21.990> been<00:00:22.109> repainted<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.740> look<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.779> one

just been repainted to look like the one
from<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> movie<00:00:25.820> anyway<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.240> being

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
from the movie anyway that's just being

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.109 
from the movie anyway that's just being
truthful<00:00:28.070> in<00:00:29.070> any<00:00:29.250> event<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> same

clock<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.900> Groundhog<00:00:31.260> Day<00:00:31.289> we'll<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.830> say

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
clock from Groundhog Day we'll just say

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
clock from Groundhog Day we'll just say
and<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:34.320> anybody's<00:00:34.770> familiar<00:00:34.890> with

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and we know if anybody's familiar with

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.150 
and we know if anybody's familiar with
me<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> Groundhog<00:00:35.760> Day<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.090> song<00:00:36.980> comes<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
me to Groundhog Day what song comes on

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
me to Groundhog Day what song comes on
at<00:00:38.370> 6<00:00:38.610> o'clock<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.660> problem<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.290> these

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
at 6 o'clock the problem with these

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.690 
at 6 o'clock the problem with these
things<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.820> alarm<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> time<00:00:44.190> isn't

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
things is the alarm and the time isn't

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.299 
things is the alarm and the time isn't
exactly<00:00:45.090> sequenced<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
exactly sequenced so for that to the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
exactly sequenced so for that to the
alarm<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:47.789> off<00:00:47.820> exactly<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.600> 6:00<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
alarm to go off exactly at 6:00 is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
alarm to go off exactly at 6:00 is
actually<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.789> real<00:00:51.149> trick<00:00:53.300> it's<00:00:54.300> not

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
actually a really a real trick it's not

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
actually a really a real trick it's not
likely<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> happen<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.190> you've<00:00:56.340> ever<00:00:56.520> used<00:00:56.850> one

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
likely to happen if you've ever used one

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.119 
likely to happen if you've ever used one
of<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.180> clocks<00:00:57.510> before<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> set<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
of these clocks before you can set it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
of these clocks before you can set it
for<00:00:59.340> 6<00:01:00.890> a.m.<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.550> whether<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.359> goes

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
for 6 a.m. but whether it actually goes

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
for 6 a.m. but whether it actually goes
off<00:01:03.860> next<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.100> say<00:01:05.309> em<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.060> another

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
off next to say em or not is another

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:06.830 
off next to say em or not is another
question

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
question

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
question
Oh<00:01:06.990> Lord<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.860> set<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.220> 6<00:01:08.430> p.m.<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.119> an

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
Oh Lord it's set for 6 p.m. that's an

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.679 
Oh Lord it's set for 6 p.m. that's an
issue<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> we'll<00:01:10.710> change<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> 6<00:01:11.400> a.m.<00:01:11.689> and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
issue so we'll change it to 6 a.m. and

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.590 
issue so we'll change it to 6 a.m. and
we'll<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> lucky<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> event

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we'll see if we get lucky in the event

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
we'll see if we get lucky in the event
we're<00:01:19.140> gonna<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.710> song<00:01:19.950> comes<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:22.250> this

we're gonna see what song comes on this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.359 
we're gonna see what song comes on this
clock<00:01:23.670> no<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.720> got<00:01:24.930> set<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> alarm<00:01:26.540> and

been<00:01:33.689> working<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.259> clock<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:34.890> quite<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
been working on this clock for quite a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.450 
been working on this clock for quite a
while<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.450> internals<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> thing<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
while on the internals of this thing to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
while on the internals of this thing to
get<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> something<00:01:39.600> special<00:01:42.710> pretty

get this to do something special pretty
good<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> replica<00:01:44.340> isn't<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.329> painted

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
good for a replica isn't it it's painted

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.280 
good for a replica isn't it it's painted
and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.820> six<00:01:47.820> o'clock<00:01:48.020> we'll<00:01:49.020> help<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and it's got a six o'clock we'll help it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:02:07.230 
and it's got a six o'clock we'll help it
out<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.560> bit

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
