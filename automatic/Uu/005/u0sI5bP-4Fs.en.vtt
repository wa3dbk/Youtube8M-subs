 helicopter 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:24.440
 Let's make a twist called an airplane 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.789
 In this case 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:40.430
 And finally it will be a series of tears that will lead to the helicopter 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.590
 In the beginning 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.090
 Put a string on the thumb and little finger of both hands with the string on the left palm with the middle finger of the right hand 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:59.450
 To treasure 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 In the same way, shoot the string of the right palm from below with the middle finger of the left hand 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.930
 next 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.680

 The string behind the middle finger 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.440
