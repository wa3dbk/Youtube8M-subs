00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and well calibrated on minute reviews 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.819
 as anticipated in the blog but should 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 enter a super giant card game 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.929
 colored set in a beautiful middle ages 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.940
 made of low blows between players and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 very high interaction I talk to you about 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 shadows over empire a game for 24 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.470
 players lasting about 90 120 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.380
 minutes of barbizon nino and vito give you more 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 games a game that will amaze you for the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.820
 very few rules to follow but 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 with the very high implications of it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.290
 deriving 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.820
 let's see reviews but that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
 slam the institutions 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 if I wait too long 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 set and reviews are enough for you 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
 watch a few minutes and not read 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.200
 The aim of the game is to be the player 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 which consumed at the end of the round 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 all their tokens and not cards in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 conflict ie that I do not realize that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 also of another player present 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 above or be the first player a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 finish all your tokens but 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.510
 check the distinct personality 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 placed in the center of the table as you play 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 during our turn we have two 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030
 types of possible actions the first is 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.490
 an action of influence each player 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.970
 is combined with a leader other than 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.439
 others 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 each leader suddenly 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.130
 characteristic we could go to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.110
 only influence characters they have 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.600
 that characteristic trait in what way 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 I look for example katrina and control 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 because it's me I have tokens on it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.570
 I'm going to put some suk flu 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.189
 hayden is made to add a number 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.049
 of tokens I would do traits they have in 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.180
 common in this case two sections in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.369
 common two mice by this time 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.259
 check also cai of the place instead 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 as a second type of move to operate a 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.490
 character if the box control 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 plug it and use the skill that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 written each character has 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.040
 a different skill written in the part 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.960
 low and they will allow to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.549
 add token remove token 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.780
 move the characters to the bridge 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.159
 etc 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 passed the player turn to the left and 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.500
 all continue to take action among the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 two 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 until all of them decide 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.890
 pass a comment ends the round yes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 check if someone has won otherwise 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.149
 all the cards are presented yes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 remove all flu and tokens 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.560
 from the cards in conflict one removes a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 token for each player present in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.840
 this way the first player becomes 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.230
 the player my left 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.060
 and it continues like this when one wins 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.220
 all the first thing I want to say 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.560
 is that the game is really very simple 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 to master as regulation is 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 own question of influencing or 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 use every turn 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.299
 actually for every 6 hides and it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.920
 spectrum of analysis paralysis 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.230
 let me explain what you have seen are 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.209
 only the basic cards but in the auction there is a 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.190
 but the card sector is much more 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.319
 advanced that you can mix with 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.049
 this means a quantity of 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.750
 text on the table in every game really 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.890
 remarkable in small notation is only in 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.260
 English edition so if you have 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.569
 be careful with that language 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.099
 there is a lot about this thing as I told you 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.209
 head on the table and since everything is 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.250
 uncovered is all information 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.829
 complete you risk that some players 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.640
 at the table he wants to start thinking about 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.709
 perfect move 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.750
 my advice is players in two 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.220
 players is much more immediate you see 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.769
 just the blow succeeded in answering 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.360
 you immediately see the interaction of the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.010
 your opponent on a card you have 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.989
 bet and then you can reply 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.340
 immediately did not have to suffer maybe 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.560
 harassment of two others who have been such 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.959
 data and there were two players and played 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.889
 in this way even a little 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.389
 intuitively if we want not 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.639
 necessarily make the perfect move 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.079
 but the move that inspires you the most 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.420
 you saw that effect you wanted 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.639
 do in this turn short do the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.480
 combo a little nose in this game is the 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.549
 my advice 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 you will be under the confident half hour 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.660
 so you can play two or more games 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.829
 three games mixing new carpi and having 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.450
 new setups 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.400
 in this way you will lengthen your longevity 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.290
 and you will have fun 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.299
 at the graphic level then the game on the table 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.880
 from a beautiful visual sensation there 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.010
 are these huge folders with gods 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.780
 very detailed characters very much 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.239
 characterized with lots of colors 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.160
 thwarted in their Arctic style I 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.769
 so rich wefts are less so 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.599
 graphically and these mice that yes 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.859
 add they are removed move the 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.660
 cards that move on the game board 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.489
 they give just that too 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.950
 feeling of this court intrigue a 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.709
 which you are witnessing in conclusion vi 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.709
 I say attention the game can 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.540
 completely split the public or 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.700
 you really like the scripted way 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.889
 of combo like season his games of 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.060
 card sequence combinations such as 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.229
 race for the galaxy 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.980
 then there is a beautiful thing for you 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.810
 interaction 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.670
 the opponent all you will do it 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.340
 you will see a beautiful one 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.650
 consecution otherwise stay at 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.600
 wide as I told you khadr est and in the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.220
 analysis paralysis you would see are the 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.990
 opponents who take your control 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.510
 of the game and probably not there 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.180
 you would have fun like you should me 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.280
 enjoy and have so many cards 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.170
 again to the card industry that 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.420
 I have certainly not even seen it yet 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.050
 all cards in action and in operation 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.850
 with or against me for the rest I tell you 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.130
 if you find it around anyway try it 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.240
 and make a basic setup in two players e 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.430
 take a few turns 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.410
 you will immediately experience the game 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.700
 and you can then figure out whether to get in 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.130
 bottom the game and win the 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.410
 prince or stop with this ho 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.860
 finished I greet you and tell you hello and to 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.860
 next
