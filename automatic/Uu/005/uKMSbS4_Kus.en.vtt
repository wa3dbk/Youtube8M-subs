ah

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.899 

the<00:01:33.350> park<00:01:33.590> or<00:01:33.740> experiences<00:01:34.280> definitely<00:01:34.460> give

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the park or experiences definitely give

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.399 
the park or experiences definitely give
me<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> fresh<00:01:35.360> perspective<00:01:35.570> on<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.229> game<00:01:36.380> it

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
me a fresh perspective on the game it

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.730 
me a fresh perspective on the game it
made<00:01:36.740> me<00:01:36.890> understand<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.630> difficulties<00:01:39.380> that

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
made me understand the difficulties that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.560 
made me understand the difficulties that
the<00:01:40.100> rigging<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.610> animation<00:01:40.970> team<00:01:41.360> would

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
the rigging and animation team would

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.749 
the rigging and animation team would
have<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.930> do<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.409> take<00:01:42.590> such<00:01:42.979> real<00:01:43.490> life

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
have to do to take such real life

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.580 
have to do to take such real life
movements<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.720> integrate<00:01:45.110> them<00:01:45.229> into<00:01:45.290> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
movements and integrate them into the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.219 
movements and integrate them into the
game<00:01:45.770> because<00:01:46.100> they're<00:01:46.310> really<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:47.229> natural

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
game because they're really not natural

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.230 
game because they're really not natural
just<00:01:48.680> say<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.830> least<00:01:51.640> getting<00:01:52.640> really<00:01:52.909> high

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
just say the least getting really high

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.740 
just say the least getting really high
end<00:01:53.479> stuff<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.049> was<00:01:54.619> very<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:56.210> fear<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.450> heights

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
end stuff I was very the fear of heights

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.080

i<00:01:56.899> guess<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.740> ones<00:01:57.979> i<00:01:58.100> actually<00:01:58.340> jumped<00:01:58.670> was<00:01:59.060> a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
i guess the ones i actually jumped was a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.170 
i guess the ones i actually jumped was a
lot<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.630> fun<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:01.360> teasing
