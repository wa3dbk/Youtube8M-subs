Hi, welcome to Equitana 2012 thanks for tuning
in to farmadvisor.com.au, as you can see the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.210
crowds are piling in behind me as the action
is about to get underway here for the first

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
day.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.860
It's a beautiful day here in Melbourne, it's
sunny, we've got competitions ahead, exclusive

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.710
interviews, everything you'd hope to see here
at farmadvisor.com.au.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.350
I'm here to see whatever we can, but basically
i've come along to see how they handle the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.320
horses, do a few of the clinics, and just
see what's it's all about, the different methods

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.470
to the way they do it, we've had a little
bit of a look at the brumby stuff that they've

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.379
caught up there and what you can do with a
brumby in a couple of years has been terrific,

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.430
they had a 7 year old stallion up there and
he's gelded him and now anyone can walk up

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.040
and handle that horse and walk around him,
he was just wild out of the bush.To see that

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:24.790
sort of thing and the methods that they used
to do it.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.210
Equitana actually attracts so many people
from all around the country, we are here as

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.770
a presence from the membership and actually
to gain more members, at each Equitana we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.090
actually increase our membership quite significantly,
we normally pick up about 3 clubs every time

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.090
that we come here.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.149
We are also here so our membership can come
and ask us questions about anything to do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.560
with the association.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.200
You've just finished your first performance
of many here at Equitana, how did it go for

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
you?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.640
It went really good, everyone was into it
and we had a good time, the horse performed

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.259
really well, I was surprised this early in
the morning quite a big crowd of people.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.480
Well it takes an awful lot of planning really
as you can imagine there's months behind this,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.319
to get it all to these 4 days.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.240
We are day 1 now, the team has really come
together absolutely beautifully.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.819
At Equitana, as an event as a whole, what
do you like coming here for?

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.709
I like what they are trying to do, they are
trying to turn it into an education and to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.450
educate people that's my role, I feel like
it sort of suits my horsemanship and helping

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.220
people get along with their horses and I think
Equitana wants to do that.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.270
Hi, i'm here with Wayne Hipsley all the way
from Lexington, Kentucky.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.720
Wayne, Equitana, what brings you here to Australia?

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.590
Well, coming to Equitana is the main thing
is to be an instructor here, i'm also providing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.670
support in the breed village, by providing
information of the various breeds of horses

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.730
to the visitors at Equitana.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:14.079
So the combination of the two kind of keep
me busy for 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.780
a few days.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.879
If you get hurt it's your fault not the horse's
fault, so you got to train them right, I train

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.920
horses for movies, for live shows and in dangerous
positions, you can have helicopters right

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:35.330
on top of them and you know they never really
let down it just depends on the way you train

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.269
them.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.239
It's a massive event and from our point of
view as a whole sale and distributor it's

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.910
a great opportunity for us to come here and
visit key suppliers, Bayer being one of them,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.130
and also customers that we have here, so being
that we buy and transact from supplier to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.300
customer, it's a great opportunity for us
to get out here and see alot of suppliers

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.519
and customers in a short period of time, it's
a massive event and to see our key suppliers,

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.519
i.e.

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.220
Bayer, Bayer is our national supplier of the
year.
