00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
inch and a half inch and three quarters

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.319 
inch and a half inch and three quarters
the<00:00:50.100> middle<00:00:50.309> size<00:00:50.460> seem<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> work<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> best

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the middle size seem to work the best

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479 
the middle size seem to work the best
and<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.110> adhesive<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> ends<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and it's got adhesive on the ends of it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
and it's got adhesive on the ends of it
so<00:00:53.760> it'll<00:00:53.910> stick<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.899> those<00:00:55.050> that's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so it'll stick you can get those that's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.760 
so it'll stick you can get those that's
better

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
better
