00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:17.390
 today we talk about the pizza maker profession e 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.579
 then good things from Sardinia and from 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.650
 japan in the wonderful scenery of 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.660
 Sorrento Christmas a charity evening 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.849
 scheduled in the weeks that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.949
 astronomical brought together some great 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.839
 masters of Neapolitan pizza was 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.300
 an opportunity to ask them if they really do 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:37.489
 this sector offers many opportunities to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 work for young people and above all which one 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.019
 is the best way to learn it 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.820
 looking wrong with a lot 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.170
 attention a distracted person 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.809
 surely he can't be a pizza maker 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.989
 a great passion a spirit of 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.430
 sacrifice a big will 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.230
 intelligence always keep hard in 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.410
 moments of difficulty we are 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.320
 grown up in family activities 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.640
 now there are schools that do 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.460
 a good education and it takes 6 8 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 months to be later 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.720
 then a master pizzaiolo joined 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.450
 a month two months are too few 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.369
 they cite the so-called in various nature that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.960
 imposed case is just what 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.479
 in short it is not enough for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.390
 it is not enough I have many 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.430
 years of experience and wrong as well but a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.070
 little bit of mess-tin doesn't hurt and then second 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.689
 me the school is close to big b 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.770
 masters who can teach us all about 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.329
 this trade 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.270
 then an informal school or school 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.759
 organized and believe informal because 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 go to the pizzerias where they are 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.729
 historically there has also been one 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.140
 then succession of pizzaioli 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.380
 means that there is a school already 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.840
 inside that pizzeria then also 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 those we say so institutional but 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 we become master what transmits to you 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 what are you capable of taking from that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 master for example had two then 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.909
 had my father and my uncle then from them 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.159
 I took everything and cunning stalls for 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.829
 ask and see a lot a couple 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.680
 of years you can still become a 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.840
 excellent pizza maker what does it make of a 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.160
 pizzaiolo the great pizza maker for 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.930
 respect for customers respect 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.820
 of the raw material than the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.940
 tradition sensitivity to 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.120
 stubbornness 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.500
 even strength, curiosity, the desire to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.510
 improving is always there to be discovered 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.130
 something because even pizza anyway 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.300
 had an evolution in a time it was 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.730
 much more difficult to make a pizza maker 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.140
 so we sacrifice ourselves while doing work 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.060
 very much but we have an advantage compared 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 at a time where there were no refrigerators 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 where you can't cut a few 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.210
 time more specific tool than 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
 we can earn we have to give it 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.450
 in search of the best products ea 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.360
 better understand the limitation 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.280
 Italians are more likely to do i 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 pizzaioli or now we no longer have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.960
 this monopoly but I think it is not 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.620
 a question of ethnicity is a question 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.350
 to understand the culinary culture of this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.080
 product and then develop it I could not 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.440
 never make a plate of sushi if not 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.630
 I really know how he is a master of 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.300
 suu kyi a osaka 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.880
 we have a history of 250 years from 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.430
 when the fried pizza is born up to 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.480
 days with and with me or three boys 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.880
 Neapolitan oil comes from it 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.800
 American Japanese now wines 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.270
 mega because who is smart rally in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.950
 this craft is observed 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.300
 mainly local do not exist 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.160
 need to do the Neapolitan word 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.630
 just look at the Japanese facts too 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.580
 not talking about Neapolitan time there was talk 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.800
 in the beginning because he observes they do not have 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.780
 understood how strange cunning of hand that 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.910
 pizza from the future has given the future a 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.260
 gave me a future for all my parents 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.360
 My relatives think you did not have 21 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.030
 children if no one has taken a bad time 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.830
 street thanks also to my pizza 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.450
 cousin and learned to make pizza e 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.280
 is in Canada to make the pizza maker a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.230
 my other cousin fabio de lillo seemed 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.180
 to make the pizzaiolo of the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.769
 pizza ambassadors of all ills 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.140
 if there is the possibility maybe one will 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.970
 puts you in too slowly 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.920
 short to create new talents but 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.440
 enough to change the lives of so many 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.370
 women detained in the women's prison of 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.080
 pozzuoli 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.390
 the month of course held by these 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.610
 exceptional teachers brought the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.260
 pupils to look with more hope at 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.540
 own future even if women 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.860
 currently there are very few pizza makers 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.200
 I believe 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.769
 there must be a good pizza 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 will to know how to make you find yourself 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.260
 in front of an oven throw it in and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.300
 have the fears of burning it and how 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.830
 they say many contexts sa vendola cavani 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.750
 let it be called with the role of being 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 near the oven to handle the pizza 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.190
 to make buns as I have taken 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.290
 confidence so in short when you go out 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.990
 could be an opportunity must 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.490
 be an opportunity to want it is 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.490
 if you want , you can do it
