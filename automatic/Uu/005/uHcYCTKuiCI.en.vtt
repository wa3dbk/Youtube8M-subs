00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.480
 Well the trick to make fill 360 is a 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.090
 little bit different from how some 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.570
 people are used to doing it 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.030
 unfortunately here has been 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 implemented as much the culture of 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.680
 play ska and floor be alone on floor 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.359
 but really when it comes to going to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.939
 try many tricks of those who know 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.220
 make the floor on a flight in a vacuum in 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.990
 a ramp because they are going to be difficult 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.330
 achieving because they are a bit bad 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.620
 used to kicking the trick of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.640
 shape teams then for example 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.340
 with the 360 many people what they do is 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 more or less in this way 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.320
 and hard hits this climate there 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.960
 here what he does is that they are in 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.010
 a vacuum treating it will tend to give 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.790
 many twists and then what's important 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 for this trick is pretty much like 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 it does a flip but it is to click like 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.479
 imprinting the force from behind is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.790
 every time you make announcements in 360 they go to 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.610
 put about two pieces and when 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.520
 I stepped on this foot to tend to turn towards 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.119
 back hard and this foot is not going to 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.300
 turn towards it but it will try to 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.009
 get out front ready then that 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.690
 they are one of the most important things 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.790
 what to take into account when 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.729
 in this nation infiltrate 60 what the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.550
 table wants to go there but the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.110
 try to rotate as if you had a 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 little ball here in the center that allows 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.740
 do the turn properly then 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.210
 you when you realize that you are 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 doing well when they are doing 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.530
 wrong 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.540
 by that same line 63 this means 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.820
 they are not doing much better because 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.689
 because a lot of people who do the 360 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.180
 it tends to fall as much later than 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.579
 what they tried to do this in a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.409
 pass could mean suddenly 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.060
 take more time making the time to 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.439
 soon not to do it then this is going to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.439
 help to be able to make the team 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.849
 ah 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.439
 ah
