tanks<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.260> safe<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> say<00:00:25.650> that

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
tanks but I think it's safe to say that

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
tanks but I think it's safe to say that
the<00:00:26.099> majority<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.580> us<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.970> World<00:00:27.390> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the majority of us have our World of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
the majority of us have our World of
Tanks<00:00:27.720> accounts<00:00:28.410> probably<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> few<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.359> us

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
Tanks accounts probably a few of us

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
Tanks accounts probably a few of us
haven't<00:00:30.779> touched<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> while<00:00:31.590> some<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
haven't touched them in a while some of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
haven't touched them in a while some of
us<00:00:32.340> still<00:00:32.610> play<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.050> you're

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
us still play it and I think if you're

us still play it and I think if you're
like<00:00:34.680> me<00:00:34.980> you've<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.030> opened

mix up a little bit of noobish mists

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
mix up a little bit of noobish mists
with<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.140> never<00:01:19.439> fly<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> and

with it because I never fly it and
that's<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.400> that's<00:01:20.640> why<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.180> to

that's the thing that's why you got to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.780 
that's the thing that's why you got to
prepare<00:01:21.439> fly<00:01:22.439> planes<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> never<00:01:23.430> really

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
prepare fly planes that you never really

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
prepare fly planes that you never really
fly<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:25.049> aware<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.500> hey<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.250> this

fly so you're aware of hey I know this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.120 
fly so you're aware of hey I know this
thing's<00:01:26.790> slow<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.530> slow<00:01:28.740> I

45<00:03:18.320> millimeter<00:03:18.860> guns<00:03:19.269> that's<00:03:20.269> pretty<00:03:20.720> pretty

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
45 millimeter guns that's pretty pretty

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.979 
45 millimeter guns that's pretty pretty

high-explosive<00:03:26.900> round<00:03:27.110> one<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:27.530> you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
high-explosive round one and then you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.350 
high-explosive round one and then you
have<00:03:27.829> your<00:03:28.010> 45<00:03:28.519> millimeter<00:03:28.910> guns<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.299> are

have your 45 millimeter guns that are
more<00:03:29.600> for<00:03:30.430> dealing<00:03:31.430> with<00:03:31.519> other<00:03:31.760> tanks<00:03:33.790> so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
more for dealing with other tanks so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.460 
more for dealing with other tanks so
it's<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> be<00:03:35.180> fun<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:35.690> how<00:03:35.959> turreted

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
it's going to be fun to see how turreted

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.960 
it's going to be fun to see how turreted
tanks<00:03:36.860> play<00:03:37.190> out<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:38.450> war<00:03:38.840> thunder<00:03:39.140> tanks

where most of us are predicting that at
some<00:03:43.760> point<00:03:43.790> I'm<00:03:44.269> not<00:03:44.299> sure<00:03:44.480> at<00:03:44.780> launch<00:03:45.109> we

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
some point I'm not sure at launch we

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.080 
some point I'm not sure at launch we
will<00:03:46.070> be<00:03:46.640> able<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.269> use<00:03:48.220> those<00:03:49.220> other<00:03:49.250> turrets

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
will be able to use those other turrets

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.199 
will be able to use those other turrets
and<00:03:50.810> if<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.109> think<00:03:51.410> about<00:03:51.730> kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.880> weapon

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
and if you think about kind of weapon

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.610 
and if you think about kind of weapon
systems<00:03:53.600> right<00:03:53.810> now<00:03:53.840> when<00:03:54.109> you're<00:03:54.230> flying<00:03:54.440> a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
systems right now when you're flying a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.039 
systems right now when you're flying a
bomber<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.820> kind<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.180> have<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.390> shift<00:03:56.810> around

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
bomber you kind of have to shift around

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.380 
bomber you kind of have to shift around
to<00:03:57.410> another<00:03:57.739> view<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> use<00:03:58.370> your<00:03:58.700> Gunners<00:03:59.060> as

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
to another view to use your Gunners as

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.090 
to another view to use your Gunners as
opposed<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.260> like<00:04:00.410> when<00:04:00.590> you're<00:04:00.709> flying<00:04:00.920> in

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
opposed to like when you're flying in

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.970 
opposed to like when you're flying in
I'm<00:04:01.250> not<00:04:01.280> sure<00:04:01.459> but<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.420> mean<00:04:02.660> in<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.900> way<00:04:03.200> that

World of Tanks I've actually played a
number<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.070> games<00:04:42.310> I'm<00:04:42.700> still<00:04:43.260> rather<00:04:44.260> novice

number of games I'm still rather novice

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.250 
number of games I'm still rather novice
at<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.190> game<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.640> think<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.540> have<00:04:46.690> less<00:04:46.990> than<00:04:47.170> a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
at the game I think I have less than a

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.120 
at the game I think I have less than a
hundred<00:04:47.380> games<00:04:47.770> under<00:04:48.010> my<00:04:48.160> belt<00:04:49.830> but<00:04:50.830> picking

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
hundred games under my belt but picking

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.180 
hundred games under my belt but picking

gonna be fun to basically take into

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.730 
gonna be fun to basically take into
account<00:05:00.040> when<00:05:00.340> you're<00:05:00.490> driving<00:05:00.730> tanks<00:05:01.740> I'm

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
out I'm also excited to see the use of

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.700 
out I'm also excited to see the use of
machine<00:05:09.580> guns<00:05:09.820> coaxial<00:05:10.690> hole<00:05:10.990> mount<00:05:11.230> machine

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
machine guns coaxial hole mount machine

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.680 
machine guns coaxial hole mount machine
guns<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.700> I<00:05:12.730> don't<00:05:13.030> even<00:05:13.150> know<00:05:13.390> if<00:05:13.419> they

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
guns and then I don't even know if they

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.800 
guns and then I don't even know if they
will<00:05:13.930> be<00:05:13.990> able<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.350> incorporate<00:05:14.950> them<00:05:15.190> or<00:05:15.810> they

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
will be able to incorporate them or they

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.600 
will be able to incorporate them or they
wouldn't<00:05:17.080> really<00:05:17.350> need<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.890> but<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.400> know

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
right you look at the back of the turret

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.190 
right you look at the back of the turret
on<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.160> t28<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.880> machine<00:05:22.180> on<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.419> back<00:05:22.630> you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
on this t28 that machine on the back you

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.260 
on this t28 that machine on the back you
don't<00:05:23.380> really<00:05:23.560> need<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:23.919> at<00:05:24.610> some<00:05:24.940> point<00:05:24.970> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
don't really need it at some point it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.909 
don't really need it at some point it
would<00:05:25.450> be<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.600> cool<00:05:25.840> feature<00:05:26.140> just<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.710> have
