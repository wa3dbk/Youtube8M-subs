comes to the mid game and especially the
late<00:00:06.359> game<00:00:06.600> knowing<00:00:07.230> when<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.500> group<00:00:07.799> is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
late game knowing when to group is

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.410 
late game knowing when to group is
something<00:00:08.280> players<00:00:08.490> struggle<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.120> quite<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
something players struggle with quite a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.300 
something players struggle with quite a
bit<00:00:09.690> let's<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.469> started<00:00:15.560> now<00:00:16.560> after<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.160> make

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
bit let's get started now after you make

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.710 
bit let's get started now after you make
the<00:00:17.340> transition<00:00:17.640> into<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> mid<00:00:18.480> game

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the transition into the mid game

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.689 
the transition into the mid game
grouping<00:00:19.260> becomes<00:00:19.619> an<00:00:19.859> extremely<00:00:20.520> relevant

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
grouping becomes an extremely relevant

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090 
grouping becomes an extremely relevant
thing<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.840> whichever<00:00:22.500> team<00:00:22.800> does<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
thing to do and whichever team does it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
thing to do and whichever team does it
better<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.850> often<00:00:24.119> decide<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.140> game<00:00:25.170> if<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
better can often decide the game if the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
better can often decide the game if the
laning<00:00:26.160> phase<00:00:26.310> was<00:00:26.490> pretty<00:00:26.730> close<00:00:27.029> let's<00:00:28.019> go

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
laning phase was pretty close let's go

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.750 
laning phase was pretty close let's go
over<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.470> situations<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.369> team<00:00:29.580> should

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
over what situations your team should

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.659 
over what situations your team should
group<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> why<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.189> first<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
group in and why the first thing to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.220 
group in and why the first thing to
understand<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.600> grouping<00:00:34.050> your

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
understand is that when grouping your

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.930 
understand is that when grouping your
team<00:00:34.500> needs<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.010> looking<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.579> accomplish

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
team needs to be looking to accomplish

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.810 
team needs to be looking to accomplish
something<00:00:36.649> looking<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.800> teamfights<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.460> five

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
something looking for teamfights as five

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.080 
something looking for teamfights as five
players<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.510> probably<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> most<00:00:40.200> common<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
players is probably the most common and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
players is probably the most common and
the<00:00:42.090> best<00:00:42.300> reason<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> group<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.590> think

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the best reason to group if you think

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979 
the best reason to group if you think
you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.219> win<00:00:44.399> team<00:00:44.700> fights<00:00:44.969> grouping<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you can win team fights grouping and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
you can win team fights grouping and
pressuring<00:00:46.530> objectives<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> great<00:00:47.760> way<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pressuring objectives is a great way to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.630 
pressuring objectives is a great way to
set<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.480> those<00:00:48.690> fights<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.289> well<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.250> team

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
set up those fights as well as any team

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
set up those fights as well as any team
based<00:00:50.910> plays<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.420> team<00:00:51.449> might<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> looking

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

jump<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> target<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.729> walk<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.210> just

make sure to clear out the opponent's
wards<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> best<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.290> all<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.590> these

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
wards the best you can all of these

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
wards the best you can all of these
things<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.159> reasons<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> group<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> need

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
things are reasons to group so you need

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
things are reasons to group so you need
to<00:01:30.780> actively<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.860> team<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to actively think what your team is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
to actively think what your team is
trying<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> group<00:01:33.180> accordingly<00:01:33.740> when

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
trying to do and group accordingly when

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
trying to do and group accordingly when
you're<00:01:34.860> behind<00:01:35.009> grouping<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.990> fantastic

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you're behind grouping is fantastic

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.870 
you're behind grouping is fantastic
since<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> pic<00:01:37.650> potential<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.549> gives<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
since the pic potential really gives you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660 
since the pic potential really gives you
a<00:01:38.939> larger<00:01:39.689> chance<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.200> coming<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:41.040> rather

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
a larger chance at coming back rather

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
a larger chance at coming back rather
than<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.119> pushing<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.810> lanes<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
than just pushing out your lanes and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
than just pushing out your lanes and
hoping<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> farm<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.119> grouping<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hoping to farm up grouping is a really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
hoping to farm up grouping is a really
proactive<00:01:46.020> play<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> team<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.549> group's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
proactive play and the team that group's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
proactive play and the team that group's
first<00:01:48.149> often<00:01:48.689> gets<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.290> big<00:01:49.470> advantage

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
first often gets a pretty big advantage

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
first often gets a pretty big advantage
and<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.670> even<00:01:50.790> force<00:01:51.210> 4v5<00:01:51.840> fights<00:01:52.200> sometimes

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and can even force 4v5 fights sometimes

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.069 
and can even force 4v5 fights sometimes
so<00:01:53.369> grouping<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.240> often<00:01:54.540> than<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so grouping is more often than not a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.749 
so grouping is more often than not a
better<00:01:55.350> play<00:01:55.710> than<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:56.250> something<00:01:56.430> other

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
better play than doing something other

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
better play than doing something other
than<00:01:57.030> grouping<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.229> sure<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> when

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
than grouping just make sure that when

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.920 
than grouping just make sure that when
you<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.159> group<00:01:59.670> you're<00:02:00.090> doing<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you actually group you're doing it for a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.580 
you actually group you're doing it for a
reason<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.750> addition<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
reason and in addition you're going to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
reason and in addition you're going to
need<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> group<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> defensive<00:02:05.909> tactic<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
need to group as a defensive tactic to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.690 
need to group as a defensive tactic to
if<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.320> opponents<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.770> pressuring<00:02:08.220> heavily

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
if your opponents are pressuring heavily

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.279 
if your opponents are pressuring heavily
you'll<00:02:08.910> need<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> group<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.810> able<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.080> deal

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you'll need to group to be able to deal

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
you'll need to group to be able to deal
with<00:02:10.560> their<00:02:10.739> pressure<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.760> lose<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.209> a

bunch of free up jack
gives<00:02:13.690> because<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.800> you're<00:02:15.040> often

gives because of this you're often

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.130 
gives because of this you're often
forced<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.730> group<00:02:16.000> whenever<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.690> opponent's

to do that you need to do things such as
