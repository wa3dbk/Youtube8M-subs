the<00:01:11.820> boys<00:01:12.149> ran<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.320> quite

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the boys ran out which was quite

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.570 
the boys ran out which was quite
annoying<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
annoying so out to go back and do it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.460 
annoying so out to go back and do it
again

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.270 

and<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:19.070> think<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.730> time<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.210> works

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
and I think this is the time it works

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.890 
and I think this is the time it works
i<00:01:22.310> thinkI<00:01:23.150> who<00:01:23.300> is<00:01:23.420> doing<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.690> same<00:01:23.840> thing

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
i thinkI who is doing the same thing

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.810 
i thinkI who is doing the same thing
since<00:01:24.410> he<00:01:24.620> was<00:01:24.740> running<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.100> same<00:01:25.250> as<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.670> was

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
since he was running the same as I was

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.530 
since he was running the same as I was
anyway

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.370 

there<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.140> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.969 

felis<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.310> who<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.880> innocent

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
felis is the one who I'm innocent

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.450 
felis is the one who I'm innocent
there<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.969> as<00:01:38.299> 11.6<00:01:39.229> two<00:01:39.409> mil<00:01:39.680> move<00:01:40.009> element

which is pretty ridiculous

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.760 
which is pretty ridiculous
11:26<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.180> venom<00:01:44.570> would<00:01:44.690> put<00:01:44.900> my<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.470> real

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
damage Ranger something like seven mil

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.010 
damage Ranger something like seven mil
which<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.590> stupidly<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> DB<00:01:50.420> considering

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
which is stupidly I for a DB considering

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.150

higher as well but yeah the only way of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.840 
higher as well but yeah the only way of
really<00:02:12.500> finding<00:02:12.830> out<00:02:13.010> how<00:02:13.280> high<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.640> she<00:02:13.820> is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
