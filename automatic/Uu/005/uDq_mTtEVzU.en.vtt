this<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:12.939> obviously<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.270> particular<00:01:13.600> hot<00:01:13.840> area

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
this is obviously a particular hot area

this is obviously a particular hot area
with<00:01:14.470> too<00:01:14.650> much<00:01:14.770> virus<00:01:15.189> we<00:01:15.400> put<00:01:15.549> them<00:01:15.640> down

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
with too much virus we put them down

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.219 
with too much virus we put them down
there<00:01:15.970> they'd<00:01:16.150> be<00:01:16.240> too<00:01:16.360> wiped<00:01:16.509> out<00:01:16.750> instantly

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
there they'd be too wiped out instantly

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
so if it's quite early ER here squads

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.990

more cerebral side to it there's quite
