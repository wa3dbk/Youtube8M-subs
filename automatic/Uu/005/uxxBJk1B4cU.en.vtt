00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.570
 Vidovic 9, however, ran out of the starting line today as one of four play now 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.839
 against Brazil did not make it into the starting lineup 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.240
 this new FCZ managed against Xamax what denies him against the Munich 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.970
 he stayed forced the opponent to start his game on 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.050
 Mandatory but Walldorf's not yet by Oliver Buff 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.739
 the FCZ remained on the trigger 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.739
 Eckert is in a double pass with Nikci 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 some Miezi afterwards fell 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.080
 almost 20 minutes 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.210
 xamax-goalie Bédénik not in this scene much is here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.420
 both here and Jan Lipke but customers continue to play later 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.840
 xamax coach Caparros had set his team's defensive chances 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200
 new boats were therefore in short supply 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 But for once then Marx is in attack 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 Paris take the magic show the Leoni to a glittering parade 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.950
 Kähler you take the header duel against the Spanish striker lost 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 Xamax though 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 which continues to be without hits this season 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.600
 Nuzzolo at break in Zurich Letzigrund Time to relax for the 7900 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.230
 spectator 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.550
 but not for the Xamax 11 she added a few extra 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.120
 Stretching exercises 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.210
 the flexible team remained the FCZ albeit modest 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 level 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 try it from a distance after 59 minutes 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.540
 that was the best thing to offer the FCZ in the second half until then 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.420
 would have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.900
 So that the Ritchie start nobody satisfied 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 no question the heat was troubling the players 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.390
 not just 9 million he did not want to set any impulses 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.950
 but an additional drinking break but hoped but violently 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.180
 limit Wiesbaden 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.990
 the FCZ but the flank comes the time of only twelve minutes begins 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.090
 play 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.490
 which vote with the direct acceptance 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.490
 the young Zurich keeper came into play shortly before 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 then the direct counterattack of the Neuchâtel 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.579
 and here was the historic moment the first goal of Neuchâtel Xamax in the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.420
 current season Marx Veloso Kaminski Xamax 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.679
 28 minutes had the Neuchatel have to wait until they finally into 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.509
 hit the opposing goal 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:39.589
 one to zero 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:40.939
 Fitz on 1 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.090
 it was already 87 ten minutes the FCZ tried the one answer 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 Bédénik most likely XVI 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:57.489
 The ball was not brought under Navarro Letizia from close range 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.100
 it was already the stoppage time 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.800
 and it got even fatter for the FCZ Leoni with the most motivated and outside 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.899
 this evening 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.239
 and Sébastien Wüthrich knew no mercy 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.660
 the 2 0 for Xamax in the 3 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.009
 ninetieth minute 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.009
 and at the same time the team result 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.489
 Ironically, at the FCZ the thought leaders from big names 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.679
 Europe is dreaming 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.679
 Xamax eating his first hit 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.949
 to better defend the networks 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.729
 "It was when I was so Eugen and we were introduced to and have from their 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.339
 Also not so the finds should be back but our game balked 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.819
 at least not worth it 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.969
 In the end, if she did not succeed, she would lose and thus be solid 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.149
 the games 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:56.279
 Nom -zins 2 at home against Xamax total disillusionment FCZ
