method that works for me it's a good

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.540 
method that works for me it's a good
place<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.900> start<00:00:51.350> when<00:00:52.100> you're<00:00:52.190> learning<00:00:52.370> to

approach the instrument properly the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.450 
approach the instrument properly the
first<00:00:59.329> step<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.079> spread<00:01:00.350> your<00:01:00.500> feet<00:01:00.800> so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
playing a cymbal crash there are three

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.310 
playing a cymbal crash there are three
stages<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.679> every<00:01:16.070> cymbal<00:01:16.429> crash<00:01:17.050> one<00:01:18.050> is<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
stages to every cymbal crash one is the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.400 
stages to every cymbal crash one is the
preparation<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:20.390> second<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.020> actual

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
preparation the second is the actual

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.930 
preparation the second is the actual
stroke<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:23.360> third<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.840> release<00:01:24.200> in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
stroke and the third is the release in

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.219 
stroke and the third is the release in
preparing<00:01:25.940> try<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.720> keep<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> cymbals

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
preparing try and keep the cymbals

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.190 
preparing try and keep the cymbals
together<00:01:27.549> before<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.670> play<00:01:29.020> separate<00:01:30.020> them

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
together before you play separate them

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.780 
together before you play separate them
just<00:01:30.560> before<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.729> cymbal<00:01:32.090> crash<00:01:32.329> is<00:01:32.600> required

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
just before the cymbal crash is required

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.980 
just before the cymbal crash is required
follow-through<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.270> important<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.810> have<00:01:35.869> a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
follow-through it's important to have a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.109 
follow-through it's important to have a
nice<00:01:36.200> motion<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.920> allows<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.579> cymbals<00:01:37.970> to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
nice motion that allows the cymbals to

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.649 
nice motion that allows the cymbals to
vibrate<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:40.579> want<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.970> hear<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.299> cymbal

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
vibrate you want to hear the cymbal

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.450 
vibrate you want to hear the cymbal
crash<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.470> also<00:01:42.710> want<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.159> hear<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
crash but you also want to hear the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.999 
crash but you also want to hear the
resultant<00:01:43.939> vibrations<00:01:44.600> after<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.560> actual

the<00:01:57.320> cymbals<00:01:57.530> let<00:01:58.399> me<00:01:58.520> talk<00:01:58.729> about<00:01:59.030> what<00:01:59.420> not

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the cymbals let me talk about what not

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.530 
the cymbals let me talk about what not
to<00:02:00.049> do<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.579> see<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.610> lot<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.850> young<00:02:02.180> inexperienced

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
to do I see a lot of young inexperienced

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.859 
to do I see a lot of young inexperienced
players<00:02:03.290> bring<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.340> cymbals<00:02:04.670> together<00:02:04.869> so

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
players bring the cymbals together so

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.009 
players bring the cymbals together so
the<00:02:05.990> edges<00:02:06.320> all<00:02:06.469> meet<00:02:06.680> at<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.829> same<00:02:07.100> time<00:02:08.019> this

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
the edges all meet at the same time this

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.530 
the edges all meet at the same time this
produces<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> very<00:02:09.890> poppy<00:02:10.280> contactee<00:02:11.209> sound

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
produces a very poppy contactee sound

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.110 
produces a very poppy contactee sound
and<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:12.440> may<00:02:12.590> result<00:02:12.799> in<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.430> vacuum<00:02:13.670> being

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and it may result in a vacuum being

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.030 
and it may result in a vacuum being
created<00:02:14.510> between<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.049> cymbals<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
created between the cymbals and the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.310 
created between the cymbals and the
cymbals<00:02:16.400> locking<00:02:16.790> together

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.260 

as<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.770> witnessed<00:02:23.180> playing<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
as you just witnessed playing the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
as you just witnessed playing the
cymbals<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> way<00:02:25.080> produces<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> very

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
cymbals in that way produces a very

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.050 
cymbals in that way produces a very
poppy<00:02:26.280> sound<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.300> no<00:02:27.330> body<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> most

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
poppy sound with no body one of the most

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450 
poppy sound with no body one of the most
important<00:02:30.630> concepts<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.500> playing<00:02:31.890> cymbals

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
important concepts when playing cymbals

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.990 
important concepts when playing cymbals
is<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.330> use<00:02:33.540> what's<00:02:33.810> called<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.320> flam<00:02:34.740> motion<00:02:35.580> in

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
is to use what's called a flam motion in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.210 
is to use what's called a flam motion in
other<00:02:36.540> words<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.110> cymbals<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:38.100> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
other words the cymbals are going to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.960 
other words the cymbals are going to
contact<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.810> side<00:02:40.140> before<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.980> other<00:02:41.160> so

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
contact on one side before the other so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.390 
contact on one side before the other so
there's<00:02:42.150> actually<00:02:42.420> two<00:02:43.040> strikes<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.340> are

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
there's actually two strikes that are

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.940 
there's actually two strikes that are
very<00:02:44.730> close<00:02:45.000> together<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:46.200> order<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.740> play<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
very close together in order to play a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.550 
very close together in order to play a
cymbal<00:02:47.340> crash<00:02:47.550> using<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> flam<00:02:48.330> motion<00:02:48.840> it's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
cymbal crash using the flam motion it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.370 
cymbal crash using the flam motion it's
a<00:02:49.710> good<00:02:49.890> idea<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> hold<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.820> cymbals<00:02:51.180> apart<00:02:51.600> so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
a good idea to hold the cymbals apart so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.320 
a good idea to hold the cymbals apart so
the<00:02:52.530> edges<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.160> not<00:02:53.400> parallel

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
the edges are not parallel

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.350 
the edges are not parallel
this<00:02:55.170> way<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.800> side<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> cymbals<00:02:56.820> will

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
this way one side of the cymbals will

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320 
this way one side of the cymbals will
strike<00:02:57.780> before<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.560> other<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.040> produce<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
strike before the other and produce a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:10.130 
strike before the other and produce a
nice<00:03:00.630> thick<00:03:01.260> flam<00:03:01.980> sound<00:03:08.660> once<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:09.990> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
nice thick flam sound once you have the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.280 
nice thick flam sound once you have the
concept<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.770> flam<00:03:11.130> sound<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:12.870> nice<00:03:13.110> to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
concept of the flam sound it's nice to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.680 
concept of the flam sound it's nice to
think<00:03:13.350> about<00:03:13.740> two<00:03:14.010> circles<00:03:14.600> rotating<00:03:15.600> in

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
think about two circles rotating in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.699 
think about two circles rotating in
opposite<00:03:16.140> directions<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> cymbals

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
opposite directions with the cymbals

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:43.010 
opposite directions with the cymbals
striking<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.209> middle

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.930 

playing<00:03:44.020> cymbal<00:03:44.500> softly<00:03:45.010> presents<00:03:45.880> a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
playing cymbal softly presents a

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.050 
playing cymbal softly presents a
challenge<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> player<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.730> should<00:03:48.760> use<00:03:49.030> a

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
challenge to the player you should use a

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.470 
challenge to the player you should use a
very<00:03:49.420> small<00:03:50.020> motion<00:03:50.350> very<00:03:51.040> small<00:03:51.400> circles<00:03:51.940> or

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
very small motion very small circles or

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.600 
very small motion very small circles or
sometimes<00:03:53.050> even<00:03:53.260> leave<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:54.250> symbol

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
sometimes even leave one symbol

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.270 
sometimes even leave one symbol
stationary<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.600> let<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.230> other<00:03:56.440> symbol<00:03:56.950> do

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
stationary and let the other symbol do

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.640 
stationary and let the other symbol do
all<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.610> work

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
all the work

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.410 
all the work
many<00:03:59.650> young<00:03:59.920> inexperienced<00:04:00.250> players<00:04:01.000> are

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
many young inexperienced players are

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.479 
many young inexperienced players are
afraid<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.959> play<00:04:02.080> soft<00:04:02.440> cymbal<00:04:02.769> crashes<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
afraid to play soft cymbal crashes and

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.150 
afraid to play soft cymbal crashes and
as<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> result<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.110> only<00:04:05.440> hit<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.739> tips

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
as a result to only hit the tips

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.610 
as a result to only hit the tips
together<00:04:10.890> this<00:04:11.890> produces<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.459> very<00:04:12.760> ugly<00:04:13.030> sound

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
together this produces a very ugly sound

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.650 
together this produces a very ugly sound
it's<00:04:14.620> better<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.130> always<00:04:15.340> use<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> flam<00:04:16.150> motion

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
it's better to always use a flam motion

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.099 
it's better to always use a flam motion
and<00:04:16.900> very<00:04:17.650> small<00:04:18.010> circles<00:04:18.640> when<00:04:19.419> playing<00:04:19.750> a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and very small circles when playing a

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.340 
and very small circles when playing a
soft<00:04:20.500> cymbal<00:04:21.070> crash
