alright<00:00:01.740> here's<00:00:01.979> another<00:00:02.220> test<00:00:02.669> for<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> SEC

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
alright here's another test for the SEC

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.419 
alright here's another test for the SEC
15-3<00:00:04.879> to<00:00:05.879> measure<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.899> power<00:00:07.290> n<00:00:07.680> versus<00:00:08.189> Power

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
15-3 to measure the power n versus Power

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.650 
15-3 to measure the power n versus Power
out<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.210> I've<00:00:10.170> got<00:00:10.349> just<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.800> standard<00:00:11.790> set

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
out and I've got just the standard set

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.740 
out and I've got just the standard set
15<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.440> i've<00:00:13.530> been<00:00:13.559> using<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.570> with<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
15 that i've been using here with the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.250 
15 that i've been using here with the
two<00:00:15.990> towers<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.270> 27<00:00:18.270> LEDs<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.900> I've

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
two towers and the 27 LEDs that I've

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950 
two towers and the 27 LEDs that I've
shown<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:19.980> other<00:00:20.010> videos<00:00:20.609> if<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.720> got<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
shown in all my other videos if I got a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.550 
shown in all my other videos if I got a
48<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:24.180> doesn't<00:00:24.570> work<00:00:24.750> with<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.230> I've<00:00:25.380> got

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
48 it doesn't work with the way I've got

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
48 it doesn't work with the way I've got
this<00:00:25.740> set<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.460> stand<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> 27<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this set up some stand with the 27 and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.820 
this set up some stand with the 27 and
there's<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> reason<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:30.000> using<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:31.230> group<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there's a reason I'm using a group of

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.750 
there's a reason I'm using a group of
nine<00:00:32.489> volt<00:00:32.790> batteries<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:34.559> light<00:00:34.980> those<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
nine volt batteries to light those and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
nine volt batteries to light those and
compare<00:00:36.829> what<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> SEC<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.640> doing<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.620> 19<00:00:40.620> volt

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
compare what the SEC is doing on 19 volt

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
compare what the SEC is doing on 19 volt
battery<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> given<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> pretty

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
battery and this is given me a pretty

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.279 
battery and this is given me a pretty
good<00:00:43.590> idea<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.399> where<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.270> stand<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
good idea of where we stand with the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.700 
good idea of where we stand with the
power<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.160> versus<00:00:47.760> power<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.620> I'm

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
power in versus power out and what I'm

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
power in versus power out and what I'm
going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.920> show<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> show

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
going to show here is I'm going to show

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
going to show here is I'm going to show
the<00:00:51.510> voltage<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.949> nine<00:00:53.280> volt<00:00:53.640> batteries

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the voltage on these nine volt batteries
they're<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.870> than<00:00:54.930> nine

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
they're a little bit more than nine

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
they're a little bit more than nine
volts<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.829> actually<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.340> seventy<00:00:56.879> four

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
volts it's actually about seventy four

going to hit the hit the light here and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460 
going to hit the hit the light here and
they<00:01:15.960> come<00:01:16.229> on

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.190 

not<00:01:21.470> very<00:01:21.770> bright<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.370> they<00:01:22.520> come<00:01:22.760> on<00:01:23.200> it

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
not very bright but they come on it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.530 
not very bright but they come on it
should<00:01:24.530> be<00:01:24.560> about<00:01:24.860> seventy<00:01:25.550> six<00:01:25.850> volts<00:01:26.390> or

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
should be about seventy six volts or

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.710 
should be about seventy six volts or
better<00:01:27.140> more<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:27.890> closer<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.910> 80<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.510> make

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
better more like closer to 80 to make

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900 
better more like closer to 80 to make
them<00:01:29.870> come<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.280> gives<00:01:31.730> you

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
them come on right that that gives you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.110 
them come on right that that gives you
an<00:01:32.060> idea<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.080> 74<00:01:34.010> volts<00:01:34.460> from<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.700> battery

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
an idea of what 74 volts from a battery

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.700 
an idea of what 74 volts from a battery
pack<00:01:35.450> does<00:01:36.400> now<00:01:37.400> over<00:01:37.700> here<00:01:38.000> I've<00:01:38.300> got<00:01:38.600> my<00:01:38.810> new

pack does now over here I've got my new

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.670 
pack does now over here I've got my new
meter<00:01:40.070> which<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.790> excellent<00:01:41.330> I'm<00:01:41.960> very<00:01:42.290> happy

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
meter which is excellent I'm very happy

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.609 
meter which is excellent I'm very happy
with<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:42.979> far<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.960> measure<00:01:45.229> out<00:01:45.590> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
with it so far it can measure out the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.880 
with it so far it can measure out the
amp<00:01:46.010> draw<00:01:46.310> because<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.630> has<00:01:47.840> filtering<00:01:48.650> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
amp draw because it has filtering and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.920 
amp draw because it has filtering and
shielding<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:53.030> turned<00:01:53.300> itself<00:01:53.660> off

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
shielding in it just turned itself off

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.210 
shielding in it just turned itself off
turn<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.470> back<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:56.290> has<00:01:57.290> an<00:01:57.440> automatic<00:01:57.649> off

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.830 
know i'm going to try the battery pack
again<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.310> see<00:02:29.520> what<00:02:29.670> 74<00:02:30.330> volts<00:02:30.720> on

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
again here you can see what 74 volts on

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.089 
again here you can see what 74 volts on
the<00:02:30.930> battery<00:02:31.319> pack<00:02:31.349> does<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:34.830> bright

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the battery pack does it's not as bright

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.100 
the battery pack does it's not as bright
they<00:02:35.640> come<00:02:35.849> on<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.239> not<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.540> bright<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.900> needs

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
they come on this not as bright it needs

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.070 
they come on this not as bright it needs
more<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.870> now

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
more really but what I'm going to do now

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.130 
more really but what I'm going to do now
is<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.739> hook<00:02:41.010> up<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.849> back<00:02:42.450> part<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
is I'm going to hook up the back part of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.990 
is I'm going to hook up the back part of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the tower let me call the tower and take

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.530 
the tower let me call the tower and take
away<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.510> battery<00:02:48.930> pack<00:02:49.940> put<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> over<00:02:51.239> there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
away the battery pack put it over there

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660 
away the battery pack put it over there
and<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:52.650> going<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.400> I'm

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
and what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.780 
and what I'm going to do here is I'm
going<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.880> measure<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:55.200> voltage<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.190> back

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.640 
to turn this back on watch the amp bra
it's<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> little<00:03:24.900> bit<00:03:25.019> more<00:03:25.760> 24<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:26.910> 25<00:03:27.650> there's

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
it's a little bit more 24 or 25 there's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.150 
it's a little bit more 24 or 25 there's
the<00:03:28.890> lights<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.959> there's<00:03:31.170> my<00:03:31.440> voltage<00:03:31.950> on

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the lights on and there's my voltage on

the<00:03:32.310> back<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:33.060> thing<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:35.130> gives<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
the back of this thing so that gives you

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.030 
the back of this thing so that gives you
an<00:03:35.609> idea<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:36.090> what<00:03:36.540> kind<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:37.230> brightness<00:03:37.829> i'm

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
an idea of what kind of brightness i'm

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.780 
an idea of what kind of brightness i'm
getting<00:03:38.549> at<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> very<00:03:39.840> similar<00:03:40.200> voltage<00:03:40.980> coming

milli amps now here's where it gets
really<00:03:50.340> really<00:03:51.209> interesting<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.769> where<00:03:53.010> I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
really really interesting and where I

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920 
really really interesting and where I
probably<00:03:53.400> need<00:03:53.670> some<00:03:53.700> help<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.630> I'm

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
probably need some help on this I'm

back up I can and what I'm going to do

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.020 
back up I can and what I'm going to do
now<00:04:29.230> is<00:04:29.940> I'm<00:04:30.940> going<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.210> show<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.660> amp<00:04:31.870> draw

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
now is I'm going to show the amp draw

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.510 
now is I'm going to show the amp draw
right<00:04:34.030> there<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:36.700> battery<00:04:37.180> pack<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:38.520> I

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
right there on that battery pack that I

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.360 
right there on that battery pack that I
showed<00:04:39.940> before<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.750> had<00:04:40.930> 74<00:04:41.590> volts<00:04:42.070> on<00:04:42.190> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
showed before that had 74 volts on it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.530 
showed before that had 74 volts on it
and<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:42.700> light<00:04:42.910> up<00:04:43.090> those<00:04:43.240> lights

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
and I'm going to light up those lights

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.440 
and I'm going to light up those lights
again<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:44.650> look<00:04:44.860> at<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.130> small<00:04:45.520> amount<00:04:46.180> of

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
again but look at the small amount of

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.000 
again but look at the small amount of
juice<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.170> this<00:04:47.380> draws<00:04:48.750> point<00:04:49.750> three<00:04:50.410> six

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
juice that this draws point three six

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.680 
juice that this draws point three six
milliamps<00:04:51.640> point<00:04:52.300> three<00:04:52.630> seven<00:04:52.930> millions

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
milliamps point three seven millions

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.170 
milliamps point three seven millions
that's<00:04:55.690> not<00:04:55.960> three<00:04:56.470> milliamps<00:04:57.460> that's<00:04:57.700> point

another battery to this stick this out
of<00:05:15.220> battery<00:05:15.580> on<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:16.170> watch<00:05:17.170> this<00:05:17.670> this<00:05:18.670> is

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
of battery on here watch this this is

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.290 
of battery on here watch this this is
when<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.600> diodes<00:05:20.170> the<00:05:20.860> LED<00:05:21.310> diodes<00:05:21.820> open

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
when the the diodes the LED diodes open

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.540 
when the the diodes the LED diodes open
up<00:05:22.419> completely<00:05:23.040> watch<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.310> amp<00:05:24.490> draw<00:05:25.290> that's

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
up completely watch the amp draw that's

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.330 
up completely watch the amp draw that's
6.53<00:05:27.600> milliamps<00:05:28.600> I've<00:05:28.900> got<00:05:29.200> very<00:05:29.500> bright<00:05:29.800> LEDs

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
6.53 milliamps I've got very bright LEDs

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.630 
6.53 milliamps I've got very bright LEDs
brighter<00:05:31.270> than<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.630> set<00:05:31.990> but<00:05:32.950> look<00:05:33.130> at<00:05:33.250> my<00:05:33.400> amp

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
brighter than a set but look at my amp

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.180 
brighter than a set but look at my amp
craw<00:05:33.910> now<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.780> guys<00:05:35.050> with<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.350> calculators

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
craw now the guys with the calculators

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.640 
craw now the guys with the calculators
they<00:05:36.460> can<00:05:36.640> figure<00:05:36.940> these<00:05:37.150> numbers<00:05:37.630> out<00:05:37.870> that

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
they can figure these numbers out that

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.010 
they can figure these numbers out that
based<00:05:38.919> on<00:05:39.160> what<00:05:39.400> I'm<00:05:39.520> seeing<00:05:39.550> here<00:05:40.020> somewhere

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
based on what I'm seeing here somewhere

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.750 
based on what I'm seeing here somewhere
between<00:05:41.200> that<00:05:41.800> point<00:05:42.100> 3<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.850> that<00:05:43.480> six<00:05:43.990> is

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
between that point 3 and that six is

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.420 
between that point 3 and that six is
where<00:05:45.760> I'm<00:05:45.880> at<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.480> I<00:05:47.230> think<00:05:47.890> based<00:05:48.190> on<00:05:48.370> the

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
where I'm at and I think based on the

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.750 
where I'm at and I think based on the
numbers<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:48.910> I've<00:05:49.240> just<00:05:49.270> run<00:05:50.010> this<00:05:51.010> is<00:05:51.250> doing

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
numbers that I've just run this is doing

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840 
numbers that I've just run this is doing
what<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.120> doctor<00:05:52.570> says<00:05:52.840> it's<00:05:53.080> doing<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.850> was

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
what the doctor says it's doing I was

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.610 
what the doctor says it's doing I was
very<00:05:54.910> happy<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.450> see<00:05:55.570> that<00:05:55.810> come<00:05:56.320> out<00:05:56.440> of<00:05:56.470> a

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
very happy to see that come out of a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.610 
very happy to see that come out of a
9-volt<00:05:57.190> battery
