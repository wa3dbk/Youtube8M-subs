basic<00:00:01.439> motion<00:00:03.710> simplest<00:00:04.710> type<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:04.980> motion<00:00:05.640> is

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
basic motion simplest type of motion is

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.810 
basic motion simplest type of motion is
uniform<00:00:06.600> motion<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.259> heavy<00:00:07.859> ball<00:00:08.160> rolling<00:00:08.700> on

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
uniform motion a heavy ball rolling on

uniform motion a heavy ball rolling on
the<00:00:08.940> floor<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.870> good<00:00:10.170> example<00:00:10.320> an<00:00:11.269> object<00:00:12.269> in

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the floor is a good example an object in

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.160 
the floor is a good example an object in
uniform<00:00:13.080> motion<00:00:13.290> goes<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> straight<00:00:14.730> line

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
uniform motion goes in a straight line

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.650 
uniform motion goes in a straight line
in<00:00:16.340> uniform<00:00:17.340> motion<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.000> velocity<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
in uniform motion the velocity is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.439 
in uniform motion the velocity is
constant<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> spacing<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:21.000> frame<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
constant so the spacing from frame to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
constant so the spacing from frame to
frame<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.140> always<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> same<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:25.410> larger

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
frame is always the same and the larger

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.029 
frame is always the same and the larger
the<00:00:25.980> spacing<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> faster<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> speed<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the spacing the faster the speed of the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.650 
the spacing the faster the speed of the
motion<00:00:30.980> timing<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> spacing<00:00:32.660> determine

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
motion timing and spacing determine

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.030 
motion timing and spacing determine
speed<00:00:34.219> let's<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.390> example<00:00:37.040> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
speed let's look at an example this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.410 
speed let's look at an example this
bowling<00:00:38.760> ball<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.390> 12<00:00:40.320> inches<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.040> diameter

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420

with<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:43.050> frames<00:00:43.379> per<00:00:43.739> drawing<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
with two frames per drawing that is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.850 
with two frames per drawing that is
shooting<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.230> twos<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> speed<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
shooting on twos so what is the speed of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.660 
shooting on twos so what is the speed of

the<00:01:02.790> table<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.780> 15<00:01:04.619> miles<00:01:05.220> per<00:01:05.430> hour<00:01:07.790> now

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the table is about 15 miles per hour now

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.540 
the table is about 15 miles per hour now
let's<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.330> another<00:01:09.570> example

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
let's look at another example

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.969 
let's look at another example
specifically<00:01:11.550> Wiley<00:01:12.509> coyote<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.290> rocket

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
specifically Wiley coyote on rocket

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:36.240 
specifically Wiley coyote on rocket
skates<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.110> classic<00:01:16.110> scene<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:17.869> BP

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:47.230 

we

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.500 

let's<00:01:48.240> estimate<00:01:48.660> Wylie<00:01:49.500> coyotes<00:01:49.950> speed<00:01:50.510> he

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
let's estimate Wylie coyotes speed he

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.050 
let's estimate Wylie coyotes speed he
travels<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> length<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> his<00:01:52.800> ears<00:01:53.130> say

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
travels about the length of his ears say

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.790 
travels about the length of his ears say
15<00:01:54.810> inches<00:01:55.170> per<00:01:55.430> frame<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.390> he's<00:01:57.630> only<00:01:58.140> going

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
15 inches per frame so he's only going

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.940 
15 inches per frame so he's only going
about<00:01:59.010> 20<00:01:59.790> miles<00:01:59.970> per<00:02:00.090> hour<00:02:00.620> there's<00:02:01.620> actually

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
about 20 miles per hour there's actually

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
about 20 miles per hour there's actually
a<00:02:01.980> small<00:02:02.310> correction<00:02:02.670> since<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.300> video<00:02:03.660> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a small correction since that video is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.620 
a small correction since that video is
playing<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.380> 30<00:02:04.770> frames<00:02:05.010> per<00:02:05.400> second<00:02:05.730> instead

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
playing at 30 frames per second instead

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.290 
playing at 30 frames per second instead
of<00:02:06.750> 24<00:02:07.230> frames<00:02:07.530> per<00:02:07.860> second<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.550> he's<00:02:09.000> actually

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
of 24 frames per second so he's actually

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.820 
of 24 frames per second so he's actually
going<00:02:09.810> about<00:02:10.170> 24<00:02:11.100> miles<00:02:11.670> per<00:02:11.850> hour

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
going about 24 miles per hour

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
going about 24 miles per hour
now<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.040> might<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.370> thought<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.640> wily

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
now you might have thought that wily

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.810 
now you might have thought that wily
coyote<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.750> traveling<00:02:16.260> much<00:02:16.530> faster<00:02:17.100> but

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
coyote was traveling much faster but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.270 
coyote was traveling much faster but
since<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> camera<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.630> tracking<00:02:18.990> him<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:20.100> see

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
since the camera is tracking him we see

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.300 
since the camera is tracking him we see
objects<00:02:20.880> whizzing<00:02:21.330> by<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.860> looks<00:02:23.070> fast

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
objects whizzing by and that looks fast

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.110 
objects whizzing by and that looks fast
enough<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:24.720> fact<00:02:25.020> with<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> faster<00:02:26.310> speed<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
enough in fact with a faster speed the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.730 
enough in fact with a faster speed the
objects<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.750> past<00:02:28.170> him<00:02:28.380> would<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
objects going past him would be a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.280 
objects going past him would be a
complete<00:02:29.160> blur<00:02:29.510> which<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.690> uninteresting

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
complete blur which is uninteresting

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.540 
complete blur which is uninteresting
when<00:02:34.290> thinking<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:34.740> motion

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
when thinking about motion

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.240 
when thinking about motion
