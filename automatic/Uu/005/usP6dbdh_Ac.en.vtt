00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 every day the time for us 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.759
 to mount the summary images 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 with gerard king rodolphe enough 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.300
 amazing this step 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.639
 yes and to do fast and effective 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 will manage a figure that was retained with 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 Cedric is the average speed of this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 39 km stage without the riders had 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 cédric need anything today 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 obviously the runners needed 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.400
 to blow a it's true that the day 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.789
 yesterday was difficult and the average 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.380
 is not exceptional then 191 km 500 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.359
 between abbeville and the harbor without big 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.399
 relief the Norman stage does not fail 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.450
 of attractiveness from diet on the 125 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.250
 last kilometers you see it the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 pack is exposed to winds 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 wide along the coastline 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 cliffs of etretat and arrival at the harbor 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 risk of complicating the task of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.649
 sprinters with the city dingoo coast 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.360
 from Ingouville rising to the flame 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.149
 red afilal for punchers 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 but at km 4 there are three attackers on 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.800
 has here perrig quémeneur the runner 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 of europcar whoever is the one who has 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 does the most to escape in front of more than 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 400 kilometers to the front leparoux 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.480
 of time of this tour de France it is 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.550
 accompanied by the rider of the cofidis here 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.309
 even kenneth selling bill scene the belgian 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.659
 and then the one we do not expect on this 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.520
 tour de france but alas daniel 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.830
 teklehaimanot you Eritrean runner 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.299
 who him on this stage is aiming the jersey 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.530
 polka dot yes yes a breakaway 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.030
 interesting since it's the first 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 times since beginning of this tour de france 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.420
 that the platoon let them take 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 more than 10 minutes and then the presence 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 you noted it from damiatte and climate 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 note with a relative tony martin 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 relaxed then at that time of the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.869
 race obviously tony martin is everything 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 smile you see it the runners have 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.220
 a pace we will say peaceful and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 the breakaway is fast moving forward 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 this eleven minutes 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 it will be the maximum a lead that goes 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 quickly reduce to around 5 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.470
 minutes throughout this stage 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.000
 yes simply a strong wind 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.009
 unfavorable and then three riders who 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 did not really give themselves 100% they 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 thought especially about the point of the dgre in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 stern of the jt gpn and that's when the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.420
 first dieppe coast that the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.219
 Eritrean runner managed to win the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.140
 first point that allows him to come back 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.079
 at this point two points of burrito 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.810
 is there in the second coast of 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.969
 Pourville on sea rebelote bis repetita 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.740
 the Eritrean runner passes 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.569
 kenneth 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 the runner of cofidis and so at this 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.250
 moment it is only one point away from 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.870
 polka dot jersey where he had already won 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.489
 the best climber's jersey on the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.260
 routes of the Dauphiné Criterium so that 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.209
 perhaps inspired place he needed 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.950
 absolutely go to the top of the third 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.670
 summit but the peloton was getting closer 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 perilously 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.459
 a compact crowd a bunch of pace 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.660
 moderate so obviously this is going to give 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.670
 ideas to the darling of the French public 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.450
 on the side of the road I want of course 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.489
 talk about thomas voeckler who will be going out 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.019
 after an intermediate sprint he goes 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.920
 quickly take the advanced we go the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 see on this attack 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 but he will get up very quickly what is it 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.890
 that you thought of this attack 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 Cedric he has returned to 50 seconds 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 escaped 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.269
 and then finally he could not butcher 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.250
 the hole and got up and did well 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.420
 a little surprisingly would have of course he 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.950
 did well to get up he had a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.540
 teammate up front in the person of 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.410
 perrig quencher when he saw that he did not 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.269
 could not go in he got 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.769
 immediately noted it was the decision 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.360
 to take from elsewhere it is surprising to 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.620
 see go out like this behind the breakaway 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.090
 while we knew that this arrival 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.220
 was going to smile at the sprinter puncher 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.600
 thomas voeckler that we saw a lot at 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.140
 the back of the pack since the departure of 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.880
 tour de France 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.920
 there will be other steps certainly 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.209
 after the Pyrenees for him 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880
 will reparlera from thomas voeckler had 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.359
 surely need to reassure themselves 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.340
 and there the peloton the cliff of etretat 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.049
 we have seen today landscapes 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.570
 wonderful story told by eric fottorino 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.130
 and the historic moment on the turn of 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.769
 france with daniel keys my note which 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870
 becomes at that moment at the top of the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.359
 linden coast the first runner 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.930
 African wore the polka dot jersey thanks 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.000
 at this point here even got to the top of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.920
 the linden coast the fist lifted the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420
 thumb up is a beautiful one too 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.019
 operation for world cycling and to 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.329
 that moment 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.430
 just after the race of the bridles again 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.260
 a little bit more with the attak of the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.519
 Belgian runner of the cofidis yes a beautiful 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.900
 exploit a beautiful attack it's true that 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.489
 the Belgian rider had appealed to two 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.049
 times to medical assistance he has 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.670
 still found the necessary resource 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.290
 to try to distort company then 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.700
 it was obviously necessary to resist the return 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.840
 of the peloton it was difficult but he 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.520
 does a great feat both the latter 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.800
 kilometers 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.780
 a beautiful number in any case he takes 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.280
 the advanced on his two companions 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.200
 of escape which include at this moment 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.020
 there they will not come back perrig 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.790
 chosen quencher the most combative your keys 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.680
 my note receiving the polka dot jersey 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.180
 the goal is achieved for these two 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.160
 corridors one enters the harbor and at this 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.080
 moment there is still a few seconds 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.360
 for the Belgian rider but he will be 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.750
 resumed swallowing three kilometers from 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.640
 the arrival 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.980
 even if there in this picture we see that 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.960
 the rugy squad behind the wii he 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.280
 just try to resist a 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.930
 little fallen you see him a fight 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.250
 is completely illegal and then we 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.960
 approach of arrival we know that the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.280
 sprinter teams and that's from 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.420
 replace their sprinters so that's okay 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.640
 really quickly impossible to 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.820
 resist a quiet step until then 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.980
 windspils year picked up 3 km from 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.450
 the arrival and there is the tour de France 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.240
 it's the biggest race in the world 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.220
 wait for it on nervousness comes back a 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.350
 more than one kilometer from the finish 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.570
 look at tony martin in the center of 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.310
 the image thanks to the touch the wheel of brent 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.090
 in Cairo and the hilton with shoulders 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.790
 send to the carpet 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.590
 vincenzo nibali and especially my heroes 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.660
 leave to the right of the package 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.310
 he is also taken from aero kintana in the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.720
 fall and its handlebars and in the wheels 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.640
 back and can not get up and 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.690
 tony martin understands that certainly 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.580
 his turn has just ended 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.140
 yes unfortunate fall khimki 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.910
 incredibly will enjoy one of his 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.560
 teammates pure zdnet stybar in 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.570
 benefited for to go out and resist 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.890
 but a lot of nervousness in the final 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.660
 ch'ti park at this moment of the race 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.580
 is certainly not aware that 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.470
 his yellow jersey in his team is at 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.090
 earth he was worth winning one of the most 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.130
 beautiful maybe there certainly the most 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.760
 beautiful victory of his career in 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.580
 solitary 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.840
 here at the harbor and it's true that he wins 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.190
 we can say cédric are a little 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.960
 little in the general confusion 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.490
 yes he took advantage of the good placement he 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.350
 was in front of this fall precisely then 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.660
 he finished as a puncher to resist 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.370
 back from sagan and coke peter 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.680
 sagan second time again I 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.290
 want to tell you and 3rd bryan coquard 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.600
 the tony martin still has not taken over 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.040
 his machine to go up 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.510
 this is the picture he is 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.860
 he is he is accompanied by his 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.930
 partners kid the shot up to the shore 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.240
 yes it is an image that denotes with 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.830
 the joy of zdnet go there we have the joy with 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.510
 the victory of six bars and the distress to 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.980
 look at tony martin we do not know if he 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.570
 will be able to leave tomorrow in any case 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.340
 he looks well touched on the shoulder a 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.310
 yellow jersey in distress is the shoulder 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.680
 at the clavicle certainly the runners 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.150
 will come one behind the other 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.920
 for italy that we see here in 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.110
 dancer is much less serious 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.940
 some scratches nairo quintana to the 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.080

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.580
 no change in the general classification 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.340
