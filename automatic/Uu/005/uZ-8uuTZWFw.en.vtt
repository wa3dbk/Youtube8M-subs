 I have to sleep for my time. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 I think you should think of the refugees as the low ground. 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.199
 The consultant is now 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199

 Other partners in Asia 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.710
 Then again 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.850
 In a project in the United States, 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.190
 Sometimes I have a nose. 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.470
 There are a lot of coverstories. 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.860

 About the project I'm talking about 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.850
 We advise some of our other partners 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.270
 I was writing an email to get it. 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.940
 It's narrow-minded to come. 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.200
 When you are finished, 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.940
 I hope to meet you 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.510
 There's a second indirect report on the restraint. 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.230
 Ready to report 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.410
 Then 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.430
 I do not know if there is a fire or not. 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.009
 I do not know. 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.060

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.590
 I am weak 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.290
 That's right 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.319
 The degree of immersion 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.990

 Balance balance of value 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.190
 It's a hard job.

 10 In 20 years of local time, the first ten years 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 I'm really dead and I've won most of them. 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.149
 I will go back to meet the boss. 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.119
 I can not afford it on weekdays. 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:21.819
 During the week 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.749
 The consultants did not 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.799
 How big is it because it's Cheongju-si. 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.970

 Expanded acquisition 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.649
 We'll look back easily. Of these, I want to capture 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.289
 I was excited. 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.819
 If so, 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.719
 If it goes on, 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.919
 Especially if you are like a person 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.899
 I am living my life with you 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.539
 I think it's a hard job. In absolute terms 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.389
 Not enough 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.349
 Mental aspects and differences 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.389
 Women's courtyard performance facility 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.389
 if one person should solve the problem 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.399
 I do not know the answer to this question. 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.480
 It is important to work together with Lee Kang-seok. 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 I'm dreaming. 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.789
 I'm tired but I do not get tired when I'm cold. 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.309
 If you wake up in the morning, 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.309
 I thought i would love fool 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.069
 That's why I have to live immersed. 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.630
 More important than 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.940
 The rating for the moreover is somewhat lower. 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.659
 So how do you solve it when you solve? 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 Well, I see it's a job that requires immersion. 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.890
 You can afford 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.969
 Matching student Parents also meet 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.169
 So it's not easy. 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.919
 Oh especially the women 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.999
 1 When I choose this job, I do a lot of people. 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.549
 Not only a female consulting but also all such papas jobs 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.519
 When you go out and work 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.679
 In fact, the focus is always 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.329
 It's so big. 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.239
 by the way 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.789
 I am self- 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.049
 I think that makes a difference. 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.519
 Yes I am now 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.519
 The mainstream tech women. 3 1 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.639
 where child friend

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.090
 No newspapers 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.629
 When I go along 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.379
 Bubble next year 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.379
 My family is not good and my husband is not good. 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.919
 Not relieved. 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.159
 It's a big push in the residents' priority. 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.559
 Priority in my life was prioritized 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.999
 I really do what I like. 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.669
 It's rewarding for you. 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.599
 Within 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.599
 It's not the biggest thing in my life. 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.169
 With a friend 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.360
 Although it can be exciting, 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.669
 We shipped 11 units. 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.129
 If your husband asks you 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.550
 I can work hard and work. 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.720
 Having a friend with this priority 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.320
 Actually 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.320
 It is not a survival from 21 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.059
 Busanjin-gu is the best 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:16.789
 In most cases, 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.789
 The declaration of nuclear weapons is not that much, 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.399
 If I do not do this, 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.220
 Women 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.220
 I'm not satisfied with my environment. 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.400
 Thanks for being nice. 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.779
 My husband is taking another player. 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.779
 I quit, I mentioned my husband who could improve. 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.030
 Han Ye Seul 25 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.419
 Is not there a Taegeuk mark for the first time that it is tough? 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.469
 I made a commitment before I made a wireless connection. 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.869
 Overseas 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.229
 at first 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.629
 You have to keep it until 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:54.629
 I do not think I'll be able to do it. 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.589
 In the realm of resources, 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.919
 Finding the way to the precious 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.849
 Whether you are a career man, 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.819
 I think it's important. 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.839
 But now, 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.849
 Kim said infrastructure investment, especially in ranking 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.639
 Because 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.519
 It's true. 

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.379
 That's because they say 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.050
 Busan women give a little 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.860
 Because resources can be burdensome 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.760
 For the first time, 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.860
 For tomorrow 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.270
 Was it about presidential intervention 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.210
 I think it should be high. 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.379
 And then, secondly, 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.710
 In fact, I think I'm a professional, 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:40.199
 I think it's all the same 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.349
 Imsil guns required 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:43.879
 9. 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.990
 General Lee 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.979
 Inside, let's ask for the inside of a normal college 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.759
 Politics is a paragon sale 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.360
 It's a lot of competition for years 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.780
 to do 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.270
 On the one hand, I am a manager 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.439
 How much of a basic loneliness is it? 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.039
 What you can do really well 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:05.810
 For 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.279
 There must be a very deep and profound character. 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.459
 I want to be Syrian in the same 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.189
 I'm not a consultant, I'm in charge of investigating. 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.639
 I specialize in the industrial field 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.639
 If you like me now 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.939
 I have a lot of distributorship records in my possession. 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:27.669
 So if you do not have expertise, 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:30.669
 Among the netizens, 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.289
 Career is Career Woman Benzene in the air 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:36.189
