00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.529
 good in this class now let's be 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.370
 learning a little more about the menu 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.929
 the component menu with the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.620
 selected object, let's add a 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 his physics 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.010
 Let's add a born hit that corrects 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:26.099
 ball and makes it hard though not kind to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.750
 crash impact impact physics took the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:35.210
 ball bouncing something like that on the floor 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.210
 Playboy in what happens 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.090
 he saw that the object fell 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410
 only I can 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.489
 when we try to prove ourselves 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.280
 objects from yunit it already comes with a 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.910
 collision box but not always when the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 people bring something from a program 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.020
 3d this collision box already comes ready to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 People have to add in this case here. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 the collision box you are using 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:27.570
 here is the colÃ­der box ready to come 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.490
 when this collision box was made 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 but if this collision box had not 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 here, remove it, just come here to add 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 physical component a box with a leader or a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 component that is the same 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.890
 in this component here physical box 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 Colombia 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.289
 if you need to adjust some of the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.000
 boxing with lyder here is possible 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.640
 the width sometimes I want the box 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.300
 collision is greater than the box with 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:16.970
 Let's see now, I will not need it. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.970
 to hit him for me already collide with him 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.860
 personal beauty, see you later
