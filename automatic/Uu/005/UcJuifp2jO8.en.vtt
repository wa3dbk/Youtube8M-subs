been<00:00:48.030> freed<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.600> sin<00:00:49.309> now<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.700> died<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
been freed from sin now if we died with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.810 
been freed from sin now if we died with
Christ<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.809> believe<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.160> live

with<00:00:53.850> him<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> since<00:00:55.739> Christ

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
with him for we know that since Christ

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
with him for we know that since Christ
was<00:00:56.430> raised<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> dead<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.989> cannot<00:00:58.289> die

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
was raised from the dead he cannot die

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
was raised from the dead he cannot die
again<00:00:58.920> death<00:00:59.609> no<00:00:59.879> longer<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.300> mastery<00:01:00.989> over

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
