00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.780
Stubbornly, you’re still single-minded

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.520
Looking only in front of you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.440
As for me, they’re too radiant

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.180
Those beautiful, pure eyes

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.840
In the vitreous color of clouds many stars are reflected

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.760
The marvelous color of the sky draws a planetarium

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.720
Entrust your wish to a shooting, it’ll reach a tomorrow

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.320
And someday, it’ll come true; because that’s what I believe

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.220
Stubbornly, you’re not wandering

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.000
But walking straight your path

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.980
You’re chasing after something unreachable

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.740
Without even looking back once

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.300
Across the blue sky, even beyond the horizon

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.240
Only the far away moon’s light shines on us

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.100
Like if we’re on opposite mirrors, the world will go on forever

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.860
And will never change, as if we’ve always been in an illusion

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.320
In the vitreous color of clouds many stars are reflected

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.240
The marvelous color of the sky draws a planetarium

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.260
Entrust your wish to a shooting, it’ll reach a tomorrow

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.500
And someday, it’ll come true; because that’s what I believe

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.040
Across the blue sky, even beyond the horizon

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.020
Only the far away moon’s light shines on us

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.880
Like if we’re on opposite mirrors, the world will go on forever

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.600
And will never change, as if we’ve always been in an illusion
