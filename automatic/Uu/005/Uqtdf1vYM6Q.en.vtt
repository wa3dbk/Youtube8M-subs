pins is used for the PWM for one motor
and<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:11.120> other<00:03:11.299> pin<00:03:11.660> controls<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.530> direction

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
and the other pin controls the direction

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.550 
and the other pin controls the direction
of<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.609> motor<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.780> course<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.139> have<00:03:15.290> two

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
of that motor and of course you have two

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.470 
of that motor and of course you have two
pins<00:03:15.919> for<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.190> other<00:03:16.340> motors<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:17.120> work<00:03:17.299> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
pins for the other motors that work the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.809 
pins for the other motors that work the
same<00:03:17.750> way<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:19.010> PWM<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:21.769> used<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.310> control<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
same way the PWM is used to control the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.930 
same way the PWM is used to control the
speed<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.139> motor<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:27.190> that's<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.400> common

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
speed of the motor and that's a common

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.820 
speed of the motor and that's a common
mechanism<00:03:29.239> for<00:03:30.079> control

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
mechanism for control

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.830 
mechanism for control
no<00:03:31.040> DC<00:03:31.760> motors<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:34.550> can<00:03:34.580> see<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.420> motor

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
no DC motors you can see the motor

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
no DC motors you can see the motor
controller<00:03:36.380> here<00:03:36.800> is<00:03:37.220> an<00:03:37.610> l2<00:03:38.330> 98p<00:03:39.320> which<00:03:39.710> is

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
controller here is an l2 98p which is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
controller here is an l2 98p which is
very<00:03:40.100> popular<00:03:40.730> chip<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.250> take<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> look

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
very popular chip and we can take a look

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.030 
very popular chip and we can take a look
at<00:03:47.060> how<00:03:47.240> this<00:03:47.540> works<00:03:47.930> here<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.680> again<00:03:49.010> a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
at how this works here this is again a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.840 
at how this works here this is again a
prototype<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.810> prototype<00:03:51.590> has<00:03:52.040> our<00:03:53.680> yellow

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
prototype this prototype has our yellow

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.570 
prototype this prototype has our yellow
wheels<00:03:55.850> with<00:03:56.600> yellow<00:03:57.110> motors<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.130> can<00:03:58.310> see

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
wheels with yellow motors as you can see

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.230 
wheels with yellow motors as you can see
there<00:04:00.040> there<00:04:01.040> are<00:04:01.160> no<00:04:01.280> sensors<00:04:01.820> on<00:04:02.030> this

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
there there are no sensors on this

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.960 
there there are no sensors on this
prototype<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.640> programming<00:04:04.640> here<00:04:04.850> is

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
prototype so the programming here is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.380 
prototype so the programming here is
very<00:04:05.240> simple<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.230> rolls<00:04:07.070> around

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
very simple it just rolls around

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.630 
very simple it just rolls around
randomly

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.449 

so<00:04:15.450> here<00:04:15.630> we'll<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:15.930> turn<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.350> on<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.160> watch

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
so here we'll just turn it on and watch

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.570 
so here we'll just turn it on and watch
it<00:04:17.730> yep<00:04:19.519> there's<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.700> time<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.160> beginning

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
it yep there's a time in the beginning

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.880 
it yep there's a time in the beginning
when<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.390> sits<00:04:24.690> here<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.050> waits<00:04:25.620> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
when it just sits here and waits and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.360 
when it just sits here and waits and
it's<00:04:26.070> actually<00:04:26.490> blinking<00:04:26.760> an<00:04:27.090> LED<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.810> there

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:40.499 

there<00:04:32.370> yeah

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.240 

so<00:04:41.509> it's<00:04:41.659> nice<00:04:41.810> about<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.379> switch<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:43.099> can

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
so it's nice about to switch you can

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.210 
so it's nice about to switch you can
turn<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.669> off<00:04:43.819> easily<00:04:44.860> when<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.979> starts

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
turn it off easily when it starts

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.770 
turn it off easily when it starts
rolling<00:04:46.430> over<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:46.879> table

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.860 

let's<00:04:55.780> try<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.379> again

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.800 

see<00:05:01.870> these<00:05:02.080> LEDs<00:05:02.889> over<00:05:03.340> here<00:05:03.849> usually<00:05:04.659> going

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
see these LEDs over here usually going

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.239 
see these LEDs over here usually going
to<00:05:04.900> start<00:05:06.419> changing<00:05:07.419> when<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.499> motor<00:05:08.770> start

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249 
to start changing when the motor start

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:16.170 
to start changing when the motor start
turning<00:05:12.569> you<00:05:13.569> see<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:14.340> do<00:05:15.340> not<00:05:15.490> seem<00:05:15.759> to<00:05:15.819> pity

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
turning you see that do not seem to pity

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:24.719 
turning you see that do not seem to pity
the<00:05:20.099> direction<00:05:22.110> UWM<00:05:23.159> or<00:05:24.159> each<00:05:24.310> one<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.639> those

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
the direction UWM or each one of those

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.170 
the direction UWM or each one of those
motors<00:05:25.270> this<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:25.990> pretty<00:05:26.259> handy<00:05:26.909> when<00:05:27.909> you're

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
motors this is pretty handy when you're

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:37.850 
motors this is pretty handy when you're
debugging<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:34.560> there<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.710> have<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:36.789> DF

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
debugging and there you have it the DF

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.379 
debugging and there you have it the DF
robot<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.789> ant<00:05:40.180> motor<00:05:40.539> drivers<00:05:41.169> you
