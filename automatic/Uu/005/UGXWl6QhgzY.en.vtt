00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.570> think<00:00:00.780> through<00:00:01.020> torque<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.740> little<00:00:01.979> bit

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so to think through torque a little bit

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.710 
so to think through torque a little bit
more<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.310> thought<00:00:02.580> it<00:00:02.669> would<00:00:02.790> be<00:00:02.879> helpful<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.240> do

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
more I thought it would be helpful to do

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.660 
more I thought it would be helpful to do
an<00:00:03.840> example<00:00:04.110> it's<00:00:04.380> much<00:00:04.589> more<00:00:04.890> connected<00:00:05.430> to

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
an example it's much more connected to

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.849 
an example it's much more connected to
engineering<00:00:06.480> as<00:00:06.569> opposed<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.990> our<00:00:07.200> cross<00:00:07.470> Peas

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
engineering as opposed to our cross Peas

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.759 
engineering as opposed to our cross Peas
and<00:00:08.599> choices<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.719> origins<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.530> and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and choices of origins and so on and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.709 
and choices of origins and so on and
that's<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.849> simple<00:00:12.120> sort<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> torque

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that's just a simple sort of torque

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.499 
that's just a simple sort of torque
speed<00:00:14.000> example<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.150> you've<00:00:15.269> probably

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
speed example that you've probably

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
speed example that you've probably
messed<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.990> some<00:00:16.680> back<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.160> Montcalm<00:00:17.580> if<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
messed with some back in Montcalm if you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
messed with some back in Montcalm if you
did<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> Lego<00:00:18.420> motor<00:00:18.690> lie<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.470> blackboard<00:00:19.859> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
did the Lego motor lie on blackboard I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.590 
did the Lego motor lie on blackboard I
think<00:00:20.369> you're<00:00:20.550> still<00:00:20.760> doing<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.270> sure<00:00:21.480> these

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
think you're still doing not sure these

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.029 
think you're still doing not sure these
two<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.840> sort<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> setup<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
two are so the sort of setup here is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.019 
two are so the sort of setup here is
that<00:00:26.310> you've<00:00:26.460> got<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> motor

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that you've got a motor

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
that you've got a motor
the<00:00:27.539> motors<00:00:27.810> hooked<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> wheel<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the motors hooked up to a wheel and the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
the motors hooked up to a wheel and the
motor<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> characteristic<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
motor has a characteristic which is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
motor has a characteristic which is
called<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> torque<00:00:32.669> speed<00:00:32.940> curve<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.480> I've

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
called the torque speed curve so I've

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
called the torque speed curve so I've
drawn<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.020> sort<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.290> typical<00:00:34.649> torque<00:00:35.040> speed

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
drawn a sort of typical torque speed

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
drawn a sort of typical torque speed
curve<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.329> electric<00:00:36.750> motor<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
curve for an electric motor here and the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
curve for an electric motor here and the
idea<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.149> electric<00:00:39.480> motor<00:00:39.690> if

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
idea here is that an electric motor if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
idea here is that an electric motor if
it's<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.340> spinning<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.850> fast<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.510> capable

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it's not spinning very fast is capable

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's not spinning very fast is capable
of<00:00:43.170> applying<00:00:43.559> putting<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> fair<00:00:44.879> amount<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of applying putting out a fair amount of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.369 
of applying putting out a fair amount of
torque<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:45.930> about<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.140> motor

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
torque so if you think about a motor

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
torque so if you think about a motor
that's<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.829> stall<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> you're<00:00:47.760> sort<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that's at stall and you're sort of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
that's at stall and you're sort of
holding<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> sort<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> crank<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
holding the the sort of crank of the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
holding the the sort of crank of the
motor<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> motor<00:00:50.250> will<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> pushing<00:00:51.120> pretty

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
motor the motor will be pushing pretty

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.139 
motor the motor will be pushing pretty
hard<00:00:51.510> against<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.610> whereas<00:00:53.610> once<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> motor

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hard against you whereas once the motor

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
hard against you whereas once the motor
is<00:00:54.329> spinning<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.870> quickly<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.680> actually

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
is spinning very quickly it's actually

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
is spinning very quickly it's actually
not<00:00:56.190> capable<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.879> putting<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.270> very<00:00:57.899> much

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
not capable of putting out very much

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
not capable of putting out very much
torque<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.620> fact<00:00:58.770> there's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> maximum

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
torque and in fact there's a maximum

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
torque and in fact there's a maximum
speed<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> motor<00:01:00.930> reaches<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.530> which

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
speed that the motor reaches at which

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
speed that the motor reaches at which
point<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> can't<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.120> wheel

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
point it can't actually make the wheel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
point it can't actually make the wheel
go<00:01:03.780> any<00:01:03.960> faster<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:05.519> why

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
go any faster and that's that's why

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
go any faster and that's that's why
there's<00:01:06.119> sort<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> torque<00:01:06.720> drops<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
there's sort of torque drops as the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
there's sort of torque drops as the
speed<00:01:08.189> goes<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.760> different<00:01:09.119> types<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
speed goes out now different types of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
speed goes out now different types of
motors<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.320> engines<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.740> different<00:01:11.130> torque

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
motors or engines have different torque

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.070 
motors or engines have different torque
speed<00:01:12.030> curve<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.720> were<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> draw<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
speed curve so if we were to draw the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
speed curve so if we were to draw the
torque<00:01:13.380> speed<00:01:13.590> curve<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> combustion

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
torque speed curve for a combustion

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.490 
torque speed curve for a combustion
engine<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.330> steam<00:01:15.509> engine<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> person

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
engine or a steam engine or for a person

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
engine or a steam engine or for a person
on<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> bicycle<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.759> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
on a bicycle it would look different but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
on a bicycle it would look different but
for<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.930> electric<00:01:19.500> motor<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> typically<00:01:20.100> looks

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
for an electric motor it typically looks

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
for an electric motor it typically looks
something<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.049> reason<00:01:22.229> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
something like this and the reason I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.270 
something like this and the reason I
want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.159> think

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
want to do this I want to just think

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
want to do this I want to just think
physically<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.900> fact<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
physically about what the fact that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
physically about what the fact that
torque<00:01:26.340> relates<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> angular<00:01:27.540> momentum<00:01:27.960> tells

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
torque relates to angular momentum tells

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
torque relates to angular momentum tells
you<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> behavior<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.670> system<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you about the behavior of this system so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.999 
you about the behavior of this system so
let's<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> let's<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
let's think about this and let's just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.690 
let's think about this and let's just
start<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.880> basic<00:01:33.869> principles<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:35.430> have

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
start with basic principles that we have

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
start with basic principles that we have
this<00:01:35.880> wheel<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.079> true<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.040> think

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
this wheel and it's true that if I think

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
this wheel and it's true that if I think
about<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.460> wheel<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.270> isolated<00:01:39.540> system

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
about this wheel as an isolated system

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
about this wheel as an isolated system
so<00:01:40.229> I'll<00:01:40.320> draw<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> wheel<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so I'll draw the wheel and I'm going to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.700 
so I'll draw the wheel and I'm going to
cut<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.880> wheel<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> rest<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
cut that wheel out from the rest of the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.370 
cut that wheel out from the rest of the
universe<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> ask<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.670> interactions<00:01:45.380> cross

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
universe and ask what interactions cross

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.569 
universe and ask what interactions cross
that<00:01:46.619> boundary<00:01:47.040> well<00:01:47.250> there's<00:01:47.399> one

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that boundary well there's one

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
that boundary well there's one
interaction<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> crosses<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> boundary

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
interaction that crosses the boundary

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.560 
interaction that crosses the boundary
really<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.950> assume<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.880> gravity<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
really if I assume that gravity and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
really if I assume that gravity and
there's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.930> gravity<00:01:52.470> normal<00:01:52.770> force<00:01:52.979> offset

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there's a gravity normal force offset

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
there's a gravity normal force offset
each<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.640> wheels<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.360> anywhere

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
each other wheels not going anywhere

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
each other wheels not going anywhere
it's<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> spinning<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.610> need<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's just spinning so I just need to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's just spinning so I just need to
worry<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> torque<00:01:57.540> interactions

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
worry about the torque interactions

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.569 
worry about the torque interactions
across<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.590> boundary<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> torque

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
across the boundary there is a torque

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.539 
across the boundary there is a torque
that<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> applied<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> wheel<00:02:01.469> due<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that is applied to the wheel due to the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
that is applied to the wheel due to the
motor<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.899> say<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> torque<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
motor so if I say that the torque is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.870 
motor so if I say that the torque is
applying<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.219> wheel<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.579> counter

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
applying a wheel that's counter

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.010 
applying a wheel that's counter
clockwise<00:02:06.119> I'll<00:02:06.600> try<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
clockwise I'll try that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.859 
clockwise I'll try that
like<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.459> I've<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.759> torque<00:02:09.090> due<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
like so so I've got torque due to the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.500 
like so so I've got torque due to the
motor<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.440> being<00:02:10.619> applied<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> wheel

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
motor that's being applied to the wheel

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.619 
motor that's being applied to the wheel
and<00:02:11.720> that's<00:02:12.409> the<00:02:12.560> only<00:02:12.860> external<00:02:13.629> interaction

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
and that's the only external interaction

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.180 
and that's the only external interaction
unless<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.080> worded<00:02:15.319> would<00:02:15.470> choose<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.950> include

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
unless I worded would choose to include

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.720 
unless I worded would choose to include
gravity<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.709> fact<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.250> axle

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
gravity and the fact that the axle

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.490 
gravity and the fact that the axle
actually<00:02:20.120> applies<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> normal<00:02:20.900> force<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.409> of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually applies a normal force but of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.780 
actually applies a normal force but of
course<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.830> normal<00:02:22.069> force<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.459> gravity

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
course the normal force and gravity

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.369 
course the normal force and gravity
offset<00:02:23.120> each<00:02:23.150> other<00:02:23.420> exactly<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.170> case

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
offset each other exactly in this case

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.410 
offset each other exactly in this case
so<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.099> could<00:02:25.430> go<00:02:25.580> ahead<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.819> write<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
so I could go ahead and write what the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.059 
so I could go ahead and write what the
governing<00:02:26.780> equations<00:02:27.200> were<00:02:27.379> for<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.709> system

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
governing equations were for this system

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.530 
governing equations were for this system
it<00:02:28.370> would<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> case<00:02:28.879> that<00:02:29.060> sum<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.360> forces

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
it would be the case that sum of forces

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.330 
it would be the case that sum of forces
was<00:02:30.049> equal<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.530> time<00:02:30.680> rate<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.920> change<00:02:31.010> of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
was equal to the time rate of change of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.460 
was equal to the time rate of change of
linear<00:02:32.000> momentum<00:02:32.269> which<00:02:32.900> would<00:02:33.049> be<00:02:33.170> zero

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
linear momentum which would be zero

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.589 
linear momentum which would be zero
because<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.010> course<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.670> isn't<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.360> not

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
because of course this isn't it's not

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.660 
because of course this isn't it's not
going<00:02:36.080> anywhere<00:02:36.140> it's<00:02:36.650> not<00:02:36.739> accelerating<00:02:37.579> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
going anywhere it's not accelerating the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.280 
going anywhere it's not accelerating the
momentum<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.299> system<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.660> not<00:02:38.810> changing

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
momentum of the system is not changing

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.289 
momentum of the system is not changing
and<00:02:39.470> zero<00:02:39.950> because<00:02:40.310> these<00:02:40.430> two<00:02:40.640> forces<00:02:40.849> offset

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
and zero because these two forces offset

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.949 
and zero because these two forces offset
each<00:02:41.329> other<00:02:41.709> whereas<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.799> sum<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.010> torques

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
each other whereas the sum of torques

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.150 
each other whereas the sum of torques
would<00:02:44.959> simply<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.349> whatever<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.890> torque<00:02:46.129> of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
would simply be whatever the torque of

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.520 
would simply be whatever the torque of
the<00:02:46.250> motor<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:46.730> as<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.260> function<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the motor was as a function of the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.759 
the motor was as a function of the
current<00:02:48.680> value<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.400> Omega<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:51.260> has<00:02:51.590> to

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
current value of Omega and that has to

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.360 
current value of Omega and that has to
be<00:02:51.799> equal<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.430> time<00:02:52.670> rate<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.940> change<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
be equal to the time rate of change of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.710 
be equal to the time rate of change of
the<00:02:55.370> angular<00:02:55.640> momentum<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.239> system

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
the angular momentum of the system

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.150 
the angular momentum of the system
well<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.170> angular<00:02:57.440> momentum<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:57.980> system

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
well the angular momentum of the system

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.640 
well the angular momentum of the system
since<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:58.849> simply<00:02:59.209> spinning<00:02:59.510> I<00:03:02.530> simply<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
since it's simply spinning I simply the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.220 
since it's simply spinning I simply the
moment<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.040> inertia<00:03:04.220> over<00:03:04.549> with<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.879> wheel

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
moment of inertia over with the wheel

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.449 
moment of inertia over with the wheel
times<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.410> angular<00:03:06.799> velocity<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.370> wheel

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
times the angular velocity of the wheel

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.539 
times the angular velocity of the wheel
so<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.450> end<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.900> getting<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:10.280> sort<00:03:10.519> of

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
so I end up getting a sort of

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.430 
so I end up getting a sort of
differential<00:03:11.060> equation<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.540> describes<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
differential equation that describes the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.589 
differential equation that describes the

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
tenly time evolution of the system that

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.370 
tenly time evolution of the system that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
says the torque of the motor depends on

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.020 
says the torque of the motor depends on
what<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> current<00:03:18.769> value<00:03:18.919> of<00:03:19.250> Omega<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
what the current value of Omega is and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.289 
what the current value of Omega is and
that<00:03:20.989> tells<00:03:21.620> me<00:03:21.769> in<00:03:22.130> turn<00:03:22.370> what<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.880> time<00:03:23.090> rate

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
that tells me in turn what the time rate

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.170 
that tells me in turn what the time rate
of<00:03:23.329> change<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:26.260> Omega<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.669> now<00:03:28.669> both<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.090> these

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
of change of Omega is now both of these

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.729 
of change of Omega is now both of these
are<00:03:29.329> in<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.480> K<00:03:29.630> hat<00:03:29.840> direction<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.530> could

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
are in the K hat direction so I could

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.379 
are in the K hat direction so I could
simplify<00:03:31.010> matters<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.669> just<00:03:31.790> write<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.150> as

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
simplify matters and just write this as

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.720 
simplify matters and just write this as
a<00:03:32.419> scalar<00:03:32.989> equation<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.340> torque<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.669> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
a scalar equation so the torque of the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.069 
a scalar equation so the torque of the
motor<00:03:34.760> as<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:36.410> function<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.859> Omega<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:38.079> times

motor as a function of Omega is I times
Omega<00:03:39.530> dot<00:03:40.430> okay<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.530> let's<00:03:42.739> think<00:03:42.889> about

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
Omega dot okay so let's think about

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.800 
Omega dot okay so let's think about
what's<00:03:43.280> going<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.430> happen<00:03:43.819> when<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:43.970> first<00:03:44.329> turn

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
what's going to happen when I first turn

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.990 
what's going to happen when I first turn
this<00:03:45.109> system<00:03:45.889> on<00:03:46.040> what's<00:03:46.400> what<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.819> this

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
this system on what's what is this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.180 
this system on what's what is this
differential<00:03:47.480> equation<00:03:47.569> tell<00:03:48.319> me<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
differential equation tell me the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.839 
differential equation tell me the
behavior<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:50.510> going<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.959> be

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.899 

well<00:03:54.689> if<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.709> think<00:03:55.769> about<00:03:56.069> plotting<00:03:56.489> Omega

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
well if I think about plotting Omega

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.429 
well if I think about plotting Omega
versus<00:03:57.359> time<00:03:59.719> well<00:04:00.719> when<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> system<00:04:01.319> is

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
versus time well when the system is

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.319 
versus time well when the system is
first<00:04:01.739> turned<00:04:02.129> off<00:04:02.430> when<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.939> haven't<00:04:03.120> turned

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
first turned off when I haven't turned

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.589 
first turned off when I haven't turned
the<00:04:03.510> motor<00:04:03.659> on<00:04:03.870> yet<00:04:04.200> Omega<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.099> zero<00:04:05.340> right<00:04:06.150> so

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
the motor on yet Omega is zero right so

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.830 
the motor on yet Omega is zero right so
I<00:04:06.629> start<00:04:06.930> out<00:04:07.019> with<00:04:07.079> Omega<00:04:07.499> being<00:04:07.799> zero<00:04:08.129> and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
I start out with Omega being zero and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.970 
I start out with Omega being zero and
then<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.930> turn<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.200> system<00:04:10.530> on

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
then I turn the system on

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
then I turn the system on
well<00:04:11.099> Omega<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.639> zero<00:04:11.969> when<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:12.299> first<00:04:12.599> turn<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
well Omega is zero when I first turn the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.209 
well Omega is zero when I first turn the
system<00:04:13.049> on<00:04:13.230> Omega<00:04:13.560> can't<00:04:13.889> change

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
system on Omega can't change

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.009 
system on Omega can't change
instantaneously<00:04:14.700> because<00:04:15.269> Omega<00:04:15.480> tells<00:04:15.870> me

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
instantaneously because Omega tells me

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.180 
instantaneously because Omega tells me
what<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.199> angular<00:04:16.470> momentum<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.919> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
what the angular momentum is and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.740 
what the angular momentum is and
momentum<00:04:17.579> can<00:04:17.759> change<00:04:17.789> instantaneously

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
momentum can change instantaneously

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.689 
momentum can change instantaneously
so<00:04:19.289> initially<00:04:19.799> Omega<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.190> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.459> zero

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
so initially Omega is going to be zero

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.390 
so initially Omega is going to be zero
and<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.030> I'm<00:04:21.120> going<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.329> get<00:04:21.449> a<00:04:21.570> lotta<00:04:21.840> torque

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
and so I'm going to get a lotta torque

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.360 
and so I'm going to get a lotta torque
right<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.180> first<00:04:24.919> connect<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
right when I first connect the the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.610 
right when I first connect the the
switch<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:27.000> lot<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.840> current<00:04:28.110> flows<00:04:28.320> into<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
switch a lot of current flows into the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.980 
switch a lot of current flows into the
motor<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:29.070> gives<00:04:29.220> me<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.370> large<00:04:29.990> magnetic

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
motor that gives me a large magnetic

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.350 
motor that gives me a large magnetic
full<00:04:31.349> magnetic<00:04:32.190> force<00:04:32.430> which<00:04:32.759> turns<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.270> a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
full magnetic force which turns into a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.180 
full magnetic force which turns into a
magnetic<00:04:33.780> which<00:04:34.289> is<00:04:34.410> turned<00:04:34.590> into<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.830> magnetic

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
magnetic which is turned into a magnetic

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.650 
magnetic which is turned into a magnetic
torque<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:36.300> wants<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.780> turn<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.289> wheel<00:04:38.160> and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
torque that wants to turn that wheel and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.960 
torque that wants to turn that wheel and
so<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.870> torque<00:04:40.169> initially<00:04:40.650> is<00:04:40.770> high<00:04:41.009> that's

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
so the torque initially is high that's

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.879 
so the torque initially is high that's
going<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.300> lead<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.690> relatively<00:04:43.259> large<00:04:43.530> time

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
going to lead to a relatively large time

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.740 
going to lead to a relatively large time
derivative<00:04:44.340> for<00:04:44.520> Omega<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.060> initially<00:04:45.449> Omega

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
derivative for Omega so initially Omega

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.400 
derivative for Omega so initially Omega
is<00:04:45.930> going<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.139> go<00:04:46.320> up<00:04:46.470> pretty<00:04:46.680> fast<00:04:47.210> okay<00:04:48.410> but

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
is going to go up pretty fast okay but

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.499 
is going to go up pretty fast okay but
now<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.560> little<00:04:49.770> while<00:04:49.949> later<00:04:50.220> Omega<00:04:51.090> has<00:04:51.270> gone

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
now a little while later Omega has gone

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.960 
now a little while later Omega has gone
up<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.810> bit<00:04:51.990> right<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.740> since<00:04:53.250> Omega<00:04:53.400> has<00:04:53.759> gone

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
up a bit right and since Omega has gone

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.110 
up a bit right and since Omega has gone
up<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.270> bit<00:04:54.479> um<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:56.400> torque<00:04:56.669> is<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.820> little<00:04:57.030> bit

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
up a bit um the torque is a little bit

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.469 
up a bit um the torque is a little bit
lower<00:04:57.300> right<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.530> now<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.580> rate<00:04:59.849> of<00:05:00.000> change<00:05:00.030> of

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
lower right so now the rate of change of

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.249 
lower right so now the rate of change of
Omega<00:05:00.780> has<00:05:01.020> dropped<00:05:01.349> a<00:05:01.650> little<00:05:01.860> bit<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.259> now

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
Omega has dropped a little bit and now

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.350 
Omega has dropped a little bit and now
but<00:05:04.710> still<00:05:04.889> Omega<00:05:05.250> has<00:05:05.370> kept<00:05:05.580> on<00:05:05.729> going<00:05:05.970> up<00:05:06.060> now

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
but still Omega has kept on going up now

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.510 
but still Omega has kept on going up now
maybe<00:05:06.599> my<00:05:06.810> value<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.169> Omega<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.560> here<00:05:07.860> right

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
maybe my value of Omega is here right

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.580 
maybe my value of Omega is here right
the<00:05:09.060> torque<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.419> even<00:05:09.630> lower<00:05:09.780> so<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.289> rate<00:05:10.440> of

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the torque is even lower so the rate of

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.339 
the torque is even lower so the rate of
change<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.949> Omega<00:05:11.220> is<00:05:12.030> even<00:05:12.449> lower<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.900> this

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
change of Omega is even lower and this

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.230 
change of Omega is even lower and this
will<00:05:13.530> keep<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.889> happening<00:05:14.130> as<00:05:14.490> Omega<00:05:14.849> speeds

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
will keep on happening as Omega speeds

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.080 
will keep on happening as Omega speeds
up<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.570> up<00:05:15.659> and<00:05:15.810> up<00:05:16.370> eventually<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.789> torque

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
up and up and up eventually the torque

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.879 
up and up and up eventually the torque
gets<00:05:18.360> small<00:05:18.720> enough<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.199> it's<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.770> the

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
gets small enough that it's that the

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.560 
gets small enough that it's that the
rate<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.220> change<00:05:20.250> of<00:05:20.520> Omega<00:05:20.849> is<00:05:21.030> quite<00:05:21.270> small

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
rate of change of Omega is quite small

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.570 
rate of change of Omega is quite small
and<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.080> sort<00:05:22.259> of<00:05:22.320> asymptotically<00:05:22.949> approach

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
and I sort of asymptotically approach

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.779 
and I sort of asymptotically approach
this<00:05:24.509> Omega<00:05:24.930> Max<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:26.099> so<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.430> can<00:05:26.550> sort<00:05:26.729> of

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
this Omega Max and so you can sort of

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.070 
this Omega Max and so you can sort of
see<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.090> as<00:05:27.210> time<00:05:27.419> goes<00:05:27.449> on<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:28.050> will

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
see that as time goes on it will

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.800 
see that as time goes on it will
eventually<00:05:28.669> approach<00:05:32.180> what<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.360> maximum

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
eventually approach what that maximum

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.740 
eventually approach what that maximum
value<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.169> Omega<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:35.030> okay<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.419> a<00:05:36.449> case

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
value of Omega is okay so this is a case

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.230 
value of Omega is okay so this is a case
where<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.199> actual<00:05:37.530> torque<00:05:38.009> is<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.580> function<00:05:39.120> of

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
where the actual torque is a function of

where the actual torque is a function of
what<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.389> speed<00:05:39.750> is<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:40.229> since<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.219> it's<00:05:41.490> a

what the speed is and since that it's a

what the speed is and since that it's a

that but from a sort of conceptual
