00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
there are actually few cheap mono pots

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.070 
there are actually few cheap mono pots
on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> market<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.439> ball<00:01:25.799> head<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
on the market now with a ball head so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.679

the<00:01:28.080> flash<00:01:28.590> bracket<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.880> great<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the flash bracket is very great so you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
the flash bracket is very great so you
can<00:01:30.900> add<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.619> extra<00:01:32.220> light<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.150> add<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
can add an extra light to it or add a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.499 
can add an extra light to it or add a
microphone<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> recorder<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:38.509> small

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
microphone or a recorder and the small

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.010 
microphone or a recorder and the small
tripod<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.549> extra<00:01:42.119> grip<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
tripod is actually for extra grip so you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.889 
tripod is actually for extra grip so you
have<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.829> two<00:01:44.390> points<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.990> camera<00:01:47.899> more

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have like two points to the camera more

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.880 
have like two points to the camera more
steady<00:01:49.290> instead<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.600> some<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.200> show<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
steady instead of some which show you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
steady instead of some which show you
how<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.840> make<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.649> without<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.670> mini<00:01:57.060> tripod

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
how to make one without the mini tripod

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
how to make one without the mini tripod
you'll<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.659> less<00:02:01.009> steady

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you'll be then it's more less steady

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.660 
you'll be then it's more less steady
so<00:02:02.579> here's<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.299> steady<00:02:03.719> shot<00:02:04.670> however

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so here's more steady shot however

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.109 
so here's more steady shot however
probably<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.659> big<00:02:07.200> advice<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.190> BA<00:02:08.429> try<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
probably a big advice is to BA try and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.260 
probably a big advice is to BA try and
find<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.920> uniform<00:02:11.520> color<00:02:11.879> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
find it all in a one uniform color so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.820 
find it all in a one uniform color so
it's<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.989> fitting<00:02:13.319> as

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's more fitting as

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
it's more fitting as
actually<00:02:14.160> by<00:02:14.400> actually<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.060> black<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
actually by actually in black so you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.590 
actually by actually in black so you
don't<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.010> yourself<00:02:17.160> easier<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
don't see yourself easier in the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.770 
don't see yourself easier in the
reflection<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.060> great<00:02:21.300> setup

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
reflection and also it's a great setup

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.670 
reflection and also it's a great setup
it<00:02:21.960> looks<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.710> proud<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.670> buying<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.960> making

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it looks more proud and buying or making

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.330 
it looks more proud and buying or making
a<00:02:25.830> DIY<00:02:26.190> PVC<00:02:27.150> shoulder<00:02:27.630> rig<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.950> also

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
a DIY PVC shoulder rig and it's also

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.650 
a DIY PVC shoulder rig and it's also
less<00:02:29.730> work<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.050> parts<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:33.480> can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
less work it's all the parts are you can

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.990 
less work it's all the parts are you can
actually<00:02:33.870> buy<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.650> parts<00:02:35.070> directly<00:02:35.490> you
