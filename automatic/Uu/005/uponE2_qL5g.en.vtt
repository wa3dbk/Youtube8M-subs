00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 yes 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.420
 I do not know why 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:31.429
 but not 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.429
 but they will do it for him 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.630
 I started 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.430
 a cup and a quarter of normal flour 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.490
 an egg 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.820
 and 75 grams of butter 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.050
 we use a teaspoon of 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.590
 vanilla essence but you can 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.950
 use what you want about 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950
 chopsticks 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.250
 or a quarter cup of white sugar 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 Hello 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 and food dyes in olive paste 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.860
 no no 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.950
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.890
 add all the ingredients except the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 dyes because those are already the ones going to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 use when we have the mass almost ready 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.610
 and mix until you get a mixture 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.610
 homogeneous 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.540
 ah 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.430
 and add the flour slowly 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.420
 we changed the rods 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 of the beater because those are to form 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:22.440
 a dough mix our mix up 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.440
 form a mass 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.359
 one 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.540
 do not 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:45.930
 on a flat surface we sprinkle a 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.930
 little flour and knead for 5 minutes 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.510
 since we went through 5 minutes we're going to 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.700
 divide our dough into 4 parts or good 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.650
 the parts that you want and according to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.650
 how many colors you have chosen 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.410
 Now we will have our dough 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:05:01.760
 food dyes as we told them 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:05:05.410
 with the paste or liquids and we're going to knead 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.410
 until you get the desired color 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.660
 Y 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.060
 Y 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.060
 since we obtained the desired colors 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.530
 we form balls very well and 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.530
 we go to the next step 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.940
 now let's make our buttons 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.520
 to do we have to make them 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.310
 ball crush it with our hands 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.470
 and make it like a hole in the middle 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.759
 we did it with this that is for 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.409
 grab the corn there it is and we give them 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.160
 a hole in the middle 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.160
 yes 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.050
 ugly glasses the first do not matter 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.810
 because later when you do more 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.810
 tell how it is 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.600
 and we're going to do a teddy we 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.950
 we did with this again and there we 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.440
 our button remains and we do with all 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.750
 the muffins all the buttons that we 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.430
 reach can make them from 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.050
 size they want but we what 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.419
 we made a medium term so that 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.030
 are some cookies or very chiquitas or 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.730
 very big and we do all this and what 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:36.550
 We put in a tray with oil or 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.550
 lard or butter paper 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.610
 now we put them in the oven for 10 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.610
 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.630
 after 10 minutes there is something like that 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.860
 super rich but be careful because they can 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.860
 be a little hot 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.130
