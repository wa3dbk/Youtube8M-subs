00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
crown animations at first I thought was

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.560 
crown animations at first I thought was
a<00:02:39.830> bit<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> gimmick<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.850> really<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.450> you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
a bit of a gimmick but really if you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.660 
a bit of a gimmick but really if you
play<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.040> actually<00:02:43.310> hear<00:02:43.490> like

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
play it the you can actually hear like

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.550 
play it the you can actually hear like
that<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.970> crowd<00:02:44.210> chanting<00:02:44.750> real<00:02:44.960> songs<00:02:45.290> as

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
that the crowd chanting real songs as

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.830 
that the crowd chanting real songs as
being<00:02:46.070> Liverpool<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.720> hear

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
being Liverpool and you can just hear

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.740 
being Liverpool and you can just hear
the<00:02:47.900> chants<00:02:48.260> it's<00:02:48.560> absolutely<00:02:49.160> amazing<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the chants it's absolutely amazing and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.030 
the chants it's absolutely amazing and
when<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.840> score<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.830> thing<00:02:52.010> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
when you score the one thing that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.460 
when you score the one thing that
doesn't<00:02:52.250> know<00:02:52.880> me<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> little<00:02:53.270> bit<00:02:53.420> was<00:02:53.900> when

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
doesn't know me a little bit was when

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.600 
doesn't know me a little bit was when
you<00:02:54.530> score<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.860> don't<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.160> player<00:02:55.370> name

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
you score you don't get the player name

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 
you score you don't get the player name
but<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.000> suppose<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.930> makes<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> bit<00:02:57.800> they're

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
but I suppose it makes it a bit they're

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.560 
but I suppose it makes it a bit they're
trying<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.190> make<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.490> more<00:02:58.640> TV<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.360> and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
trying to make it more TV like and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.820 
trying to make it more TV like and
understand<00:02:59.960> that<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:00.530> may<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.650> an

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
understand that and there may be an

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.140 
understand that and there may be an
option<00:03:00.950> if<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.400> try<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.670> add<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.970> hopefully

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
option if you try to add it hopefully

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.780 
option if you try to add it hopefully
but<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.290> still<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.680> really<00:03:03.710> really<00:03:04.190> cool<00:03:04.400> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
but it still is really really cool and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.360

nevertheless the gameplay wise 60 frames
per<00:03:21.020> second<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.850> amazing<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.330> makes<00:03:23.810> such

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
per second is amazing like it makes such

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.060 
per second is amazing like it makes such
a<00:03:24.200> difference<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.620> didn't<00:03:24.860> really<00:03:24.950> like

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
very similar game to current gen but the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.590 
very similar game to current gen but the
lighting<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> lot<00:03:49.580> different<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600

massively<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.390> lighting<00:03:53.840> has<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.470> course

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
massively but the lighting has of course

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.530 
massively but the lighting has of course
been<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.280> great<00:03:55.489> i'm<00:03:55.610> expecting<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.300> real

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
been a great i'm expecting that the real

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.990 
been a great i'm expecting that the real
big<00:03:56.750> changes<00:03:57.110> for<00:03:57.140> next<00:03:57.290> gen<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.310> come<00:03:58.640> in<00:03:58.820> next
