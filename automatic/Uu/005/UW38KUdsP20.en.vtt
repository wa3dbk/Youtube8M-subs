we're<00:00:00.630> gonna<00:00:00.750> go<00:00:00.989> over<00:00:01.340> conclusion<00:00:02.340> calling

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
we're gonna go over conclusion calling

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.300 
we're gonna go over conclusion calling
in<00:00:02.909> unity<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.300> found<00:00:03.920> occlusion<00:00:04.920> culling<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.250> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
in unity I found occlusion culling is a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.550 
in unity I found occlusion culling is a
rendering<00:00:05.730> optimization<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.750> allows<00:00:07.020> us<00:00:07.259> to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
rendering optimization that allows us to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.820 
rendering optimization that allows us to
ignore<00:00:08.280> meshes<00:00:09.090> which<00:00:09.389> are<00:00:09.719> obscured<00:00:10.679> from

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
ignore meshes which are obscured from

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.270 
ignore meshes which are obscured from
view<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.730> camera<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.530> if<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.950> look<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.219> our

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
view of the camera so if you look at our

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.180 
view of the camera so if you look at our
scene<00:00:14.519> right<00:00:14.730> now<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:15.900> 900<00:00:16.590> draw

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
scene right now we have about 900 draw

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.000 
scene right now we have about 900 draw
calls<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.390> under<00:00:18.690> 30,000<00:00:19.500> triangles

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
calls on a little under 30,000 triangles

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.759 
calls on a little under 30,000 triangles
so<00:00:21.000> we're<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.630> turn<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.320> occlusion

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so we're going to turn on occlusion

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.220 
so we're going to turn on occlusion
culling<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.279> reduce<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> first

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
culling and reduce that so the first

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
culling and reduce that so the first
thing<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.529> want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> game

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
thing you want to do is go to game

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.710 
thing you want to do is go to game
objects<00:00:27.420> create<00:00:28.080> other<00:00:28.349> view<00:00:29.340> area<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
objects create other view area now the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.620 
objects create other view area now the
view<00:00:31.050> area<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> determine<00:00:33.239> where

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
view area is going to determine where

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.770 
view area is going to determine where
your<00:00:33.870> camera<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:36.300> occlusion

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
your camera can be and have occlusion

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
your camera can be and have occlusion
culling<00:00:36.809> work<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.309> need

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
culling work so the first thing we need

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.080 
culling work so the first thing we need
to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.020> position<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.530> view<00:00:40.860> area<00:00:41.219> around

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to do is position our view area around

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990 
to do is position our view area around
the<00:00:42.360> camera<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> quick

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the camera so I'm just gonna do a quick

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
the camera so I'm just gonna do a quick
small<00:00:45.719> test<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.250> view<00:00:47.489> area<00:00:48.260> placing<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
small test of the view area placing it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
small test of the view area placing it
on<00:00:49.620> top<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> camera<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:51.239> filling<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
on top of the camera and not filling the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
on top of the camera and not filling the
entire<00:00:52.079> room<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
entire room just so that I can show you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
entire room just so that I can show you
the<00:00:53.640> differences<00:00:54.120> between<00:00:54.320> when<00:00:55.320> occlusion

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the differences between when occlusion

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
the differences between when occlusion
culling<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.559> I've

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
culling is on and when it's not so I've

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680 
culling is on and when it's not so I've
positioned<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.280> view<00:00:59.550> area<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.329> next<00:01:00.510> thing

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
positioned my view area the next thing

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
positioned my view area the next thing
I'm<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> edit<00:01:02.359> generate

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I'm going to do is go to edit generate

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.039 
I'm going to do is go to edit generate
occlusion<00:01:03.899> preview<00:01:05.360> after<00:01:06.360> clicking<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
occlusion preview after clicking this it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
occlusion preview after clicking this it
does<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.500> calculations<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
does some calculations which take a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
does some calculations which take a
while<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.840> come<00:01:10.049> back<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.920> see

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
while and when we come back we can see

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
while and when we come back we can see
that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.610> significantly<00:01:12.390> fewer<00:01:12.479> draw

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that we have significantly fewer draw

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
that we have significantly fewer draw
calls<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.880> polygons<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> see

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
calls and polygons so if we want to see

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
calls and polygons so if we want to see
exactly<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.600> occlusion<00:01:19.140> culling<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.560> doing

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
exactly what occlusion culling is doing

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
exactly what occlusion culling is doing
you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> top<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.439> scene

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you can go up to the top of your scene

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.080 
you can go up to the top of your scene
view<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.490> select<00:01:24.380> occlusion<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.850> see

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
view and select occlusion now you'll see

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
view and select occlusion now you'll see
many<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> meshes<00:01:27.900> turn<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
many of the meshes turn off this is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
many of the meshes turn off this is
actually<00:01:30.060> showing<00:01:30.270> us<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.860> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
actually showing us that the these are

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
actually showing us that the these are
the<00:01:32.100> meshes<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.729> occlusion<00:01:33.329> culling<00:01:33.360> has

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the meshes which occlusion culling has

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.399 
the meshes which occlusion culling has
deemed<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.530> invisible<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.640> us<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.409> if

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
deemed are invisible to us right now if

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
deemed are invisible to us right now if
I<00:01:37.619> move<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:37.950> main<00:01:38.340> camera<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> view

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I move my main camera out of the view

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
I move my main camera out of the view
area<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:41.040> occlusion<00:01:41.460> culling<00:01:41.490> no<00:01:41.880> longer

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
area the occlusion culling no longer

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
area the occlusion culling no longer
works<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> those<00:01:43.229> meshes<00:01:43.649> come<00:01:43.950> back

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
works so all of those meshes come back

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
works so all of those meshes come back
so<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.600> need<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:45.930> sure<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
so this is why we need to make sure that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
so this is why we need to make sure that
our<00:01:46.530> view<00:01:46.979> area<00:01:47.310> covers<00:01:47.840> everywhere<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
our view area covers everywhere that the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
our view area covers everywhere that the
camera<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> possibly<00:01:49.979> go<00:01:50.220> otherwise<00:01:51.180> your

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
camera can possibly go otherwise your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289 
camera can possibly go otherwise your
player<00:01:52.860> could<00:01:53.100> move<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> camera<00:01:53.729> outside<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
player could move the camera outside of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
player could move the camera outside of
it<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.570> occlusion<00:01:55.530> culling<00:01:55.710> no<00:01:56.130> longer<00:01:56.430> helps

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it and occlusion culling no longer helps

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.170 
it and occlusion culling no longer helps
us<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.409> gonna<00:01:58.500> show<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> how<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
us so now I'm gonna show you how to

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
us so now I'm gonna show you how to
position<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:01.020> view<00:02:01.290> area<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.640> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
position the view area like you would in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
position the view area like you would in
a<00:02:02.969> real<00:02:03.149> game<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.590> easiest<00:02:04.890> way<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> find<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
a real game so the easiest way I find to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
a real game so the easiest way I find to
do<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.719> into<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:06.990> orthographic<00:02:07.380> view

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
do it is to go into an orthographic view

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.410 
do it is to go into an orthographic view
so<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.879> exactly<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:09.810> large

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so that I can see exactly how large

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.850 
so that I can see exactly how large
my<00:02:10.479> room<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.230> don't<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:11.560> any<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.830> that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
my room is and I don't have any of that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.040 
my room is and I don't have any of that
perspective<00:02:12.160> Distortion

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050

the<00:02:14.380> key<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.370> fill<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.000> entire<00:02:16.270> room

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
the key here is to fill the entire room

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.979 
the key here is to fill the entire room
wall-to-wall<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.270> don't<00:02:19.480> want<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> go

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
wall-to-wall but you don't want to go

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.320 
wall-to-wall but you don't want to go
outside<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.370> walls<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.970> keep<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
outside of the walls you want to keep it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.710 
outside of the walls you want to keep it
as<00:02:22.510> close<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.290> wall<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.599> I'm

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
as close to that wall as you can so I'm

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.580 
as close to that wall as you can so I'm
gonna<00:02:25.840> expand<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.620> out<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.980> my<00:02:27.330> x<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.840> z<00:02:29.110> axes

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
gonna expand it out in my x and z axes

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.979 
gonna expand it out in my x and z axes
and<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.819> already<00:02:31.060> positioned<00:02:31.330> correctly<00:02:31.660> in

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
and it's already positioned correctly in

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.940 
and it's already positioned correctly in
Y<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.690> generate<00:02:35.140> my<00:02:35.380> occlusion

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
Y and then I can generate my occlusion

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.570 
Y and then I can generate my occlusion
culling<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.330> entire<00:02:37.690> room<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.040> again<00:02:39.489> I'm

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
culling for the entire room so again I'm

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580 
culling for the entire room so again I'm
going<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.849> back<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.060> edit<00:02:40.590> generate

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
going to go back to edit generate

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
going to go back to edit generate
occlusion<00:02:42.099> preview<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.930> when<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.200> clicked

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
occlusion preview now when I clicked

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.190 
occlusion preview now when I clicked
preview<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.100> didn't<00:02:45.670> actually<00:02:46.050> generate<00:02:47.050> our

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
preview it didn't actually generate our

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.199 
preview it didn't actually generate our
occlusion<00:02:47.620> culling<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.819> reason<00:02:49.090> for

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
occlusion culling and the reason for

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.759 
occlusion culling and the reason for
that<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.630> occlusion<00:02:50.230> culling<00:02:50.260> requires

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that is that occlusion culling requires

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.550 
that is that occlusion culling requires
your<00:02:50.980> meshes<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.760> static<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.410> back

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
your meshes to be static so I go back

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.979 
your meshes to be static so I go back
select<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> meshes<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.330> not<00:02:55.480> move<00:02:55.690> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
select the meshes that do not move and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.080 
select the meshes that do not move and
mark<00:02:56.650> them<00:02:56.769> as<00:02:56.890> static<00:02:57.250> then<00:02:57.790> when<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> click

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
mark them as static then when I click

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.539 
mark them as static then when I click
preview<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.290> will<00:02:59.830> generate<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.430> correct

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
preview it will generate the correct

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.650 
preview it will generate the correct
occlusion<00:03:01.209> culling<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> one<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.060> key

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660

you'll<00:03:14.980> see<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:15.459> yellow<00:03:16.090> cubes<00:03:16.750> inside<00:03:17.260> of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
you'll see these yellow cubes inside of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580 
you'll see these yellow cubes inside of
my<00:03:17.590> view<00:03:17.859> area<00:03:18.160> changing<00:03:18.820> size<00:03:19.290> those<00:03:20.290> are<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
my view area changing size those are the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.699 
my view area changing size those are the
cells<00:03:20.859> which<00:03:21.329> visualize<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.959> sampling<00:03:23.680> rate

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
cells which visualize the sampling rate

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.569 
cells which visualize the sampling rate
for<00:03:24.280> our<00:03:24.310> occlusion<00:03:24.940> culling<00:03:24.970> system<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:26.950> I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
for our occlusion culling system so if I

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.690 
for our occlusion culling system so if I
increase<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.810> density<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.890> those<00:03:30.370> cells

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
increase the density of those cells

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.020 
increase the density of those cells
we're<00:03:31.090> going<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.390> be<00:03:31.510> sampling<00:03:31.930> more<00:03:32.560> often<00:03:33.030> so

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
we're going to be sampling more often so

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.550 
we're going to be sampling more often so
you<00:03:34.120> generally<00:03:34.600> want<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> strike<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> balance

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
you generally want to strike a balance

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.830 
you generally want to strike a balance
where<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.220> want<00:03:36.700> these<00:03:36.850> cells<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.359> be<00:03:37.480> small

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
where you want these cells to be small

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.569 
where you want these cells to be small
enough<00:03:37.870> where<00:03:38.290> they<00:03:38.470> can<00:03:38.709> share<00:03:38.980> information

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
enough where they can share information

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.390 
enough where they can share information
but<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:41.170> don't<00:03:41.500> want<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.799> make<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.040> densely

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
but you don't want to make it densely

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.729 
but you don't want to make it densely
packed<00:03:42.579> like<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.720> is<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.959> little

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
packed like this this is a little

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.460 
packed like this this is a little
overkill<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.519> it's<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.359> take<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.810> much

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
overkill and it's going to take a much

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.030 
overkill and it's going to take a much
longer<00:03:47.890> time<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.160> calculate<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.829> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
longer time to calculate so you want to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.380 
longer time to calculate so you want to
create<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.880> grid<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.180> looks<00:03:52.570> more<00:03:52.989> like<00:03:53.049> this

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
create a grid that looks more like this

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.259 
create a grid that looks more like this
less<00:03:55.390> densely<00:03:55.900> packed<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.739> want<00:03:57.010> a

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
less densely packed but you want a

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.699 
less densely packed but you want a
fairly<00:03:58.269> large<00:03:58.450> number<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.930> cubes<00:03:59.290> so<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.620> we

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
fairly large number of cubes so that we

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.880 
fairly large number of cubes so that we
have<00:03:59.859> a<00:03:59.890> high<00:04:00.340> sample<00:04:00.819> rate<00:04:01.319> now<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.380> number

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
have a high sample rate now the number
