00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
you see that on a lot of the um models

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.000 
you see that on a lot of the um models
from<00:04:42.880> motor<00:04:43.389> arm<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:44.650> have<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.889> single<00:04:45.250> front<00:04:45.490> a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
from motor arm you have a single front a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.920 
from motor arm you have a single front a
hydraulic<00:04:48.010> cylinder<00:04:48.130> for<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.520> bucket

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
bit in there but I think that was my own

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.140 
bit in there but I think that was my own
fault<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:56.560> have<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.950> believe<00:04:57.639> that<00:04:57.820> referred

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
fault you have a I believe that referred

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.390 
fault you have a I believe that referred
to<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.360> six<00:04:58.750> in<00:04:58.900> one<00:04:59.080> buckets<00:04:59.530> because<00:04:59.950> you<00:05:00.190> have

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
to a six in one buckets because you have

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.540 
to a six in one buckets because you have
the<00:05:00.610> arm<00:05:01.289> works<00:05:02.289> as<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> standard<00:05:02.919> bucket<00:05:03.130> which

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
the arm works as a standard bucket which

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.070 
the arm works as a standard bucket which
is<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.849> clamshell<00:05:04.090> bucket<00:05:04.450> working

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
is the clamshell bucket working

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.190 
is the clamshell bucket working
bulldozer<00:05:05.620> arm<00:05:06.099> and<00:05:07.000> POW<00:05:07.479> folks<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.900> think<00:05:07.930> I'm

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
bulldozer arm and POW folks I think I'm

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.500 
bulldozer arm and POW folks I think I'm
missing<00:05:08.320> something<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.889> there<00:05:09.099> but<00:05:09.880> uh<00:05:09.910> these

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
missing something on there but uh these

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.440 
missing something on there but uh these
pallet<00:05:10.990> forks<00:05:12.030> which<00:05:13.470> they<00:05:14.470> look<00:05:14.680> pretty<00:05:14.979> cool

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
pallet forks which they look pretty cool

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.159 
pallet forks which they look pretty cool
but<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:16.510> think<00:05:17.110> they<00:05:17.710> could<00:05:17.889> be<00:05:17.919> better

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
but I think they could be better

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.350 
but I think they could be better
personally<00:05:20.169> but<00:05:20.919> they<00:05:21.280> do<00:05:21.610> look<00:05:21.880> pretty<00:05:22.030> cool

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
personally but they do look pretty cool

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.970 
personally but they do look pretty cool
I<00:05:22.539> like<00:05:22.870> them<00:05:23.050> they<00:05:23.260> flip<00:05:23.530> up

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.660 

like<00:05:28.700> so<00:05:29.830> out<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.130> way<00:05:31.220> when<00:05:31.400> you're<00:05:31.550> not

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
like so out of the way when you're not

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
like so out of the way when you're not
using<00:05:31.910> them<00:05:32.090> are<00:05:32.270> using<00:05:32.540> the<00:05:32.660> loader<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:34.690> this

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
using them are using the loader and this

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.050 
using them are using the loader and this
one<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.290> really<00:05:36.800> stiff<00:05:37.040> this<00:05:37.250> one<00:05:37.490> is<00:05:37.640> really

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
one is really stiff this one is really

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.730 
one is really stiff this one is really
loose<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:38.390> that<00:05:38.720> one<00:05:38.900> flops<00:05:39.230> down<00:05:39.440> all<00:05:39.650> the

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
loose so that one flops down all the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.960 
loose so that one flops down all the
time<00:05:39.890> and<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.100> one<00:05:40.280> is<00:05:40.340> just<00:05:40.520> chilling<00:05:40.790> that

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
time and that one is just chilling that

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.220 
time and that one is just chilling that

often on a loader backhoe model and it

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:04.629 
often on a loader backhoe model and it
opens<00:05:52.820> up<00:05:52.910> like<00:05:53.210> soap

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639
