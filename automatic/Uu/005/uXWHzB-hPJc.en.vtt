00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.800 
the water in it it settles on the sand
then<00:02:32.370> i<00:02:32.460> siphon<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.690> what

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
then i siphon it out but really what

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.150 
then i siphon it out but really what
needs<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> happen<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.770> need<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.010> put

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
needs to happen is I just need to put

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.110 
needs to happen is I just need to put
some<00:02:35.370> new<00:02:35.550> clinging<00:02:37.550> filter<00:02:38.550> pads<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
some new clinging filter pads and the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.800 
some new clinging filter pads and the
canister<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.780> fx5<00:02:40.310> or<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.490> sponge

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
canister and the fx5 or in the sponge

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.860 
canister and the fx5 or in the sponge
put<00:02:42.810> some<00:02:42.960> new<00:02:43.080> sponges<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.750> then<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
put some new sponges in and then that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.100 
put some new sponges in and then that
will<00:02:45.990> clear<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.380> write-up<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.930> this

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
will clear this write-up but but this

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.390 
will clear this write-up but but this
stuff<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:49.440> needs<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.770> stay<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.190> filter

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
stuff really needs to stay in the filter

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.340 
stuff really needs to stay in the filter
so<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:52.640> biological<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.730> bugs<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.540> chew<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
so the biological the bugs can chew it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.070 
so the biological the bugs can chew it
up<00:02:58.440> meet<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.450> this<00:03:00.450> isn't<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> help

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
up meet it so this isn't going to help

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.910 
up meet it so this isn't going to help
my<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.930> fact<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.680> guys<00:03:04.860> know

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
my out of fact just so you guys know

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.050 
my out of fact just so you guys know
when<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> did<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.950> ran<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.100> test<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.880> while

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
when I did I ran this test just a while

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.380 
when I did I ran this test just a while
ago<00:03:09.090> after<00:03:09.390> doing<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.720> water<00:03:09.900> change<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:11.550> you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
ago after doing a water change and you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.100 
ago after doing a water change and you
just<00:03:12.540> switch<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.020> for<00:03:13.290> 10<00:03:13.500> seconds<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:16.019> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
just switch it for 10 seconds but it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.340 
just switch it for 10 seconds but it
wasn't<00:03:16.350> all<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.800> way<00:03:16.830> over<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> yellow<00:03:18.350> so

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
wasn't all the way over in the yellow so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.650 
wasn't all the way over in the yellow so
a<00:03:19.920> lot<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> stuff<00:03:20.670> kicking<00:03:20.970> my<00:03:21.209> mum<00:03:21.450> yeah

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
a lot of the stuff kicking my mum yeah

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900 
a lot of the stuff kicking my mum yeah
which<00:03:22.080> I'm<00:03:22.230> not<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.470> excited<00:03:22.680> about<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.459> get

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
which I'm not really excited about I get

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.550 
which I'm not really excited about I get
away<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.450> because<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.050> lot<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.320> plants

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
away with it because of a lot of plants

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.590 
away with it because of a lot of plants
and<00:03:25.920> it'll<00:03:26.100> settle<00:03:26.310> down<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.180> plants<00:03:27.510> will

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
and it'll settle down the plants will

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.110 
and it'll settle down the plants will
feed<00:03:27.810> on<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.040> doesn't<00:03:29.610> need<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.910> out

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
feed on it but it doesn't need to be out

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.890 
feed on it but it doesn't need to be out
in<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.330> fine<00:03:30.540> particulate<00:03:31.050> like<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.900> you

of algae let's see if you see that in

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.580 
of algae let's see if you see that in
your<00:04:57.260> tank<00:04:57.730> in<00:04:58.730> my<00:04:59.720> opinion<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.350> sign<00:05:00.560> that

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
your tank in my opinion it's a sign that

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.310 
your tank in my opinion it's a sign that
you<00:05:00.950> got<00:05:01.160> too<00:05:02.090> much<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:02.450> stuff<00:05:02.720> floating

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
you got too much of that stuff floating

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.140 
you got too much of that stuff floating
around<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.740> see<00:05:03.920> that<00:05:04.100> particulate<00:05:04.760> its<00:05:04.970> kind

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
around and see that particulate its kind

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.530 
around and see that particulate its kind
of<00:05:05.210> settling<00:05:05.480> out<00:05:05.660> now<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:07.510> there<00:05:08.510> are

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
but just enough why a little bit of info

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.060 
but just enough why a little bit of info
this<00:05:38.300> is<00:05:38.420> what<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.720> want<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.200> by<00:05:39.920> the<00:05:39.950> way

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
this is what you want and by the way

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.220 
this is what you want and by the way
that's<00:05:40.370> eco<00:05:40.700> complete<00:05:41.560> slow<00:05:42.560> maintenance

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
that's eco complete slow maintenance

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.330 
that's eco complete slow maintenance
organic<00:05:45.230> dirt<00:05:46.120> higher<00:05:47.120> maintenance<00:05:48.040> big<00:05:49.040> fish

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
organic dirt higher maintenance big fish

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.820 
organic dirt higher maintenance big fish
I<00:05:49.810> think<00:05:50.810> big<00:05:51.020> fish<00:05:51.290> are<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.650> highest

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830
