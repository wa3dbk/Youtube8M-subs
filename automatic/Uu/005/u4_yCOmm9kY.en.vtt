00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
ones like the Sun scars likes appear and

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.449 
ones like the Sun scars likes appear and
they<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.599> metal<00:03:43.930> chest<00:03:44.139> plates<00:03:44.380> this<00:03:45.190> is

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
they have metal chest plates this is

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.120 
they have metal chest plates this is
like<00:03:46.359> this<00:03:46.630> bits<00:03:46.840> metal<00:03:47.109> chassis<00:03:47.319> here<00:03:47.620> I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
like this bits metal chassis here I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.190 
like this bits metal chassis here I
think<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.639> wheel<00:03:48.910> rims

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
think on the wheel rims

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.020 
think on the wheel rims
the<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.340> top<00:03:51.550> half<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.030> legs<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:54.030> joints

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
the the top half of the legs the joints

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.050 
the the top half of the legs the joints
to<00:03:55.150> go<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.450> there<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:56.680> bat<00:03:56.950> plating<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.640> metal

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
to go in there the bat plating is metal

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.180 
to go in there the bat plating is metal
