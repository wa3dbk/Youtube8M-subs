00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.800
 giving up space and machinery so that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:37.040
 collaborate with these people who are 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 breeding will create chicken so that the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.000
 production is destined for slaughter 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.780
 which is being completed within 60 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.929
 days 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 we are organizing space for 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.550
 use is already being 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.559
 used a partnership of the city hall with 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.519
 the organization of the cooperative of 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.670
 small farmers 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.559
 familiarity in the sense that this space 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 can be well taken advantage of 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.400
 it is mostly in the organization and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 preparation of the ration for the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.799
 Semi-caipira chicken that will lower the cost 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 in approximately 20% and this 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.640
 will be the small producer to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.409
 that he can put his product in a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.340
 a condition of equality with others 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.549
 who are there and we know that this support 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 will make it is the small has 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.399
 self-esteem and can actually increase 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.960
 your family income and improve your 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.240
 quality of life and this is the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.890
 is the great partnership of the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 prefecture we assume this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.850
 commitment and certainly agriculture 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.039
 family will have its space in the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.170
 administration together do not like why we 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:54.560
 we know that through it we will move 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.049
 the trade is about two years old and we 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.840
 we have always been talking to form 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.409
 cooperatives and daniel who was always 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.799
 had 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.530
 the debate has to smoke here at school 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.420
 Sunday that most had the factory 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 ration that would lower the cost of 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.510
 by producer 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.050

 His money that he has that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 The right you've been saving is already going to be 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.950
 to help themselves in the part that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.989
 they have to pay to be part of the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.650
 the cooperative 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.810
 then there were 120 people who were 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.930

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.080

 all that the cooperative needed 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.670
 studying all the ideas 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.670
 so the staff is excited 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.920
 then the war we did until 99 left 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.440
 more excited because they started the same 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.150
 we do with little 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.540
 the structure I had the most that is not 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.160
 having here he was not there at the beginning 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.319
 until the president of the daniel cooperative 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.410
 he said that he wanted to know the 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.690
 mayor and deputy mayor because it 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.129
 every month but a team of people who are going 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.549

 and everyone arrives there to here has not 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.510
 support has not been wanting to do well 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.519
 chest and then can not get going 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.739

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.930
 lack of ration the structure of the shed 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.660
 in order to create the movements of the priest 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.190
 10min the chicken at school

 this money that was created what 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.720
 I happen to be growing the share 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.990
 that it will be for the cooperative to do with the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.650
 name here in the future it can finance the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 end was right by producer 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.510
 the firemen there they can start from that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.820
 same way we're just starting out 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.669
 which with little structure is beginning 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.370
 with the structure in the farm today 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:00.139
 reality and thus the secretary of the 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.360
 agriculture asks for it he can 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.039
 with the mayor, he finds a way and 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.900
 everything we do not need until today does not 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.070
 received nothing from the city hall and better 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.070
 despised in the future 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.580
 i 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.590
 is
