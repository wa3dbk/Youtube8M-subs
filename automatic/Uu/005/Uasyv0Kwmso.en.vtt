00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome to Ahmad Kitchen, and today we do Mücver 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 We need you: 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.330
 Zucchini has 1KG, fresh onion 4 and a little parsley, 150g soft cheese, 150g 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.950
 Flour and 3 eggs 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.119
 Salt and pepper 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.199
 Let us start 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.169
 First peel zucchini 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.169
 Ok what we do away 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 Cut a piece of bottom 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 cut 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.249
 Now we rub the whole 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.869
 Last remaining 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.869
 Let's see if a lot of water in it, if a lot of water in it, you have to express it 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.979
 There is very little in it, so you do not need to express 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.359
 Leave it up 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:11.359
 3 pure eggs 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.390
 Then cut the small onions 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.310
 The onion is pure 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 Now cut the parsley 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.240
 Purely 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.840
 Now pepper 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 salt 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.280
 Finally the cheese 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 Need to make small 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.110
 Moves something 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.280
 Flour 150g 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.280
 Let's all 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.850
 We did through the sieve 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.569
 Stir 2 minutes and let stand for 10 minutes 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.970
 I have sunflower oil in a pan 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.900
 We always take a spoon 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 And pure 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.480
 Always with some distance 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.130
 Make the past, well, discount 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.130
 Let's see, now they have good color 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.380
 Auburn, and each rotation 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 It is now also good, we arrest them from 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.350
 On a handkerchief 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.350
 So all of them are willing to move forward, which is now in the past, I will bring them out 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.419
 ready 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:29.410
 migration 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.060
 Ready for it 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.340
 So you can serve them to take the best gagic 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.990
 I wish you good appetite with Mücver so next time, Ahmed, goodbye 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.240
