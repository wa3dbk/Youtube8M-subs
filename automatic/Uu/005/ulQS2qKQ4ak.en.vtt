00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
controller that comes with it feels much

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.370 
controller that comes with it feels much
better<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.060> seems<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.750> respond<00:02:14.170> much<00:02:14.320> better

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
better and seems to respond much better

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
once it's broken in it works very very
