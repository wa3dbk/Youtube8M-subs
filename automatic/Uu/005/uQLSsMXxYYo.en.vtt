00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
said well why we always get plum

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
said well why we always get plum
tomatoes<00:02:06.180> rather<00:02:06.360> than<00:02:06.660> chopped<00:02:06.870> tomatoes

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
tomatoes rather than chopped tomatoes

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
tomatoes rather than chopped tomatoes
because<00:02:07.800> otherwise<00:02:08.460> we<00:02:08.880> tend<00:02:09.210> to<00:02:09.270> find<00:02:09.540> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
because otherwise we tend to find that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.500 
because otherwise we tend to find that
if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.740> chopped<00:02:11.220> tomatoes<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
if you get the chopped tomatoes the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.840 
if you get the chopped tomatoes the
majority<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.170> seems<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.950> top<00:02:14.280> end<00:02:14.550> cut

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
majority on seems to be the top end cut

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.600 
majority on seems to be the top end cut
