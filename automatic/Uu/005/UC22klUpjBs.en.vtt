00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.370 
air the distances is shorter than you
would<00:01:12.210> normally<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.750> you'd<00:01:12.930> normally<00:01:13.050> a

would normally get you'd normally a
normal<00:01:13.470> double<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:15.060> seven

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
normal double would be about seven

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.210 
normal double would be about seven
meters<00:01:15.630> thirty<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.410> an<00:01:16.590> average<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
meters thirty as an average you know you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
meters thirty as an average you know you
would<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> show<00:01:17.910> we're<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.080> about

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
would see at a show we're down to about

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520 
would see at a show we're down to about
six<00:01:19.860> twenty<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.480> we've<00:01:21.600> made<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.840> quite<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
six twenty here so we've made it quite a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.310 
six twenty here so we've made it quite a
bit<00:01:22.650> shorter<00:01:23.159> than<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.370> would<00:01:23.490> normally<00:01:23.670> have

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
bit shorter than you would normally have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.840 
bit shorter than you would normally have
you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> even<00:01:25.740> come<00:01:25.950> shorter<00:01:26.400> than<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you can even come shorter than that you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.870 
you can even come shorter than that you
can<00:01:27.030> come<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.510> less<00:01:27.900> than<00:01:27.930> six<00:01:28.380> meters

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
can come down to less than six meters

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
can come down to less than six meters
but<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> start<00:01:30.300> you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.110> someone

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but as a start you know you for someone

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.330 
but as a start you know you for someone
you'd<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> say<00:01:32.310> something

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you'd want to start to say something

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.380 
you'd want to start to say something
like<00:01:32.820> six<00:01:33.210> thirty<00:01:33.620> but<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:35.460> idea<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
like six thirty but the idea is the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.090 
like six thirty but the idea is the
horse<00:01:36.630> climb<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> horse<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> climb

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
horse climb you want the horse to climb

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
horse climb you want the horse to climb
up<00:01:38.490> landing<00:01:39.360> short<00:01:39.690> that's<00:01:39.930> why<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
up landing short that's why you have the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.580 
up landing short that's why you have the
pole<00:01:40.680> inside<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> yes<00:01:42.570> -<00:01:42.720> landing<00:01:43.229> short

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pole inside so that yes - landing short

front rail smaller the background bigger

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.080 
front rail smaller the background bigger
so<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:25.590> him<00:02:25.770> climb<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.250> into<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.730> air<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
so to make him climb up into the air the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
so to make him climb up into the air the
pole<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:27.569> inside<00:02:27.959> will<00:02:28.170> make<00:02:28.319> him<00:02:28.530> drop<00:02:28.739> down

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
pole then inside will make him drop down

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
pole then inside will make him drop down
short<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:30.270> he<00:02:30.360> takes<00:02:30.599> his<00:02:30.780> one<00:02:30.989> controlled

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
short then he takes his one controlled

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.890 
short then he takes his one controlled
stride<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.670> you'll<00:02:32.790> climb<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.720> get

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
stride and then you'll climb then to get

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
stride and then you'll climb then to get
out<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> second<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:35.489> it's<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.760> teens<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
out of the second now it's in teens a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.660 
out of the second now it's in teens a
big<00:02:36.360> framed<00:02:36.780> powerful<00:02:37.350> horse<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.160> was<00:02:38.370> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
big framed powerful horse so it was it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.370 
big framed powerful horse so it was it
was<00:02:38.819> amazing<00:02:38.940> watching<00:02:39.390> him<00:02:39.870> get<00:02:40.110> through

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
was amazing watching him get through

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.890 
was amazing watching him get through
that<00:02:40.560> today<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.850> when<00:02:42.090> there<00:02:42.239> was<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> mistake

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
that today and when there was a mistake

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.750 
that today and when there was a mistake
or<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> rail<00:02:43.410> down<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.160> didn't<00:02:44.459> seem<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.730> change

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
or a rail down you didn't seem to change

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.100 
or a rail down you didn't seem to change
anything<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:45.930> quite

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
anything and I think that's quite

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.040 
anything and I think that's quite
important<00:02:46.739> for<00:02:47.640> its<00:02:48.060> repetition<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.810> any

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
important for its repetition with any

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.410 
important for its repetition with any
horse<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.340> more<00:02:50.550> times<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.390> more

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
horse the more times you do it the more

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.590 
horse the more times you do it the more
happy<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.290> with<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.420> can

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
happy they are with it and as you can

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.900 
happy they are with it and as you can
see<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:55.170> he's<00:02:55.769> confident<00:02:56.280> doing<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:56.850> he

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
see there he's confident doing it but he

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.370 
see there he's confident doing it but he
has<00:02:57.090> done<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> lot<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.900> know<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.200> not

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
has done it a lot you know it's not

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
has done it a lot you know it's not
something<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:58.860> done<00:02:59.250> once<00:02:59.489> today<00:02:59.700> for

something we just done once today for
the<00:03:00.060> first<00:03:00.180> time<00:03:00.480> he<00:03:00.750> has<00:03:00.989> trained<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.160> a

the first time he has trained on that a
lot<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.549> times<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.569> do<00:03:06.720> some<00:03:07.260> form<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
lot of times I would do some form of

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.550 
lot of times I would do some form of
grid<00:03:08.069> with<00:03:08.250> miles<00:03:08.640> who's<00:03:08.880> once<00:03:09.569> definitely

grid with miles who's once definitely
twice<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> week<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.850> know<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.360> goes<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.840> with

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
twice a week you know that goes in with

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.660 
twice a week you know that goes in with
any<00:03:13.140> other<00:03:13.380> exercising<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.220> hacking<00:03:14.549> up

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
bit of jumping dressage as I call it you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.710 
bit of jumping dressage as I call it you
know<00:03:19.319> that's<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.980> program<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.519> now<00:03:21.480> we've

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
know that's the program really now we've

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.570 
know that's the program really now we've
seen<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> other<00:03:22.440> footage<00:03:23.069> we've<00:03:23.370> done

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
seen on the other footage we've done

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520 
seen on the other footage we've done
other<00:03:23.819> grid<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.720> started<00:03:25.049> with<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.200> cancer

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
other grid so we started with the cancer

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.690 
other grid so we started with the cancer
poles<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.890> then<00:03:26.010> we've<00:03:26.100> got<00:03:26.280> some<00:03:26.489> other<00:03:26.579> ones

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
poles and then we've got some other ones

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.580 
poles and then we've got some other ones
on<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.600> recommend<00:03:27.989> starting

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
on there would you recommend starting

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.110 
on there would you recommend starting
with<00:03:28.769> any<00:03:28.920> particular<00:03:29.130> grid<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:29.850> you've<00:03:29.970> never

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
with any particular grid if you've never

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.180 
with any particular grid if you've never
really<00:03:30.420> done<00:03:30.630> good<00:03:30.840> work<00:03:30.870> before<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.680> would

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
really done good work before I would

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.470 
really done good work before I would
start<00:03:32.489> with<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.700> counter<00:03:33.030> poles<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
start with the counter poles it's the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.650 
start with the counter poles it's the
easiest<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.109> start<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.850> then<00:03:36.359> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
easiest one to start with and then the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.569 
easiest one to start with and then the
second<00:03:37.079> one<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> bounce<00:03:37.709> exercise<00:03:38.310> that's

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
second one is to bounce exercise that's

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.970 
second one is to bounce exercise that's
that's<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.329> nice<00:03:39.510> easy<00:03:39.810> exercise<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.590> build<00:03:40.769> up

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
that's a nice easy exercise to build up

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.789 
that's a nice easy exercise to build up
into<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:42.120> doubler<00:03:42.750> oxes<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.530> more

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
into and the doubler oxes is a bit more

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.819 
into and the doubler oxes is a bit more
specialized<00:03:44.549> it's<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.209> more<00:03:45.799> dependent<00:03:46.799> on

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
specialized it's a bit more dependent on

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.000 
specialized it's a bit more dependent on
the<00:03:46.950> level<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.640> want<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.910> complete<00:03:48.269> it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the level that you want to complete it

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.340 
the level that you want to complete it
the<00:03:50.010> idea<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.730> me<00:03:50.880> with<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.390> exercise<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:52.140> I

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
the idea for me with that exercise is I

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.870 
the idea for me with that exercise is I
want<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> horse<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.010> climb<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.549> you'll<00:03:53.640> see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
want the horse to climb and you'll see

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.460 
want the horse to climb and you'll see
there's<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> bar<00:03:54.390> guy<00:03:54.630> was<00:03:54.750> across<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.440> of

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
there's a bar guy was across the back of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.340 
there's a bar guy was across the back of
the<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.430> second<00:03:56.790> doctor<00:03:57.239> now<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.140> to

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the the second doctor now that is to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.289 
the the second doctor now that is to
help<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.709> horse<00:03:58.920> climb<00:03:59.310> that's<00:03:59.670> only<00:04:00.060> there

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
help the horse climb that's only there

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.699 
help the horse climb that's only there
because<00:04:00.630> he<00:04:00.810> will<00:04:00.930> see<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.530> makes

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
because he will see that and it makes

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.370 
because he will see that and it makes
him<00:04:01.890> climb<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.640> middle<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.239> Aqsa<00:04:03.630> more

him climb in the middle of the Aqsa more
than<00:04:04.680> him<00:04:04.920> go<00:04:05.130> across<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.790> ox<00:04:12.230> always<00:04:13.230> put

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
than him go across the ox always put

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.410 
than him go across the ox always put
that<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.680> in<00:04:13.980> across<00:04:14.280> an<00:04:14.459> ox<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.239> keep

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
that in in across an ox so just to keep

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.599 
that in in across an ox so just to keep
the<00:04:15.569> horse<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.930> climb<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:16.950> want<00:04:17.130> him<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.579> a

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
the horse to climb you want him to do a

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.810

nice<00:04:17.850> arc<00:04:18.180> over<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.810> Ox<00:04:18.930> oh<00:04:19.079> not<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.289> flat<00:04:19.820> thang

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820

and<00:04:21.030> from<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.419> riding<00:04:21.810> point<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.169> view

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
and from a riding point of view

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.450 
and from a riding point of view
obviously<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.800> need<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.039> make<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.220> point<00:04:23.430> that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
obviously we need to make the point that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.430 
obviously we need to make the point that
you<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.789> it<00:04:23.940> look<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.120> easy<00:04:24.600> coming<00:04:25.289> into

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you make it look so easy coming into

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.230 
you make it look so easy coming into
these<00:04:25.620> things<00:04:25.860> what<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.729> what<00:04:27.090> would<00:04:27.180> you

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
these things what do you what would you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.760 
these things what do you what would you
recommend<00:04:27.450> for<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> rights<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.260> do<00:04:28.500> with<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
recommend for the rights to do with the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.190 
recommend for the rights to do with the
approach<00:04:29.070> that<00:04:29.400> come<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.729> and

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
approach that come in and

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.340 
approach that come in and
I<00:04:30.550> mean<00:04:31.550> always<00:04:31.850> starts<00:04:32.150> with<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.390> jumping

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
I mean always starts with you jumping

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.500 
I mean always starts with you jumping
dressage<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:34.160> have<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.520> be<00:04:34.700> confident<00:04:35.270> enough

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
dressage you have to be confident enough

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.940 
dressage you have to be confident enough
on<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.810> flat<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.170> your<00:04:36.290> horse<00:04:36.470> can<00:04:36.710> count

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
on the flat that your horse can count

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.580 
on the flat that your horse can count
around<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.400> corner<00:04:37.730> without<00:04:38.060> arguing<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:39.560> the

around the first corner to a par on the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000 
around the first corner to a par on the
floor<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.750> can't<00:04:45.020> then<00:04:45.290> do<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.560> double<00:04:45.920> of

floor you can't then do a double of
OPS's<00:04:46.370> or<00:04:46.520> your<00:04:46.940> counter<00:04:47.270> poles<00:04:47.450> you've<00:04:47.600> got

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
OPS's or your counter poles you've got

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.990 
OPS's or your counter poles you've got
to<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:48.050> able<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.290> keep<00:04:49.070> your<00:04:49.250> horse<00:04:49.400> balanced

to be able to keep your horse balanced
at<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.300> level<00:04:50.510> before<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.170> build<00:04:51.350> up<00:04:51.530> into

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
at that level before you build up into

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.230 
at that level before you build up into
these<00:04:56.710> now<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.740> start<00:04:58.310> small<00:04:58.550> even<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.150> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
these now I start small even if the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.850 
these now I start small even if the
horse<00:04:59.390> has<00:04:59.510> done<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.990> hundred<00:05:00.320> times<00:05:00.560> before

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
horse has done it a hundred times before

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.880 
horse has done it a hundred times before
I<00:05:01.280> start<00:05:02.150> off<00:05:02.300> small<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.840> easy<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.500> build<00:05:03.740> it

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
I start off small and easy and build it

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:14.080 
I start off small and easy and build it
up<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.070> them
