00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 Sponsor video real man. no real man. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 no build your reality and everybody 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.369
 hi daragie techies swami anonymus and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.949
 we all know how a paid network is x 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.350
 interesting and useful but today I want 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.570
 show you 2 chips one of which 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.880
 so epic that go beyond 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 capabilities of all technical mods 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 The first trick helps us led surge 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.760
 move spawner from one place to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.589
 another for in this need rescued python 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.370
 spatial I / O port to me 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:47.400
 space controller cable 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.750
 energy cell memory card or 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.750
 the echo and the lever that's how these things are crafted 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.150
 so what we need is first of all building 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.450
 such a structure like this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.610
 enough 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 it is on teleport only that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.880
 there are these medium bulbs 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.570
 blocks, that is, extremely blocks, they are not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 teleport so we need to build 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.330
 this construction in three blocks connect 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330
 each python 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.190
 cable here and put here energy 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.300
 cell 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.450
 so that it feeds our controller from me 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.880
 him, respectively, and spatial 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:50.040
 port his widow spatial water 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 port put a card on him lever and here 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.509
 where he disappeared from manners 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
 recorded but this one card of each 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.910
 move for example to the rocking chair which you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.060
 prepare in advance for the players here 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.570
 set means looking for the center or the place 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:14.730
 where do you want to put the rocking chair here and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.280
 here we also put these pythons also 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 she also inserts this from the card 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.080
 here is the middle block 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:33.000
 we connect them by cable we put the port 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.549
 controller checks so now this card 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.690
 Memory of the country in the first slot here 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.230
 put the lever click and voila spy gear 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.970
 you can even prove it works 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.970
 let's take down all the construction 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.720
 and prescribe the night as you see the skeleton 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.090
 to be executed all without problems on it 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.180
 can go to bed if you do paid 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.560
 rocking on the server is not it the second 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.870
 the trick is to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.480
 teleport yourself instead of spammer but 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.110
 You may ask why this is and to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.230
 have yourself a personal dimension like this 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.049
 let me show you get up here in 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.150
 the elevator I prepared in advance so 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.579
 site booths and teleports us just 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.459
 as spavner and we appear in this 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.160
 the location is the exact definition of what it is 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.329
 where but if you try for example 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.329
 something to hold 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.140
 then we can see that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.480
 still a little bit wait and what are we in 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.050
 nineteenth 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.120
 measurement for what is it necessary but to 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.500
 have your dimension personal and do here 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.490
 in fact, all you want to build here 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.590
 such a booth 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:15.460
 but the problem is that this is where 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.730
 we appear surrounded like this 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.190
 blocks invisible and break them can 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.500
 only creative player that is wise 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.450
 admin but or 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.960
 maybe somewhere there are creative players 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.770
 here on this I probably all about this 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.620
 chips and i would really like to thank 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.870
 abstract Ryazan brave he is, he sanek 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.700
 came up with these two chips told me well 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.919
 And I already conveyed this to you all, thank you for 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.530
