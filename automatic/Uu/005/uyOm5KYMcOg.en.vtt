00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.680
 I'm not going to call back I'm just going to 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.290
 go back as soon as he sees me change 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.490
 of position and look at it look what 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.020
 I do and if I start from there 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.559
 was a bit difficult to film at the same time 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:39.980
 time if I start from he goes 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:43.839
 come on without my calling it here's a 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.839
 important smell 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:51.409
 so I keep moving away I do not 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.850
 do not call him eating the bust 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.850
 completely turned out it's not practical 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.130
 he is coming 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.140
 and the change of position on the part 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.140
 clean and the dog naturally 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.820
 it is seen that I had changed position 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.320
 but he still came across another 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.290
 smell so I do the same I move away 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.140
 I do not call him I have the arm 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.140
 completely twisted here is here 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 I stop 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 it's just going on who's watching what I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.720
 do if I change position yet it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.549
 come back and there I change 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:08.459
 that's when I change 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:10.050
 position the dog comes back by filming 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.950
 it's not easy but these poles are 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.950
 completely twisted 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.420
 if I pretend to go from one shot 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.900
 running it makes it come 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.900
 automatically 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.390
 I kick my feet he hears he looks 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:24.440
 what's always going on without calling it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:26.730
 without speaking to him I stop 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.060
 he's going to look at what I'm doing he's going 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.060
 monitor 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.330
 I close my turns is automatically 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.330
 excluded 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.830
 half turn and immediately he follows a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.270
 world where I could have made him a 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.130
 little caress as he came all 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.560
 near me but I have the loin 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.390
 in the left hand and the camera 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.390
 in their right a little bit difficult 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.630
 silly you're too far away of course I have my 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.880
 spitz 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:36.340
 yes it's a good world where we continue 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:44.050
 yeah that's good it's ineo I stay with 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:48.010
 me lino that he left on the track I 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:54.100
 do not want to remind it we do not play 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:05:00.639
 keep going back I'll try 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:05.910
 not your idiotic goal you stay with me nor 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.910
 ideals that you stay with me 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.990
 I hear it's moving in the bushes 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:23.800
 it is Saturday where these goods remains 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:28.120
 with me it's the relou a poor 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.850
 far it's good here mau him rent it 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.850

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.800
 for the killer is with me I do not ask 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.130
 not to stay close to me for 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.220
 the moment I still have a little trouble 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.600
 so the main thing is that he comes back 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:06:00.950
 with me and that he continues his 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:06:03.260
 walk there are very few 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.030
 distraction but nothing at all there 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.070
 there is no dog no humans no 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.830
 vehicle or nothing so that's a lot 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.020
 easier 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.920
 he looks behind nothing vehicles 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.920
 the album and it is very far 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.930
 I stop 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.450
 he saw me I leave it far away and there I 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.190
 let me go it's the reign completely 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:39.550
 hop he saw that I was leaving little difficult 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.550
 to film I do half turn 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.739
 suddenly the receipt 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:55.969
 and always the little caress that 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:58.929
 I could have made him a step without sailing 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.929
 to stop there
