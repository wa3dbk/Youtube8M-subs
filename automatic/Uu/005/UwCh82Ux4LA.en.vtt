00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
getting into this area paying people for

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.000 
getting into this area paying people for
stones<00:06:10.480> so<00:06:11.260> what<00:06:11.410> we're<00:06:11.500> going<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.680> do<00:06:11.830> is

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
stones so what we're going to do is

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.080 
stones so what we're going to do is
we're<00:06:12.160> going<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.310> guess<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.730> me<00:06:12.850> we're<00:06:13.000> going

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
we're going to guess to me we're going

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.800 
we're going to guess to me we're going
to<00:06:13.150> look<00:06:13.300> at<00:06:13.419> these<00:06:13.570> closely<00:06:14.140> and<00:06:14.320> say<00:06:14.470> okay

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
to look at these closely and say okay

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.650 
to look at these closely and say okay
probably<00:06:16.810> half<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.050> weight<00:06:17.440> on<00:06:17.590> this<00:06:17.830> is

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
probably half the weight on this is

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
probably half the weight on this is
contained<00:06:19.660> in<00:06:19.780> those<00:06:19.900> stones<00:06:20.230> so<00:06:20.470> we're<00:06:20.590> going

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
contained in those stones so we're going

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.960 
contained in those stones so we're going
to<00:06:20.770> pay<00:06:20.919> out<00:06:21.010> fifty<00:06:21.340> percent<00:06:21.640> of<00:06:21.760> the<00:06:21.820> weight

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
to pay out fifty percent of the weight

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.630 
to pay out fifty percent of the weight
on<00:06:22.120> these<00:06:22.620> despite<00:06:23.620> how<00:06:23.800> great<00:06:24.220> they<00:06:24.610> look

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
on these despite how great they look

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.880 
on these despite how great they look
they<00:06:25.030> look<00:06:25.150> amazing<00:06:25.419> but<00:06:26.230> we<00:06:26.440> can<00:06:26.590> only<00:06:26.650> pay

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
they look amazing but we can only pay

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.700 
they look amazing but we can only pay
out<00:06:27.010> fifty<00:06:27.310> percent<00:06:28.380> we're<00:06:29.380> going<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.590> weigh

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
out fifty percent we're going to weigh

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.650 
out fifty percent we're going to weigh
them<00:06:30.419> so<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:31.720> weight<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:32.040> 3.4<00:06:33.040> grams<00:06:33.660> 3.4

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
them so the weight is 3.4 grams 3.4

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.430 
them so the weight is 3.4 grams 3.4
times<00:06:35.580> point<00:06:36.580> 5<00:06:37.560> equals<00:06:38.560> 1

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
times point 5 equals 1

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.860 
times point 5 equals 1
point<00:06:39.710> 7<00:06:40.070> grams<00:06:40.280> so<00:06:41.180> that's<00:06:41.300> what<00:06:41.660> we're<00:06:41.780> going

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
point 7 grams so that's what we're going

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.160 
point 7 grams so that's what we're going
to<00:06:41.960> credit<00:06:42.230> to<00:06:42.320> the<00:06:42.410> customer<00:06:42.920> 1.7<00:06:43.730> grams

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
to credit to the customer 1.7 grams

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.830 
to credit to the customer 1.7 grams
