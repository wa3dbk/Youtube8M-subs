00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.530 
unboxed me on all Shannon my hair is
breaking<00:00:14.440> or<00:00:14.800> all<00:00:14.950> our<00:00:15.190> z1<00:00:15.400> about<00:00:15.700> natural<00:00:16.209> and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
breaking or all our z1 about natural and

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.510 
breaking or all our z1 about natural and
do<00:00:17.080> this<00:00:17.320> whole<00:00:17.470> process<00:00:17.680> what<00:00:18.040> am<00:00:18.130> I<00:00:18.220> supposed

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
necessary that i made this video once

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.470 
necessary that i made this video once
and<00:00:23.230> for<00:00:23.380> all<00:00:23.470> so<00:00:23.590> that<00:00:23.890> anytime<00:00:24.400> anybody<00:00:25.060> asks

and for all so that anytime anybody asks
me<00:00:25.600> that<00:00:25.630> question<00:00:25.750> because<00:00:26.110> it<00:00:26.320> has<00:00:26.470> been

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
me that question because it has been

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.939 
me that question because it has been
more<00:00:26.890> than<00:00:26.949> once<00:00:27.340> they<00:00:28.300> can<00:00:28.539> just<00:00:28.750> watch<00:00:29.650> this

stopping all type of chemical processing
to<00:00:35.800> your<00:00:36.040> hair<00:00:36.280> whether<00:00:36.519> it<00:00:36.670> may<00:00:36.850> be<00:00:36.910> relaxing

to do firms which is different from
relaxing<00:00:43.960> firms<00:00:44.320> are<00:00:44.530> supposed<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:44.890> curl<00:00:45.219> the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
relaxing firms are supposed to curl the

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.000 
relaxing firms are supposed to curl the
texture<00:00:45.880> of<00:00:45.910> your<00:00:46.090> hair<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.739> relaxers<00:00:47.739> are

texture of your hair and relaxers are

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.190 
texture of your hair and relaxers are
supposed<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.370> straighten<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.880> so<00:00:49.420> if<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:49.960> want

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
supposed to straighten it so if you want

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.860 
supposed to straighten it so if you want
to<00:00:50.440> go<00:00:50.649> natural<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.550> would<00:00:51.760> be<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.149> basically

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
to go natural it would be to basically

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.799 
to go natural it would be to basically
stop<00:00:53.290> all<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:54.010> all<00:00:54.489> together<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.149> learn

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
stop all of that all together and learn

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.030 
stop all of that all together and learn
to<00:00:55.989> take<00:00:56.170> care<00:00:56.379> of<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.620> herring<00:00:56.920> that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
to take care of the herring that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.770 
to take care of the herring that
naturally<00:00:57.489> grow<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.640> lot<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.969> your<00:00:58.120> stuff<00:00:58.149> this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
video is going to be discussing the two

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.360 
video is going to be discussing the two
ways<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.360> how<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:02.170> can't<00:01:02.500> go<00:01:02.620> natural<00:01:03.070> if<00:01:03.219> you

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
ways of how you can't go natural if you

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.670 
ways of how you can't go natural if you
ever<00:01:03.399> decide<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.420> two<00:01:04.690> ways<00:01:04.899> that<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:05.500> go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
ever decide the two ways that you can go

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.370 
ever decide the two ways that you can go
natural<00:01:06.130> arsenic<00:01:07.119> shop<00:01:07.330> or<00:01:07.690> transition

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
natural arsenic shop or transition

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.609 
natural arsenic shop or transition
starting<00:01:08.890> with<00:01:09.039> big<00:01:09.310> shop<00:01:09.580> some<00:01:10.270> pros<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:11.140> you

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
starting with big shop some pros are you

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.359 
starting with big shop some pros are you
get<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.869> start<00:01:13.869> fresh<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.950> don't<00:01:15.100> have<00:01:15.250> to

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
get to start fresh you don't have to

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.249 
get to start fresh you don't have to
deal<00:01:15.520> with<00:01:15.640> two<00:01:15.819> textures<00:01:16.209> you<00:01:16.929> get<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
deal with two textures you get to

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.290 
deal with two textures you get to
experiment<00:01:17.619> with<00:01:17.979> different<00:01:18.369> lengths<00:01:19.119> at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
experiment with different lengths at

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.109 
experiment with different lengths at
different<00:01:19.780> times<00:01:20.050> and<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:21.910> receive

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
different times and also you receive

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.809 
different times and also you receive
less<00:01:22.539> breakage<00:01:23.050> now<00:01:23.500> your<00:01:23.770> hair<00:01:23.979> grows<00:01:24.310> you

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
less breakage now your hair grows you

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.089 
less breakage now your hair grows you
obviously<00:01:25.330> gets<00:01:25.509> experiments<00:01:26.259> so<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:26.890> not

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
obviously gets experiments so it's not

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.430 
obviously gets experiments so it's not
like<00:01:27.490> when<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.060> transition<00:01:28.750> for<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.050> while<00:01:29.259> and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
like when you transition for a while and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.080 
like when you transition for a while and
you<00:01:29.530> just<00:01:29.740> cut<00:01:30.009> off<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.459> never<00:01:30.670> got<00:01:30.880> to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you just cut off and you never got to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.600 
you just cut off and you never got to
release

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
release

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.220 
release
the<00:01:32.060> different<00:01:32.390> styles<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.870> can<00:01:33.110> do

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230

to<00:01:36.680> be<00:01:36.800> able<00:01:36.860> two<00:01:37.100> textures<00:01:37.490> when<00:01:38.450> you're

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
to be able two textures when you're

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.660 
to be able two textures when you're
transitioning<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.070> do<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.430> both

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
transitioning you have to do is both

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.550 
transitioning you have to do is both
your<00:01:40.880> relaxed<00:01:41.330> hair<00:01:41.390> Roman<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.020> your<00:01:42.320> turn

here<00:01:42.830> that<00:01:42.980> you're<00:01:43.160> holding<00:01:43.430> on<00:01:43.550> to<00:01:43.760> what<00:01:43.970> if

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
here that you're holding on to what if

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.430 
here that you're holding on to what if
you<00:01:44.210> big<00:01:44.420> chop<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:44.840> don't<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.290> do<00:01:45.410> that

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
you big chop you don't have to do that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.370 
you big chop you don't have to do that
and<00:01:45.920> also<00:01:46.250> have<00:01:46.550> less<00:01:46.850> breakage<00:01:47.390> because<00:01:47.870> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
and also have less breakage because of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.230 
and also have less breakage because of
that<00:01:48.650> point<00:01:49.010> where<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> relaxed<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:49.940> natural

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that point where the relaxed and natural

permed hair and at that point where they

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.940 
permed hair and at that point where they
both<00:04:03.390> meet<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.900> will<00:04:04.050> get<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.380> most<00:04:04.560> precious

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
style results so if you do a twist out

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.690 
style results so if you do a twist out
or<00:04:11.960> right<00:04:12.230> out<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.860> will<00:04:13.010> have<00:04:13.130> two<00:04:13.460> different

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.790 
or right out you will have two different
results<00:04:14.330> because<00:04:14.840> your<00:04:15.020> natural<00:04:15.440> hair<00:04:15.560> has<00:04:15.770> a

twist out that I did about two days ago
but<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:48.890> took<00:04:49.040> it<00:04:49.370> out<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.180> can<00:04:50.420> do<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.870> video

but I took it out so I can do this video
so<00:04:52.040> I'm<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.610> put<00:04:52.670> some<00:04:52.790> eco<00:04:53.240> styler

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
so I'm just going to put some eco styler

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.690 
so I'm just going to put some eco styler
gel<00:04:53.900> on<00:04:54.290> there<00:04:54.470> as<00:04:54.620> well<00:04:54.650> as<00:04:54.920> some<00:04:55.070> water<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:55.580> my
