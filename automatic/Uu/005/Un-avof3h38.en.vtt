you<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:01.989> start<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.289> Ratchet<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.709> up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830

imaginary infinite consorts and so forth
I<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.260> what's<00:02:14.530> interesting<00:02:14.620> about<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.129> is

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
I think what's interesting about it is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.210 
I think what's interesting about it is
sort<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.819> like<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:17.020> know<00:02:17.110> getting<00:02:17.800> better<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
sort of like you know getting better and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.339 
sort of like you know getting better and
better<00:02:18.280> chocolate<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.150> still<00:02:19.750> chocolate

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
better chocolate it's still chocolate

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.729 
better chocolate it's still chocolate
you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.640> still<00:02:22.090> what<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.349> yes

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
you know it's still what it is and yes

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.800 
you know it's still what it is and yes
it's<00:02:24.599> preferable<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.690> other<00:02:26.350> states<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it's preferable to other states that you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's preferable to other states that you
would<00:02:28.960> engage<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.610> ordinary

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
would engage in in ordinary

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.720 
would engage in in ordinary
life<00:02:32.150> but<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.300> think<00:02:33.510> there's<00:02:33.720> something<00:02:33.930> so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
life but I do think there's something so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.240 
life but I do think there's something so
liberated<00:02:35.730> probably<00:02:36.239> because<00:02:36.620> there's<00:02:37.620> less

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
liberated probably because there's less

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.800 
liberated probably because there's less
of<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.700> there<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.599> experience<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.810> everyday

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
of me there to experience the everyday

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.910 
of me there to experience the everyday
non-dual<00:02:43.470> state<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.870> me<00:02:45.989> there

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
non-dual state then there is of me there

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.110 
non-dual state then there is of me there
even<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> full-blown<00:02:48.090> ayahuasca

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
even in a full-blown ayahuasca

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.430 
even in a full-blown ayahuasca
experience<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:52.080> know<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.380> various<00:02:52.410> reasons

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
experience you know for various reasons

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.070 
experience you know for various reasons
so<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.709> think<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.720> again<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:57.840> only

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
so I do think that again I'm only

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.440 
so I do think that again I'm only
speaking<00:02:58.380> about<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:58.860> own<00:02:58.980> experience<00:02:59.549> that<00:03:00.299> it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
speaking about my own experience that it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.890 
speaking about my own experience that it
does<00:03:00.660> feel<00:03:01.340> better<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.790> better<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.360> better

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
does feel better and better and better

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.500 
does feel better and better and better
and<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.470> has<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> lot<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.459> common<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.180> kind

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
and it has a lot in common with the kind

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.670 
and it has a lot in common with the kind
of<00:03:06.569> cosmic<00:03:07.110> adventure

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
of cosmic adventure

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.479 
of cosmic adventure
of<00:03:08.630> psychedelics<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.140> real<00:03:10.489> taboo

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
of psychedelics I think the real taboo

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.490 
of psychedelics I think the real taboo
that<00:03:11.849> Gary<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.390> pointing<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> here<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.349> this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
that Gary is pointing to here is this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.420 
that Gary is pointing to here is this
that<00:03:13.799> as<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:15.360> society<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:17.540> don't<00:03:18.540> even<00:03:18.780> know

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that as a society we don't even know

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.910 
that as a society we don't even know
basically<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.579> there's<00:03:20.940> anything<00:03:21.269> better

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
basically that there's anything better

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.620 
basically that there's anything better
than<00:03:22.920> sex<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.430> drugs<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:24.319> sex<00:03:25.319> with<00:03:25.950> drugs

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
than sex and drugs or sex with drugs

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.440 
than sex and drugs or sex with drugs
that<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.650> fact<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.819> can<00:03:30.060> say<00:03:30.239> at

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
that and in fact I think I can say at

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.509 
that and in fact I think I can say at
least<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:31.470> me<00:03:32.299> there<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.950> thing<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
least for me there is and the thing to

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.210 
least for me there is and the thing to
not<00:03:36.090> forget<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.069> can<00:03:38.280> also<00:03:38.489> combine

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
not forget is that you can also combine

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.470 
not forget is that you can also combine
the<00:03:41.220> non-dual<00:03:41.760> state<00:03:42.290> effortlessly<00:03:44.120> with<00:03:45.120> sex

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
the non-dual state effortlessly with sex

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.500 
the non-dual state effortlessly with sex
and<00:03:46.459> we've<00:03:47.459> talked<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:47.850> bit<00:03:48.000> about<00:03:48.120> like

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
and we've talked a little bit about like

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.460 
and we've talked a little bit about like
how<00:03:49.700> there<00:03:50.700> may<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:50.940> some<00:03:51.690> sort<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.930> downside

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
how there may be some sort of downside

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.319 
how there may be some sort of downside
to<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.859> that's<00:03:53.400> sort<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.670> what<00:03:53.850> happens<00:03:53.880> is

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
to that that's sort of what happens is

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.430 
to that that's sort of what happens is
it's<00:03:54.480> then<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:55.019> seems<00:03:55.709> like<00:03:55.769> for<00:03:56.069> some<00:03:56.250> people

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
it's then it seems like for some people

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's then it seems like for some people
you<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.470> if<00:03:59.040> they're<00:03:59.639> not<00:03:59.760> celibate<00:04:01.040> then

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you know if they're not celibate then

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.849 
you know if they're not celibate then
the<00:04:02.790> non-dual<00:04:03.269> state<00:04:03.299> kind<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.109> decreases<00:04:04.680> for

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
the non-dual state kind of decreases for

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.440 
the non-dual state kind of decreases for
a<00:04:04.920> while<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.579> don't<00:04:05.760> really<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.000> we<00:04:06.329> have

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
a while but I don't really think we have

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.289 
a while but I don't really think we have
a<00:04:06.480> big<00:04:06.690> enough<00:04:06.930> sample<00:04:07.920> size<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.180> if

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
a big enough sample size to know if

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.030 
a big enough sample size to know if
that's<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.600> case<00:04:09.870> or<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:10.319> that<00:04:10.440> has<00:04:10.739> other

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that's the case or if that has other

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.120 
that's the case or if that has other
variables<00:04:12.109> that's<00:04:13.109> a<00:04:13.200> transient<00:04:13.680> phenomena

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
variables that's a transient phenomena

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.129 
variables that's a transient phenomena
the<00:04:14.340> other<00:04:14.489> thing<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.940> sitting<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.930> doula

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
the other thing is sitting on doula

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.219 
the other thing is sitting on doula
states<00:04:16.380> here<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.760> sex<00:04:18.030> then<00:04:18.840> what

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
states here and you have sex then what

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.629 
states here and you have sex then what
seems<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> happen<00:04:19.859> what<00:04:20.160> feels<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.519> it

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
seems to happen what feels like it

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.360 
seems to happen what feels like it
happens<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:22.470> still<00:04:22.680> keep<00:04:22.889> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
the sweetness comes out of it so it does

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.620 
the sweetness comes out of it so it does
we<00:04:28.470> talked<00:04:28.650> down<00:04:29.250> some<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.090> recovers<00:04:30.570> very

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
we talked down some but it recovers very

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.170 
we talked down some but it recovers very
quickly<00:04:30.810> even<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.590> an<00:04:31.680> old<00:04:31.860> person<00:04:32.180> recovery

think<00:05:21.370> sex<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.240> me<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.510> such<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:24.240> primal<00:05:25.240> heavily

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
think sex to me is such a primal heavily

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.170 
think sex to me is such a primal heavily
encoded<00:05:26.530> or<00:05:26.710> winningly<00:05:27.039> supported<00:05:29.010> neuro

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
encoded or winningly supported neuro

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.090 
encoded or winningly supported neuro
chemically<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.330> for<00:05:31.510> reinforced<00:05:32.139> phenomena

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
chemically and for reinforced phenomena

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.159 
chemically and for reinforced phenomena
it<00:05:33.550> has<00:05:33.699> to<00:05:33.850> be<00:05:33.970> which<00:05:34.360> we<00:05:34.539> have<00:05:34.660> 7<00:05:35.020> billion

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
it has to be which we have 7 billion

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.620 
it has to be which we have 7 billion
people<00:05:35.460> but<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:37.000> think<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.300> don't<00:05:37.449> think<00:05:37.570> he

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
people but I I think I don't think he

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.320 
people but I I think I don't think he
can<00:05:37.750> stand<00:05:38.050> by<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.680> just<00:05:38.800> say<00:05:38.949> yeah<00:05:39.940> don't<00:05:40.210> do

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
can stand by and just say yeah don't do

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.480 
can stand by and just say yeah don't do
that<00:05:40.539> don't<00:05:40.690> do<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.949> hope<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.400> get

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
that don't do that and hope you get

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.100 
that don't do that and hope you get
spiritual<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.150> don't<00:05:43.509> think<00:05:43.690> it<00:05:43.780> doesn't<00:05:44.020> work

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
spiritual I don't think it doesn't work

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.719 
spiritual I don't think it doesn't work
that<00:05:44.139> way<00:05:44.349> I<00:05:44.710> think<00:05:45.039> sex<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.400> when<00:05:45.550> you've<00:05:45.699> got

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
that way I think sex is when you've got

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.260 
that way I think sex is when you've got
to<00:05:45.940> go<00:05:46.030> into<00:05:46.740> Bo<00:05:47.740> attics<00:05:48.070> you<00:05:48.460> know<00:05:48.550> explore<00:05:49.060> it

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
to go into Bo attics you know explore it

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.080 
to go into Bo attics you know explore it
understand<00:05:49.960> it

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
understand it

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.939 
understand it
touch<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.270> depths<00:05:52.599> of<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.840> and<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.650> can<00:05:53.830> move

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
touch the depths of it and you can move

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.290 
touch the depths of it and you can move
on<00:05:54.160> from<00:05:54.400> there<00:05:54.580> but<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.789> don't<00:05:54.970> think<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.180> can

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
on from there but I don't think you can

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.240 
on from there but I don't think you can
just<00:05:55.419> do<00:05:55.780> this<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.229> sex<00:05:56.470> get<00:05:56.860> part<00:05:57.070> of<00:05:57.099> the<00:05:57.220> way

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
just do this to sex get part of the way

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.740 
just do this to sex get part of the way
but<00:05:57.789> there<00:05:57.910> are<00:05:58.030> things<00:05:58.240> that<00:05:58.389> we've<00:05:58.630> been

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
but there are things that we've been

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.500 
but there are things that we've been
saying<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.979> are<00:06:00.130> really<00:06:00.490> more<00:06:01.000> intense<00:06:01.330> than

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.379 
you know I mean to really go into sex in
the<00:06:17.530> way<00:06:17.650> that<00:06:17.830> you're<00:06:17.949> describing<00:06:18.389> actually

that's where it can be actually part of
