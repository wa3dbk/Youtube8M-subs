00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.600
 during the hearing 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 not an exception 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.109
 it didnâ€™t become like that and I know through 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.539
 Novorossiysk regions 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.710
 she bought it will send Tokyo 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.269
 Isn't it time for me to Canadians also 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.619
 from teams 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 without that weak address it has 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.230
 mandate and division specialists 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.899
 besides 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.350
 and so 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.970
 this is not a one-time action of the national assembly 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.610
 Dagestan 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 I think so for Turkey 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.120
 for us we have an official 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.540
 warning 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 i.e 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 workshops round tables master classes with 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 Yes, we know for what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.300
 the purpose and finances of the arrest will surely become 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.149
 American 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.149
 during the session gas 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.700
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 provide her and a half and a half and Victor 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.860
 Safonov understand 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.240
 rose by flaws and times 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.280
 prosecutor's office aggravated pores 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 natural heritage and because 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 the question probably hurts the line 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 of behavior 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.500
 Republican 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 etc 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.170
 for making such words request 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.859
 or 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.590
 and working there 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.540
 they have experienced suburban 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 before shooting 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.910
 I say this recalculation 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.350
 and the project issue the company bought 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 repairs 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.069
 bright relatives began to recruit from 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.509
 your pocket 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.519
 proven in different areas as possible 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.089
 rather 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 is increasing 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:33.669
 getting ready
