really long time you guys haven't seen
my<00:01:27.750> skin<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.380> its<00:01:28.799> best<00:01:29.579> basically<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.290> was

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
my skin at its best basically and it was

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.190 
my skin at its best basically and it was
before<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> even<00:01:31.979> came<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.400> YouTube<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.540> my

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
before I even came on YouTube that my

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
before I even came on YouTube that my
skin<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.979> better<00:01:35.159> than<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.970> but

skin was way better than what it is but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
skin was way better than what it is but

figure<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.469> could<00:02:01.619> turn<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.070> crazy

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
figure if we could turn this crazy

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.179 
figure if we could turn this crazy
this<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.900> positive<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.590> try<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> learn

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
this to a positive and just try to learn

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.920 
this to a positive and just try to learn
from<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.729> hopefully<00:02:06.820> we<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.180> find<00:02:07.659> some

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
from it and hopefully we can find some

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.529 
from it and hopefully we can find some
stuff<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.349> know<00:02:08.470> let's<00:02:09.039> see<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.759> kind<00:02:10.479> of

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
stuff you know let's see I'm kind of

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.089 
stuff you know let's see I'm kind of
wondering<00:02:10.720> if<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:10.989> should<00:02:11.170> try<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.470> primer<00:02:11.920> I

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
wondering if I should try a primer I

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.070 
wondering if I should try a primer I
have<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.180> those<00:02:13.330> random<00:02:13.660> stuff

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
have that I just have those random stuff

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.229 
have that I just have those random stuff
that<00:02:14.110> any<00:02:14.410> when<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> realize<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> had<00:02:15.310> honest

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
that any when you realize I had honest

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.449 
that any when you realize I had honest
but<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.569> here<00:02:16.840> sheer<00:02:17.110> covers<00:02:17.500> base<00:02:17.770> Perfector

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
but I'm here sheer covers base Perfector

but I'm here sheer covers base Perfector
primer<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.060> guess<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.989> will<00:02:20.170> try<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.750> do

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
primer I guess I will try that and I do

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.199 
primer I guess I will try that and I do
like<00:02:23.410> other<00:02:23.680> shear<00:02:24.069> cover<00:02:24.340> stuff<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:24.940> I'm

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
like other shear cover stuff so I'm

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.059 
like other shear cover stuff so I'm
hoping<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.800> good<00:02:26.950> luck

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
hoping that I can have some good luck

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.190 
hoping that I can have some good luck
with<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:28.200> possibly<00:02:30.750> none<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.019> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
with this one possibly none of this is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.820 
with this one possibly none of this is
cheating<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.690> figure<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.230> want<00:02:35.410> this

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
cheating but I figure I just want this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.790 
cheating but I figure I just want this
foundation<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:37.030> at<00:02:37.209> its<00:02:37.360> best<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.260> right

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
foundation of be at its best on right

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.449 
foundation of be at its best on right
now<00:02:40.319> right<00:02:41.319> now<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:43.019> 1151<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.470> love<00:02:45.220> this

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.340 
now right now it is 1151 I love this
brush<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.900> Sedona<00:02:47.440> lace<00:02:47.590> FeO<00:02:48.540> 0-7<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.930> I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
brush it's the Sedona lace FeO 0-7 so I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.530 
brush it's the Sedona lace FeO 0-7 so I
use<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.890> foundations<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> time

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.539 

I'm<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.840> do<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.049> little<00:02:56.170> bit<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.340> also

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
I'm just gonna do a little bit and also

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.699 
I'm just gonna do a little bit and also
I<00:02:57.640> guess<00:02:57.819> since<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.180> spring<00:02:58.900> summer<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.500> has

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
I guess since it's spring summer it has

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.720 
I guess since it's spring summer it has
been<00:02:59.950> pretty<00:03:00.220> warm<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:00.970> really<00:03:01.600> um<00:03:02.730> that's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
been pretty warm I just really um that's

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.130 
been pretty warm I just really um that's
why<00:03:03.850> sometimes<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.540> see<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.780> my<00:03:04.870> videos

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
why sometimes if you see in my videos

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.539 
why sometimes if you see in my videos
you<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.410> if<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.799> can<00:03:06.010> see<00:03:06.040> imperfections

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
you like if you can see imperfections

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.150 
you like if you can see imperfections
because<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.660> sometimes<00:03:08.140> I'll<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.890> like

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
because I sometimes I'll just do like

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.830 
because I sometimes I'll just do like
concealer<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.180> try<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.359> do<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.570> powder

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
concealer and try to do it powder

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.599 
concealer and try to do it powder
because<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.859> don't<00:03:12.040> even<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.430> when

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
because I don't even like when

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.259 
because I don't even like when
foundations<00:03:13.480> right<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.380> know<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:16.180> you

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
foundations right now you know if you

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.940 
foundations right now you know if you
don't<00:03:16.570> sit<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.019> just<00:03:17.200> them<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.620> feel<00:03:17.799> like

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
don't sit for just them and I feel like

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.490 
don't sit for just them and I feel like
they<00:03:18.100> kind<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.519> change<00:03:18.850> color<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:20.140> with<00:03:20.320> one

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
they kind of change color to so with one

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.890 
they kind of change color to so with one
layer<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.769> can<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:21.250> imperfections<00:03:22.120> still<00:03:22.450> I

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
layer I can see imperfections still I

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.190 
layer I can see imperfections still I
did<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.739> pretty<00:03:24.010> thin<00:03:24.310> layer<00:03:24.489> with<00:03:24.760> my<00:03:24.989> skin<00:03:25.989> I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
did a pretty thin layer with my skin I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.870 
did a pretty thin layer with my skin I
just<00:03:26.230> feel<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.799> almost<00:03:27.100> need<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> lot<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
just feel like I almost need a lot of

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.210 
just feel like I almost need a lot of
layers<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.870> cover<00:03:29.200> everything<00:03:29.560> Matt<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.100> I

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
layers to cover everything Matt and I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.400 
layers to cover everything Matt and I
just<00:03:30.489> don't<00:03:30.670> even<00:03:30.820> like<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.239> do<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.690> right

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
just don't even like to do that right

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.610

now
feels<00:03:33.010> pretty<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:34.090> doesn't<00:03:34.390> feel<00:03:34.480> clogging

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
feels pretty it doesn't feel clogging

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.410 
feels pretty it doesn't feel clogging
which<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.560> because<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.040> don't<00:03:36.190> like<00:03:36.420> like

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
which I like because I don't like like

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.690

although although I do need full
coverage<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.269> hate<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.720> feeling<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:41.109> full

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
coverage I hate the feeling of full

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.740 
coverage I hate the feeling of full
coverage<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.150> did<00:03:43.329> get<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:43.600> in

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
coverage I think I did get this in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.789 
coverage I think I did get this in
winter<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.290> maybe<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:44.769> why<00:03:46.260> maybe<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.590> is

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
winter so maybe that's why maybe that is

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.400 
winter so maybe that's why maybe that is
why<00:03:48.750> um

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
why um

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.190

done a whole bunch of like going outside
or<00:04:05.620> anything<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.780> kind<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.230> whenever<00:04:08.590> I

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
or anything so that's kind of whenever I

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.130 
or anything so that's kind of whenever I
feel<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.310> my<00:04:09.579> makeup<00:04:09.910> starts<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.600> melt<00:04:10.870> and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
feel like my makeup starts to melt and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.700 
feel like my makeup starts to melt and
feel<00:04:11.319> nasty<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.159> know<00:04:12.190> as

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
feel nasty you know as

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.290 
feel nasty you know as
whenever<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:12.980> start<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.310> go<00:04:13.460> outside<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.180> then

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
whenever I start to go outside and then

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.900 
whenever I start to go outside and then
come<00:04:14.330> inside<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.230> walk<00:04:15.830> round<00:04:16.100> then<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.700> start

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
come inside and walk round then I start

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.270 
come inside and walk round then I start
to<00:04:17.030> like<00:04:17.180> sweat<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.510> little<00:04:17.660> bit<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.320> since<00:04:19.100> it

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
to like sweat a little bit and since it

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.430 
to like sweat a little bit and since it
is<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.430> little<00:04:19.730> bit<00:04:19.880> warmer<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.420> guess<00:04:21.020> we'll<00:04:21.230> see

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
is a little bit warmer I guess we'll see

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.200 
is a little bit warmer I guess we'll see
I'm<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.770> to<00:04:21.800> probably<00:04:22.100> come<00:04:22.460> back<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.850> here

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
I'm going to probably come back on here

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'm going to probably come back on here
maybe<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.730> maybe<00:04:25.730> like<00:04:26.030> six<00:04:26.360> hours<00:04:26.570> or

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
maybe and maybe like six hours or

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.640 
maybe and maybe like six hours or
something<00:04:27.440> like<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:30.230> will<00:04:30.380> see

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
something like that and then we will see

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.800 
something like that and then we will see
where<00:04:30.920> we're<00:04:31.130> at<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.790> really<00:04:32.060> don't<00:04:32.390> think<00:04:32.480> that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
where we're at I really don't think that

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230 
where we're at I really don't think that
it's<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.140> 25-hour<00:04:33.710> foundation<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:34.940> honest

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
it's a 25-hour foundation to be honest

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.360 
it's a 25-hour foundation to be honest
but<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.510> mean<00:04:35.780> like<00:04:36.590> when<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.040> heck<00:04:37.190> do<00:04:37.340> you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
but I mean like when the heck do you

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.060 
but I mean like when the heck do you
need<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.730> wear<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.120> for<00:04:38.180> 25<00:04:38.750> hours<00:04:39.110> that's<00:04:39.860> my

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
need to wear this for 25 hours that's my

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.630 
need to wear this for 25 hours that's my
question<00:04:40.310> um<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:42.500> yeah<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.710> mean<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.610> a

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
question um but yeah I mean it is a

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.610 
question um but yeah I mean it is a
little<00:04:44.120> bit<00:04:44.270> lighter<00:04:44.540> but<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:44.930> think<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.320> made<00:04:45.500> it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
little bit lighter but I think I made it

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.500 
little bit lighter but I think I made it
work<00:04:45.770> okay<00:04:46.190> but<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.700> probably<00:04:47.000> should<00:04:47.330> go<00:04:47.480> a

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
work okay but I probably should go a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.290 
work okay but I probably should go a
shade<00:04:47.930> or<00:04:48.800> two<00:04:48.830> darker<00:04:49.130> okay<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.090> now<00:04:50.570> oh<00:04:52.300> he's

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
shade or two darker okay so now oh he's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.830 
shade or two darker okay so now oh he's
not<00:04:53.680> 7:13<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.070> I<00:04:55.490> figured<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.180> was<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.480> good

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
not 7:13 and I figured that was a good

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.780 
not 7:13 and I figured that was a good
amount<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.170> time<00:04:57.410> plus<00:04:57.890> I<00:04:58.130> really<00:04:58.310> just<00:04:58.580> want

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
amount of time plus I really just want

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.670 
amount of time plus I really just want
to<00:04:58.820> take<00:04:59.030> off<00:04:59.210> my<00:04:59.240> makeup<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.930> isn't<00:05:00.230> too<00:05:00.440> bad

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
to take off my makeup it isn't too bad

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.210 
to take off my makeup it isn't too bad
it<00:05:00.920> doesn't<00:05:01.010> feel<00:05:01.400> too<00:05:02.140> like<00:05:03.140> one<00:05:03.890> take<00:05:04.070> off

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
it doesn't feel too like one take off

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.540 
it doesn't feel too like one take off
but<00:05:04.520> then<00:05:04.970> again<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.540> mean<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.440> wasn't<00:05:06.800> running

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
but then again I mean I wasn't running

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.460 
but then again I mean I wasn't running
around<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:08.000> much<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.510> I'm<00:05:08.720> wondering<00:05:09.230> if

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
around that much like I'm wondering if

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.080 
around that much like I'm wondering if
it'd<00:05:09.560> be<00:05:09.680> different<00:05:09.950> if<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.430> was<00:05:10.580> kind<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:10.820> doing

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
it'd be different if I was kind of doing

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.330 
it'd be different if I was kind of doing
errands<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.690> stuff<00:05:11.750> today<00:05:12.140> but<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.920> am<00:05:13.010> filming

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
errands and stuff today but I am filming

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.520 
errands and stuff today but I am filming

this on a Saturday so as you can see I'm

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.680 
this on a Saturday so as you can see I'm
a<00:05:15.560> little<00:05:15.710> bit<00:05:16.100> shiny<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.580> didn't<00:05:17.060> blow<00:05:17.300> at<00:05:17.480> all

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
a little bit shiny I didn't blow at all

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.100 
a little bit shiny I didn't blow at all
ever<00:05:18.530> since<00:05:19.100> I<00:05:19.310> first<00:05:19.550> did<00:05:19.820> my<00:05:20.000> makeup<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.780> um

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
ever since I first did my makeup this um

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
it at all and now I'm kind of changing

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.900 
it at all and now I'm kind of changing
my<00:05:43.730> mind<00:05:44.030> thinking<00:05:44.600> it<00:05:45.530> isn't<00:05:46.040> so<00:05:46.220> bad<00:05:46.460> it's

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
my mind thinking it isn't so bad it's

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.320 
my mind thinking it isn't so bad it's
actually<00:05:47.150> not<00:05:47.690> too<00:05:48.320> bad<00:05:48.730> like<00:05:49.730> I<00:05:49.970> don't<00:05:50.090> know

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
actually not too bad like I don't know

actually not too bad like I don't know
the<00:05:50.540> only<00:05:50.690> thing<00:05:50.780> is<00:05:51.080> I<00:05:51.230> think<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:51.800> might<00:05:52.070> want

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
the only thing is I think I might want

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.540 
the only thing is I think I might want
to<00:05:52.610> toss<00:05:52.850> it<00:05:53.240> just<00:05:53.540> because<00:05:54.110> I<00:05:54.530> do<00:05:54.830> think<00:05:55.430> I

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
to toss it just because I do think I

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.460 
to toss it just because I do think I
need<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.910> darker<00:05:56.330> color<00:05:56.540> or<00:05:56.990> maybe<00:05:57.230> I<00:05:57.350> should

keep<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:57.950> I<00:05:58.190> don't<00:05:58.400> know<00:05:58.490> but<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.360> do<00:05:59.450> think<00:05:59.690> I

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
keep it I don't know but I do think I

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.660 
keep it I don't know but I do think I
need<00:05:59.990> like<00:06:00.020> about<00:06:00.350> two<00:06:00.560> shades<00:06:00.590> darker<00:06:01.280> you
