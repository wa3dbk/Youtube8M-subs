00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
about you may want to consider what is

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.560

called<00:04:44.370> self<00:04:45.180> striping<00:04:45.900> yarn<00:04:46.910> these<00:04:47.910> stripes

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
called self striping yarn these stripes

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.500 
called self striping yarn these stripes
happen<00:04:49.290> because<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.400> way<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.030> yarn<00:04:51.300> has

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
happen because of the way the yarn has

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.590 
happen because of the way the yarn has
died<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.530> every<00:04:52.980> equal<00:04:53.520> spaces<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.360> color

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
died and so every equal spaces the color

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.930 
died and so every equal spaces the color
changes<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.290> you<00:04:55.440> end<00:04:55.620> up<00:04:55.710> with<00:04:55.770> stripes<00:04:56.370> even

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
changes and you end up with stripes even

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.270 
changes and you end up with stripes even
