can I give you the rundown on this first
thing<00:00:18.550> you<00:00:18.669> notice<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.060> gold<00:00:19.300> anodized

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
thing you notice the gold anodized

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.409 
thing you notice the gold anodized
aluminium<00:00:20.320> base<00:00:20.980> here<00:00:21.310> which<00:00:21.489> is<00:00:21.700> a<00:00:21.730> really

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
aluminium base here which is a really

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.269 
aluminium base here which is a really
nice<00:00:22.599> got<00:00:22.840> a<00:00:22.869> really<00:00:23.020> nice<00:00:23.200> finish<00:00:23.619> cnc

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
nice got a really nice finish cnc

nice got a really nice finish cnc
machined<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:25.149> gold<00:00:25.779> anodized<00:00:26.200> there<00:00:26.470> in<00:00:26.559> the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
machined and gold anodized there in the

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.880 
machined and gold anodized there in the
rotor<00:00:26.770> star<00:00:27.040> colors<00:00:27.599> very<00:00:28.599> cool<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.079> it<00:00:29.710> has<00:00:29.860> a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
rotor star colors very cool and it has a

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.130 
rotor star colors very cool and it has a
carbon-fiber<00:00:30.610> frame<00:00:31.329> you'll<00:00:31.660> see<00:00:31.689> here<00:00:31.989> so

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
carbon-fiber frame you'll see here so

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.900 
carbon-fiber frame you'll see here so
the<00:00:32.259> actual<00:00:32.500> side<00:00:32.770> plates<00:00:33.130> are<00:00:33.340> made<00:00:33.460> from<00:00:33.730> a

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
the actual side plates are made from a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.000 
the actual side plates are made from a
real<00:00:34.360> carbon<00:00:34.720> fiber<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.200> then<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:35.770> has<00:00:35.890> some

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
real carbon fiber and then it has some

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.910 
real carbon fiber and then it has some
little<00:00:36.100> alloy<00:00:36.960> legs<00:00:37.960> or<00:00:38.200> connecting<00:00:38.680> tubes

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
little alloy legs or connecting tubes

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520 
little alloy legs or connecting tubes
basically<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.460> hold<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.090> frame<00:00:40.270> together

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
basically that hold the frame together

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.960 
basically that hold the frame together
you<00:00:41.530> then<00:00:41.710> have<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.920> steel<00:00:42.190> shaft<00:00:42.520> here<00:00:42.820> which

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
you then have a steel shaft here which

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.970 
you then have a steel shaft here which
is<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.240> pivot<00:00:43.450> point<00:00:43.840> for<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.290> balancing

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
is the pivot point for the balancing

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.490 
is the pivot point for the balancing
base<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:46.120> balancing<00:00:46.480> base<00:00:46.660> itself<00:00:47.079> has

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
base and the balancing base itself has

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.560 
base and the balancing base itself has
ball<00:00:48.040> bearings<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:48.670> which<00:00:48.820> give<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.120> super

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
ball bearings here which give it a super

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.220 
ball bearings here which give it a super
smooth<00:00:49.930> action<00:00:50.260> on<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.950> that<00:00:51.579> Center<00:00:51.910> shaft

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
smooth action on that that Center shaft

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.290 
smooth action on that that Center shaft
so<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.650> idea<00:00:54.100> behind<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:54.670> many<00:00:55.090> of<00:00:55.150> you<00:00:55.239> are

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
so the idea behind this many of you are

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.430 
so the idea behind this many of you are
probably<00:00:55.390> familiar<00:00:55.690> with<00:00:55.870> already<00:00:56.200> this<00:00:56.380> is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
probably familiar with already this is

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.080 
probably familiar with already this is
just<00:00:56.739> for<00:00:56.890> balancing<00:00:57.370> your<00:00:57.460> blades<00:00:57.700> it<00:00:57.880> can<00:00:58.000> be

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
just for balancing your blades it can be

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.900 
just for balancing your blades it can be
used<00:00:58.300> for<00:00:58.510> tail<00:00:58.780> blades<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.380> main<00:00:59.800> blades<00:01:00.100> and

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
used for tail blades and main blades and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.180 
used for tail blades and main blades and
it'll<00:01:01.480> do<00:01:01.660> just<00:01:01.899> about<00:01:02.020> any<00:01:02.320> different<00:01:02.980> size

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
it'll do just about any different size

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.429 
it'll do just about any different size
of<00:01:03.399> blade<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.540> holes<00:01:04.839> here<00:01:05.079> on<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.290> base

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
of blade so the holes here on the base

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.410 
of blade so the holes here on the base
you've<00:01:05.680> got<00:01:05.710> two<00:01:06.490> three<00:01:06.880> four<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.390> five

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
you've got two three four and five

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.540 
you've got two three four and five
millimeters<00:01:08.050> that'll<00:01:08.320> cover<00:01:08.470> anything<00:01:09.190> from

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
millimeters that'll cover anything from

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.250 
millimeters that'll cover anything from
your<00:01:09.880> really<00:01:10.090> small<00:01:10.420> tail<00:01:10.690> blades<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.140> like

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
your really small tail blades for like

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.920 
your really small tail blades for like
450<00:01:11.770> sized<00:01:11.950> helis<00:01:12.310> all<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.060> way<00:01:13.150> up<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.450> large

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
450 sized helis all the way up to large

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.590 
450 sized helis all the way up to large
size<00:01:14.290> main<00:01:14.590> blades<00:01:14.920> for<00:01:15.190> up<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.520> say<00:01:15.729> 700<00:01:16.420> class

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
size main blades for up to say 700 class

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.230 
size main blades for up to say 700 class
helis<00:01:17.049> so<00:01:17.979> very<00:01:18.340> convenience<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.909> best<00:01:19.120> way

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
helis so very convenience the best way

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.030 
helis so very convenience the best way
to<00:01:19.270> balance<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.750> blades<00:01:19.990> because<00:01:20.560> it's<00:01:20.890> just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
to balance the blades because it's just

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.039 
to balance the blades because it's just
really<00:01:21.250> simple<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.880> don't<00:01:22.030> need<00:01:22.150> any<00:01:22.299> special

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
really simple you don't need any special

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.170 
really simple you don't need any special
tools<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:24.370> know<00:01:24.460> other<00:01:24.610> than<00:01:24.820> this<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.000> know

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
tools you know other than this you know

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240 
tools you know other than this you know
you<00:01:25.299> see<00:01:25.479> some<00:01:26.020> different<00:01:26.350> balancing

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
you see some different balancing

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.120 
you see some different balancing
techniques<00:01:27.580> where<00:01:27.700> people<00:01:27.970> use<00:01:28.120> like<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:29.290> rod

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
techniques where people use like a rod

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.190 
techniques where people use like a rod
or<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.430> pin<00:01:31.119> something<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.960> put<00:01:32.140> the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
or a pin something like that to put the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.810 
or a pin something like that to put the
blades<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.650> it's<00:01:32.830> really<00:01:33.010> finicky<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.430> just<00:01:33.700> a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
blades on it's really finicky and just a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.120 
blades on it's really finicky and just a
bit<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.540> pain<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.869> do<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.470> this<00:01:35.799> simplifies

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
bit of a pain to do so this simplifies

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.280 
bit of a pain to do so this simplifies
things<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:37.030> at<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.330> very<00:01:37.360> low<00:01:37.659> cost<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.260> a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
things and at a very low cost so a

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.200 
things and at a very low cost so a
really<00:01:38.950> simple<00:01:39.250> great<00:01:39.430> tool<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.670> have<00:01:39.909> in<00:01:40.180> your

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
really simple great tool to have in your

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.960 
really simple great tool to have in your
heli<00:01:40.690> kit<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.710> I've<00:01:42.310> got<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> couple<00:01:42.700> blades

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
heli kit so I've got a couple blades

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.340 
heli kit so I've got a couple blades
here<00:01:43.240> just<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.510> show<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.720> how<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.110> works

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
here just to show you how this works

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.950 
here just to show you how this works
we've<00:01:44.619> got<00:01:44.799> some<00:01:45.010> tail<00:01:45.400> blades<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.960> these

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
we've got some tail blades and these

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.460 
we've got some tail blades and these
utilize<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.950> three<00:01:48.400> millimeter<00:01:49.260> bolts<00:01:50.260> so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
utilize the three millimeter bolts so

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.230 
utilize the three millimeter bolts so
we're<00:01:50.950> gonna<00:01:51.100> use<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.430> three<00:01:51.670> millimeter

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
we're gonna use the three millimeter

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.090 
we're gonna use the three millimeter
bolt<00:01:52.659> which<00:01:52.810> comes<00:01:53.020> included<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.920> that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
bolt which comes included and that's

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.260 
bolt which comes included and that's
also<00:01:54.280> something<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.700> mention<00:01:54.820> this<00:01:55.030> comes

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
also something to mention this comes

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.179 
also something to mention this comes
with<00:01:55.450> all<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.750> hardware<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.650> package<00:01:57.010> so

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
with all the hardware in the package so

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.760 
with all the hardware in the package so
you've<00:01:57.310> got<00:01:57.460> your<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:58.060> pair<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:59.229> two<00:01:59.409> three

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770

four<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.549> five<00:02:00.580> millimeter<00:02:01.060> bolts<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
four and five millimeter bolts for the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.870 
four and five millimeter bolts for the
different<00:02:01.960> blades<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.220> we'll<00:02:03.369> put<00:02:03.520> these<00:02:03.640> on

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
different blades so we'll put these on

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.420 
different blades so we'll put these on
get<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:05.159> mounted<00:02:06.159> here

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
right there on the top of the the base

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800 
right there on the top of the the base
and<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.159> this<00:02:21.489> is<00:02:21.670> very<00:02:22.060> accurate<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.599> works

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and now this is very accurate and works

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
spirit level which will show you when

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.030 
spirit level which will show you when
these<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.409> put<00:02:27.340> out<00:02:27.370> here<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:28.510> will<00:02:28.599> show<00:02:28.840> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
these are put out here it will show you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.259 
these are put out here it will show you
whether<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.220> balanced<00:02:30.549> or<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:31.150> in

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
whether you're balanced or not now in

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.119 
whether you're balanced or not now in
this<00:02:31.390> case<00:02:31.629> these<00:02:32.019> blades<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.500> slightly

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
this case these blades are just slightly

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.649 
this case these blades are just slightly
slightly<00:02:33.549> slightly<00:02:33.730> out<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.120> balance<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.569> what

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
slightly slightly out of balance so what

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.600 
slightly slightly out of balance so what
we'd<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.079> do<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:35.530> case<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
we'd have to do in this case is on the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.430 
we'd have to do in this case is on the
tail<00:02:37.209> blade<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.720> side<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.349> one

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
tail blade on this side you see the one

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.110 
tail blade on this side you see the one
that's<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> bit<00:02:38.769> high<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.579> would<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.940> add<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that's a bit high we would just add a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.520 
that's a bit high we would just add a
little<00:02:40.269> bit<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.569> tape<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.959> little<00:02:41.110> bit<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.349> clear

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
little bit of tape a little bit of clear

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.589 
little bit of tape a little bit of clear
tape<00:02:41.739> works<00:02:42.010> fine<00:02:42.220> some<00:02:43.090> guys<00:02:43.239> are<00:02:43.420> doing

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
tape works fine some guys are doing

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.699 
tape works fine some guys are doing
different<00:02:43.900> ways<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.230> know<00:02:44.319> gonna<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.560> some

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
different ways you know gonna do some

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.259 
different ways you know gonna do some
sanding<00:02:44.950> or<00:02:45.310> something<00:02:45.579> like<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
sanding or something like that on the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.660 
sanding or something like that on the
heavier<00:02:46.959> blade<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.010> easiest<00:02:48.310> way<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
heavier blade but the easiest way the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.910 
heavier blade but the easiest way the
way<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.780> lot<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.079> us<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.349> is<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.650> simply

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
way that a lot of us do is just simply

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.099 
way that a lot of us do is just simply
use<00:02:51.040> some<00:02:51.190> clear<00:02:51.400> tape<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.150> lighter<00:02:52.870> blade

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
use some clear tape on the lighter blade

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.500 
use some clear tape on the lighter blade
just<00:02:53.379> waiting<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.799> up<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.390> that'll<00:02:55.390> get

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
just waiting it up a bit and that'll get

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.729 
just waiting it up a bit and that'll get
it<00:02:55.599> balanced<00:02:55.959> out<00:02:56.019> perfectly<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.650> then

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
it balanced out perfectly and then

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.970 
it balanced out perfectly and then
you're<00:02:56.859> ready<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.099> go<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.430> super<00:02:58.359> easy<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.780> use
