individual segment segment or even
forming<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> cars<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
forming because a lot of the cars are

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
forming because a lot of the cars are
stand<00:01:47.670> alone<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.090> their<00:01:48.240> segments<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
stand alone in their segments but

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160 
stand alone in their segments but
clearly<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> wide<00:01:51.240> range<00:01:51.479> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
clearly there's really a wide range so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
clearly there's really a wide range so
you<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.560> small<00:01:53.250> cars<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> alto

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you got like small cars from the alto

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.660 
you got like small cars from the alto
k10<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.439> although<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> way<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
k10 you know although all the way up to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
k10 you know although all the way up to
the<00:01:56.820> Jaguar<00:01:57.210> f-type<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.170> see

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the Jaguar f-type so you can really see

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.980 
the Jaguar f-type so you can really see
that<00:01:58.710> there's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> wide<00:01:59.579> spectrum<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.509> cars<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that there's a wide spectrum of cars and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
that there's a wide spectrum of cars and
that's<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.320> reflective<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> car

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that's really reflective of the car

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
that's really reflective of the car
market<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.689> manufacturer<00:02:04.619> filling<00:02:04.950> all

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
market because manufacturer filling all

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
market because manufacturer filling all
the<00:02:05.640> niches<00:02:05.939> possible<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.799> offering<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:07.950> many

the niches possible and offering as many

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979 
the niches possible and offering as many
models<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.670> possible<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:09.959> expect

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
models as possible to when can we expect

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.360 
models as possible to when can we expect
the<00:02:10.379> results<00:02:10.530> jan<00:02:11.340> 9th

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the results jan 9th

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.880 
the results jan 9th
that's<00:02:12.459> when<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.989> AutoCAD<00:02:14.500> awards

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
that's when we have the AutoCAD awards

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.830 
that's when we have the AutoCAD awards
at<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.129> Taj<00:02:15.430> Lands<00:02:15.730> End<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.269> that's<00:02:16.690> a

at the Taj Lands End so I think that's a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.030 
at the Taj Lands End so I think that's a
day<00:02:16.959> everyone's<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.739> who<00:02:18.010> the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
lenses we felt you know we have to do a

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.199 
lenses we felt you know we have to do a
bit<00:03:04.629> for<00:03:04.840> make<00:03:05.019> in<00:03:05.170> India<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.739> mean<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
bit for make in India I mean I think it

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.059 
bit for make in India I mean I think it
is<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.019> bold<00:03:08.409> step<00:03:08.970> by<00:03:09.970> delivery

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
is a it is a bold step by delivery

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.589 
is a it is a bold step by delivery
clearly<00:03:12.069> it's<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.879> easy<00:03:13.060> I

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
clearly it's not going to be easy I

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.830 
clearly it's not going to be easy I
think<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.739> car<00:03:14.980> looks<00:03:15.640> good<00:03:15.909> obviously<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> lot

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
polarizable yeah yeah so some people

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.039 
polarizable yeah yeah so some people
don't<00:03:21.849> like<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.030> from<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.359> rear<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.840> think

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
don't like it from the rear but I think

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.390 
don't like it from the rear but I think
overall<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.530> striking<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.220> what<00:03:24.310> you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
overall it is striking and what you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.150 
overall it is striking and what you
can't<00:03:24.730> deny<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.049> makes<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.560> certain

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
can't deny that it makes a certain

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.949 
can't deny that it makes a certain
impact<00:03:27.669> when<00:03:27.849> you<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.239> pass<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.720> saw

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
impact when you see it pass and we saw

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.420 
impact when you see it pass and we saw
that<00:03:29.109> when<00:03:29.260> we<00:03:29.379> were<00:03:29.470> testing<00:03:29.620> in<00:03:29.889> an<00:03:30.010> ambien

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that when we were testing in an ambien

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.879 
that when we were testing in an ambien
so<00:03:30.669> clearly<00:03:31.180> i<00:03:31.269> think<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.989> looks<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.410> going<00:03:32.799> to

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
so clearly i think the looks is going to

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.740 
so clearly i think the looks is going to
be<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> strong<00:03:33.250> point<00:03:33.489> for<00:03:33.669> most<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.419> people

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
be a strong point for most of the people

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.690 
be a strong point for most of the people
who<00:03:34.870> bought<00:03:35.049> obviously<00:03:35.859> purists<00:03:36.310> will<00:03:36.430> have

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
who bought obviously purists will have

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.089 
who bought obviously purists will have
some<00:03:37.269> issues<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> styling<00:03:38.379> which<00:03:38.680> they

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
some issues on the styling which they

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.250 
some issues on the styling which they
might<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.579> wanted<00:03:39.760> cleaner<00:03:40.150> lines<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:40.780> if

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
might have wanted cleaner lines but if

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.930 
might have wanted cleaner lines but if
you<00:03:41.470> look<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.799> price<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.639> look<00:03:42.819> at

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
you look at the price and you look at

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.189 
you look at the price and you look at
the<00:03:43.030> looks<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.419> look<00:03:43.569> at<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.810> speck<00:03:43.930> I

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
the looks and you look at the speck I

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.360 
the looks and you look at the speck I
think<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.590> know<00:03:44.709> you're<00:03:44.889> getting<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.220> lot<00:03:45.310> of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
think you know you're getting a lot of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.979 
think you know you're getting a lot of
bang<00:03:45.609> for<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.970> buck<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.359> think<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.750> key

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
bang for the buck I think the key

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.629 
bang for the buck I think the key
challenge<00:03:47.440> will<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.829> last<00:03:48.010> ten<00:03:48.250> percent

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
challenge will be the last ten percent

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.949 
challenge will be the last ten percent
there's<00:03:48.849> still<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> lot<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.269> work<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.690> be<00:03:49.720> done

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959

there's still a lot of work to be done
your<00:03:50.530> assignment<00:03:50.949> to<00:03:51.310> be<00:03:51.430> done<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:51.760> think<00:03:52.239> if<00:03:52.590> DC

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
your assignment to be done I think if DC

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.559 
your assignment to be done I think if DC
gets<00:03:53.949> that<00:03:54.099> right<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.150> really

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
gets that right you know this really

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.349 
gets that right you know this really

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
to give our readers an idea of what it

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.540 
to give our readers an idea of what it
is<00:04:22.479> obviously<00:04:23.319> the<00:04:23.439> wire<00:04:23.590> either<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.069> big

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
is obviously the wire either the big

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.339 
is obviously the wire either the big
hatchback<00:04:25.449> is<00:04:25.689> going<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.020> be<00:04:26.110> an<00:04:26.199> i-20

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
hatchback is going to be an i-20

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.589 
hatchback is going to be an i-20
competitor<00:04:27.250> one<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.610> see<00:04:27.789> it's<00:04:27.939> got<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.419> lot<00:04:28.539> of

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
competitor one can see it's got a lot of

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.260 
competitor one can see it's got a lot of
space<00:04:28.960> inside<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.680> unlike<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.639> Swift<00:04:31.060> which

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
space inside and unlike the Swift which

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.360 
space inside and unlike the Swift which
is<00:04:31.389> a<00:04:31.419> distinct<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.199> box<00:04:32.439> design<00:04:32.889> this<00:04:33.159> is<00:04:33.219> a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
is a distinct to box design this is a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.689 
is a distinct to box design this is a
more<00:04:33.669> kind<00:04:33.879> of<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.210> mono<00:04:34.990> space<00:04:35.830> more<00:04:36.430> cab

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
more kind of a mono space more cab

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.459 
more kind of a mono space more cab
forward<00:04:37.000> design<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:37.599> really<00:04:37.900> points<00:04:38.319> had<00:04:38.439> a

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
forward design so really points had a

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.200 
forward design so really points had a
lot<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.680> interior<00:04:39.280> space<00:04:39.340> inside<00:04:39.939> so<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.150> think

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
lot of interior space inside so I think

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.149 
lot of interior space inside so I think
this<00:04:40.479> car<00:04:40.689> is<00:04:40.719> going<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.960> be<00:04:41.139> majoring<00:04:41.949> on

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
this car is going to be majoring on

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.830 
this car is going to be majoring on
interior<00:04:42.430> space<00:04:42.819> to<00:04:42.969> take<00:04:43.120> on<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.389> i-20

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
interior space to take on the i-20

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.230 
interior space to take on the i-20
coming<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.409> y<00:04:44.590> ba<00:04:44.830> yeah<00:04:45.370> which<00:04:45.789> is<00:04:45.819> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
coming to the y ba yeah which is the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.749 
coming to the y ba yeah which is the
EcoSport<00:04:47.110> rival<00:04:47.469> that<00:04:48.039> again<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.430> looks<00:04:48.460> like

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
EcoSport rival that again it looks like

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.600 
EcoSport rival that again it looks like
a<00:04:48.789> mini<00:04:49.060> vitara<00:04:49.479> styling<00:04:50.469> is<00:04:50.620> better<00:04:51.340> than

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
a mini vitara styling is better than

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.670 
a mini vitara styling is better than
most<00:04:51.879> maruti<00:04:52.690> zar<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:52.960> think<00:04:53.289> it's<00:04:53.409> got<00:04:53.650> a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
most maruti zar I think it's got a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.350 
most maruti zar I think it's got a
little<00:04:53.860> bit<00:04:54.099> of<00:04:54.129> road<00:04:54.370> presence<00:04:54.789> so<00:04:54.969> pretty

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
little bit of road presence so pretty

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.930 
little bit of road presence so pretty
angular<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.190> straight<00:04:57.190> forward<00:04:57.219> which<00:04:57.789> is

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
angular and straight forward which is

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.089 
angular and straight forward which is
like<00:04:58.090> more<00:04:58.330> Suzuki's<00:04:58.870> but<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.289> think<00:04:59.830> again

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
like more Suzuki's but I think again

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.890 
like more Suzuki's but I think again
this<00:05:00.129> is<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.400> lot<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.729> potential<00:05:01.300> because<00:05:01.780> from

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
this is a lot of potential because from

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.689 
this is a lot of potential because from
what<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.229> hear<00:05:02.409> is<00:05:02.620> going<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.889> have<00:05:02.979> a<00:05:03.039> 1.5

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
what we hear is going to have a 1.5

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.610 
what we hear is going to have a 1.5
diesel<00:05:04.060> engine<00:05:04.389> so<00:05:04.569> it<00:05:04.719> will<00:05:04.810> have<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.990> good

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
diesel engine so it will have a good

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.469 
diesel engine so it will have a good
amount<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:06.009> pep<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.150> going<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.360> be<00:05:07.449> very

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
amount of pep and it's going to be very

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.659 
amount of pep and it's going to be very
competitively<00:05:08.229> priced<00:05:08.500> plus<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.069> compact

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
competitively priced plus the compact

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.149 
competitively priced plus the compact
SUV<00:05:10.030> segment<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.569> really<00:05:10.990> Bob<00:05:11.169> yeah<00:05:11.349> i<00:05:11.650> think

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
SUV segment is really Bob yeah i think

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.909 
SUV segment is really Bob yeah i think
when<00:05:12.460> when<00:05:12.639> they<00:05:12.759> expect<00:05:13.150> these<00:05:13.300> i<00:05:13.539> think<00:05:14.199> the

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
when when they expect these i think the

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.999 
when when they expect these i think the
time<00:05:15.099> frame<00:05:15.279> really<00:05:15.639> is<00:05:15.729> 2015<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:16.659> 2016<00:05:17.500> won't

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
time frame really is 2015 to 2016 won't

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.830 
time frame really is 2015 to 2016 won't
it<00:05:18.129> be<00:05:18.219> too<00:05:18.250> late<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:18.610> maruti<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.419> be<00:05:19.539> coming

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
it be too late for maruti to be coming

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.290 
it be too late for maruti to be coming
into<00:05:19.990> i<00:05:20.409> think<00:05:20.800> it's<00:05:20.919> never<00:05:21.039> late<00:05:21.279> you<00:05:22.150> know

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
into i think it's never late you know

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.749 
into i think it's never late you know
you<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.050> keep<00:05:23.439> coming<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:23.949> that's<00:05:24.159> a<00:05:24.340> product

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
you just keep coming in that's a product

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.209 
you just keep coming in that's a product
cycle<00:05:25.120> plan<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.509> like<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:25.870> so<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.110> mean<00:05:26.379> so<00:05:26.949> I

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
cycle plan is like that so I mean so I

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.339 
cycle plan is like that so I mean so I
think<00:05:27.279> you<00:05:28.000> know<00:05:28.029> it's<00:05:28.509> you've<00:05:28.900> just<00:05:29.110> got<00:05:29.259> to

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
think you know it's you've just got to

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.990 
think you know it's you've just got to
come<00:05:29.500> when<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.860> when<00:05:30.219> you<00:05:30.250> develop<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.849> so

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
come when you when you develop it so

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.719 
come when you when you develop it so
it's<00:05:31.120> better<00:05:31.330> late<00:05:31.990> than<00:05:32.229> never<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:33.520> this

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
it's better late than never in this

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.879 
it's better late than never in this
business<00:05:33.969> so<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.389> think<00:05:34.659> it's<00:05:35.409> good<00:05:35.529> for<00:05:35.589> maruti

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
business so I think it's good for maruti

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.260 
business so I think it's good for maruti

about car safety there was it was quite
an<00:05:41.500> issue<00:05:41.650> around<00:05:42.009> three<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.550> four<00:05:42.729> weeks<00:05:42.759> back

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
an issue around three to four weeks back

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.329 
an issue around three to four weeks back
and<00:05:43.449> we've<00:05:44.020> had<00:05:44.169> that<00:05:44.379> much<00:05:44.560> time<00:05:44.740> with<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:45.099> so

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
and we've had that much time with it so

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.730 
and we've had that much time with it so
how<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:45.789> companies<00:05:46.389> whose<00:05:46.839> kasbah<00:05:47.319> mentioned

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
how the companies whose kasbah mentioned

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.619 
how the companies whose kasbah mentioned
in<00:05:47.830> those<00:05:48.009> reports<00:05:48.520> how<00:05:48.849> they<00:05:49.120> are<00:05:49.240> open<00:05:49.509> with

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
in those reports how they are open with

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.119 
in those reports how they are open with
it<00:05:49.750> well<00:05:49.930> we've<00:05:50.080> done<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.229> big<00:05:50.469> feature<00:05:50.680> on<00:05:50.979> it

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
it well we've done a big feature on it

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.369 
it well we've done a big feature on it
in<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.400> issue<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.940> clearly<00:05:52.389> i<00:05:52.719> think<00:05:53.229> the

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
in this issue and clearly i think the

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.110 
in this issue and clearly i think the
bottom<00:05:53.680> line<00:05:53.710> is<00:05:54.039> most<00:05:54.279> indian<00:05:54.639> cars<00:05:54.879> are

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
bottom line is most indian cars are

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.079 
bottom line is most indian cars are
unsafe<00:05:55.779> as<00:05:56.020> has<00:05:56.560> been<00:05:56.800> really<00:05:57.339> highlighted<00:05:57.909> by

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
unsafe as has been really highlighted by

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.990 
unsafe as has been really highlighted by
the<00:05:58.120> end<00:05:59.020> cap<00:05:59.259> studies<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.830> I<00:05:59.889> think<00:06:00.099> you<00:06:00.879> know

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
the end cap studies and I think you know

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.999 
the end cap studies and I think you know
they've<00:06:01.150> singled<00:06:01.509> out<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.659> go<00:06:01.990> yes<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.889> is

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
they've singled out the go yes it is

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.980 
they've singled out the go yes it is
unsafe<00:06:03.370> you<00:06:03.639> know<00:06:03.849> that<00:06:04.029> it's<00:06:04.240> got<00:06:04.389> zero<00:06:04.659> stars

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
unsafe you know that it's got zero stars

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.450 
unsafe you know that it's got zero stars
but<00:06:05.139> i<00:06:05.199> think<00:06:05.409> has<00:06:05.529> been<00:06:05.680> unfairly<00:06:05.830> singled

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
but i think has been unfairly singled

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.709 
but i think has been unfairly singled
out<00:06:06.610> because<00:06:06.789> there<00:06:07.060> are<00:06:07.120> other<00:06:07.210> cars<00:06:07.509> also

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
out because there are other cars also

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.499 
out because there are other cars also
which<00:06:08.020> don't<00:06:08.740> meet<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.729> crash<00:06:09.969> requirement

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
which don't meet the crash requirement

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.869 
which don't meet the crash requirement
on<00:06:10.569> the<00:06:10.719> argument<00:06:11.199> is<00:06:11.349> that<00:06:11.379> it's<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.879> modern

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
on the argument is that it's a modern

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.240 
on the argument is that it's a modern
car<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.419> it<00:06:13.509> should<00:06:13.750> have<00:06:13.870> met<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.529> crash

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
car so it should have met the crash

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.529 
car so it should have met the crash
requirements<00:06:15.849> for<00:06:15.969> the<00:06:16.060> others<00:06:16.300> are<00:06:16.389> much

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
requirements for the others are much

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.439 
requirements for the others are much
older<00:06:16.690> cars<00:06:17.110> but<00:06:17.319> you<00:06:17.440> know<00:06:17.529> in<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.889> end

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
older cars but you know in the end

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.760 
older cars but you know in the end
crashes<00:06:19.449> are<00:06:19.599> crashing<00:06:20.050> you<00:06:20.139> know<00:06:20.259> you're<00:06:20.650> not

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
crashes are crashing you know you're not

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.129 
crashes are crashing you know you're not
going<00:06:20.949> to<00:06:21.039> be<00:06:21.190> saved<00:06:21.849> just<00:06:22.539> because<00:06:22.810> your<00:06:22.930> car

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
going to be saved just because your car

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.070 
going to be saved just because your car
is<00:06:23.319> you<00:06:24.039> know<00:06:24.159> if<00:06:24.729> the<00:06:24.879> engine<00:06:25.360> then<00:06:25.569> that<00:06:25.750> then

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
is you know if the engine then that then

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.779 
is you know if the engine then that then
they<00:06:26.259> go<00:06:26.379> so<00:06:26.620> i<00:06:26.650> think<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:27.219> NGO<00:06:27.370> has<00:06:27.550> been

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
they go so i think the NGO has been

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.999 
they go so i think the NGO has been
singled<00:06:28.180> out<00:06:28.270> rather<00:06:28.539> unfairly<00:06:29.080> I<00:06:29.469> don't<00:06:29.949> know

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
singled out rather unfairly I don't know

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.040 
singled out rather unfairly I don't know
if<00:06:30.069> there's<00:06:30.219> an<00:06:30.310> agenda<00:06:30.430> over<00:06:31.000> there<00:06:31.180> what<00:06:31.479> but

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
if there's an agenda over there what but

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.260 
if there's an agenda over there what but
I<00:06:32.259> think<00:06:32.349> the<00:06:32.529> bottom<00:06:32.860> line<00:06:32.889> is<00:06:33.039> these<00:06:33.729> studies

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
I think the bottom line is these studies

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.689 
I think the bottom line is these studies
are<00:06:34.300> good<00:06:34.659> because<00:06:34.839> it<00:06:35.139> does<00:06:35.349> highlight<00:06:35.699> the

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
are good because it does highlight the

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.550 
are good because it does highlight the
safety<00:06:37.149> or<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.360> lack<00:06:37.539> of<00:06:37.569> safety<00:06:37.959> and<00:06:38.229> it<00:06:38.349> puts

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
safety or the lack of safety and it puts

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.079 
safety or the lack of safety and it puts
a<00:06:38.709> lot<00:06:38.919> of<00:06:38.949> pressure<00:06:39.310> on<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.909> car

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:40.089 
a lot of pressure on the car

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.850 
a lot of pressure on the car
manufacturer<00:06:40.599> you<00:06:40.899> really<00:06:41.139> up<00:06:41.259> their<00:06:41.469> game<00:06:41.620> I

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
feel sorry for the car manufacturers

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.180 
feel sorry for the car manufacturers
because<00:06:43.930> really<00:06:44.349> have<00:06:44.469> to<00:06:44.589> walk<00:06:44.770> a<00:06:44.800> fine<00:06:45.159> line

because really have to walk a fine line

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.430 
because really have to walk a fine line
because<00:06:45.610> in<00:06:45.909> the<00:06:46.029> absence<00:06:46.149> of<00:06:46.509> regulation<00:06:47.139> you

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
because in the absence of regulation you

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.959 
because in the absence of regulation you
know<00:06:47.589> do<00:06:47.979> they<00:06:48.130> take<00:06:48.339> the<00:06:48.490> moral<00:06:48.669> high<00:06:48.819> ground

and put in the safety features which

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.860 
and put in the safety features which
really<00:06:51.339> pushes<00:06:51.759> the<00:06:51.849> cover<00:06:52.089> price<00:06:52.509> of<00:06:52.779> the

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
pressures the margins are very theor so

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.820 
pressures the margins are very theor so
you<00:07:07.449> know<00:07:07.539> putting<00:07:07.839> in<00:07:08.020> features<00:07:08.469> which<00:07:08.680> the

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
you know putting in features which the

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.010 
you know putting in features which the
customer<00:07:09.219> doesn't<00:07:09.250> appreciate<00:07:09.729> do<00:07:10.690> you<00:07:10.750> do<00:07:10.899> it

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.019 
customer doesn't appreciate do you do it
so<00:07:11.319> it<00:07:11.620> is<00:07:11.949> a<00:07:11.979> tough<00:07:12.190> one<00:07:12.250> over<00:07:12.639> there<00:07:12.759> but<00:07:13.000> i

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:13.029 
so it is a tough one over there but i

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.170

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
think you know in the end with safety

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.449 
think you know in the end with safety
such<00:07:16.690> an<00:07:16.870> emotional<00:07:17.380> subject<00:07:17.589> I<00:07:17.979> think

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:18.459 
such an emotional subject I think

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:20.550 
such an emotional subject I think
manufacturers<00:07:19.060> are<00:07:19.209> going<00:07:19.389> to<00:07:19.449> be<00:07:19.539> forced<00:07:19.839> to

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
manufacturers are going to be forced to

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.469 
manufacturers are going to be forced to
introduce<00:07:21.069> at<00:07:21.279> least<00:07:21.490> airbags<00:07:21.969> in<00:07:22.209> all<00:07:22.330> the

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
introduce at least airbags in all the

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.430 
introduce at least airbags in all the
variants<00:07:22.779> and<00:07:22.870> I<00:07:22.930> think<00:07:23.110> that's<00:07:23.259> a<00:07:23.349> great

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
variants and I think that's a great

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.260 
variants and I think that's a great
thing<00:07:23.709> so<00:07:23.889> again<00:07:24.159> coming<00:07:24.370> back<00:07:24.490> to<00:07:24.639> that<00:07:24.849> it's

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
thing so again coming back to that it's

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.990 
thing so again coming back to that it's
great<00:07:25.599> that<00:07:25.839> the<00:07:26.380> crash<00:07:27.099> worthiness<00:07:27.399> of<00:07:27.789> these

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
great that the crash worthiness of these

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.269 
great that the crash worthiness of these
cars<00:07:28.240> has<00:07:28.449> been<00:07:28.630> hydrated<00:07:29.319> and<00:07:29.589> I<00:07:29.680> think<00:07:29.889> more

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279 
cars has been hydrated and I think more

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.740 
cars has been hydrated and I think more
and<00:07:30.399> more<00:07:30.459> tests<00:07:30.849> and<00:07:30.940> cap<00:07:31.180> do<00:07:31.389> I<00:07:31.419> think<00:07:31.690> it

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
and more tests and cap do I think it

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.999 
and more tests and cap do I think it
will<00:07:31.839> give<00:07:31.959> a<00:07:31.990> clearer<00:07:32.259> picture<00:07:32.589> so<00:07:32.860> there's

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:33.009 
will give a clearer picture so there's

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:34.889 
will give a clearer picture so there's
no<00:07:33.130> place<00:07:33.339> to<00:07:33.370> hide<00:07:33.550> now<00:07:34.209> whether<00:07:34.419> your<00:07:34.599> car<00:07:34.779> is
