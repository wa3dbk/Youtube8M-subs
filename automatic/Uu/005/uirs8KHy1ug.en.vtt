00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.240 
using the gem tack
I<00:00:39.090> also<00:00:40.090> like<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.570> use<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.840> fan<00:00:41.530> brush<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.190> you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
is what's going to keep it from falling

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
is what's going to keep it from falling
out<00:01:22.759> or<00:01:23.759> being<00:01:24.060> pulled<00:01:24.390> out

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.730 

I<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.600> gem<00:01:33.870> tech'<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> little

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
I like to put my gem tech' in a little

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.420 
I like to put my gem tech' in a little
heavier<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.530> sure<00:01:37.800> that<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
heavier just to make sure that it's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:58.289 
heavier just to make sure that it's
completely<00:01:38.640> sealed

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.779 

another<00:01:59.079> thing<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.439> can<00:01:59.649> do<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.310> help<00:02:00.490> with

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
another thing you can do to help with

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.010 
another thing you can do to help with
this<00:02:01.079> step<00:02:02.079> is<00:02:02.409> if<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.890> have<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.850> vinyl<00:02:04.119> hole

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
this step is if you have the vinyl hole

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.620 
this step is if you have the vinyl hole
smaller<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:06.490> take<00:02:06.670> your<00:02:06.820> razor<00:02:07.000> blade<00:02:07.210> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
smaller just take your razor blade and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.020 
smaller just take your razor blade and
open<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.019> up<00:02:12.510> once<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.959> see<00:02:15.030> inside

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
open that up once you can see inside

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.449 
open that up once you can see inside
your<00:02:16.239> head<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.860> your<00:02:18.040> mohair<00:02:18.430> is

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
your head and see that your mohair is

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.670 
your head and see that your mohair is
covered<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:20.799> are<00:02:21.010> done<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.900> your<00:02:23.080> head<00:02:23.349> is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
covered you are done and your head is

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.210 
covered you are done and your head is
sealed<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.580> lay<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.120> flat<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> dry<00:02:26.220> and

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
sealed and then I lay it flat to dry and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.280 
sealed and then I lay it flat to dry and
it<00:02:27.340> should<00:02:27.489> take<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> couple<00:02:27.970> days<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:29.230> will

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
it should take a couple days and it will

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.650 
it should take a couple days and it will
be<00:02:29.349> ready
