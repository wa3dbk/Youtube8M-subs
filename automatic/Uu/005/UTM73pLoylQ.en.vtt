00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
to come out but hopefully they're not

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.320 
to come out but hopefully they're not
just<00:03:47.630> rushing<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.320> through<00:03:49.330> hopefully

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
just rushing it through hopefully

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.580 
just rushing it through hopefully
they're<00:03:50.450> gonna<00:03:50.510> take<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.900> tile<00:03:51.110> bit<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.560> know

never<00:03:52.340> seen<00:03:52.549> its<00:03:52.730> like<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.060> third<00:03:53.239> episode

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.840 
never seen its like it the third episode
I<00:03:53.930> think<00:03:54.799> it's<00:03:54.890> really<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.130> seven<00:03:55.489> chapters

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
I think it's really like seven chapters

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.660 
I think it's really like seven chapters
in<00:03:56.000> maybe<00:03:56.480> less<00:03:56.780> I'm<00:03:57.170> not<00:03:57.290> too<00:03:57.440> sure<00:03:57.670> but

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
in maybe less I'm not too sure but
