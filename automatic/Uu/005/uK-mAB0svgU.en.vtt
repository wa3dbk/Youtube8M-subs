something that's called certified seed
that<00:00:21.810> doesn't<00:00:22.110> mean<00:00:22.200> it's<00:00:22.349> organic<00:00:22.860> certified

it's certified which means that it's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.499 
it's certified which means that it's

way where it's you know got some person
low<00:00:30.840> percentage<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> weeds<00:00:31.680> but<00:00:31.860> it's<00:00:32.009> also

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
low percentage of weeds but it's also

been tested for diseases and it should

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
been tested for diseases and it should
be<00:00:34.530> free<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.860> disease<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.360> people

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
be free of disease and I think people

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
be free of disease and I think people
walk<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> fields<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.430> walk<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> fields

this is a problem because if you had
we're<00:01:01.530> buying<00:01:01.739> certified<00:01:02.309> seed<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.480> would

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
we're buying certified seed you would

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
we're buying certified seed you would
not<00:01:03.749> see<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.460> hey<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.730> what<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> does<00:01:06.060> is

commercial<00:01:17.130> labs<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.910> do<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.140> talked

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
commercial labs that do it we we talked

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.310 
commercial labs that do it we we talked
about<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> last<00:01:19.860> year<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> plant

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
about it last year with a plant

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490 
about it last year with a plant
pathologist<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:23.370> can<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.820> done<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.360> um<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
pathologist it can be done but um so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
pathologist it can be done but um so
this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:25.980> happens<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> save<00:01:26.790> your

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this is what happens when you save your

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520 
this is what happens when you save your
own<00:01:27.030> seed<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.720> may<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.230> of<00:01:28.350> these<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
own seed you may have one of these in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010 
own seed you may have one of these in
your<00:01:28.860> entire<00:01:29.100> field<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.820> big<00:01:30.300> deal<00:01:30.480> well

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
your entire field right big deal well

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
your entire field right big deal well
this<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.680> spreads<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.760> events<00:01:33.330> we<00:01:33.540> don't

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this thing spreads all events we don't

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.910 
this thing spreads all events we don't
hear<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.200> when

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
hear because when

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.620 
hear because when
and<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.190> don't<00:01:37.310> see<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.790> in<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> first<00:01:38.390> year

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
and you don't see that in the first year

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.990 
and you don't see that in the first year
but<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:38.900> he<00:01:39.049> saves<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.560> seed<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.700> went

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
but then he saves a seed so now we went

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.539 
but then he saves a seed so now we went
from<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.360> head<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.960> how<00:01:42.590> many<00:01:42.830> ten<00:01:43.070> thousand

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
from one head to how many ten thousand

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.670 
from one head to how many ten thousand
heads<00:01:43.729> maybe<00:01:44.060> or<00:01:44.479> ten<00:01:44.869> thousand<00:01:45.320> seeds<00:01:45.500> a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
heads maybe or ten thousand seeds a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.140 
heads maybe or ten thousand seeds a
habit<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.130> he<00:01:46.220> plants<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.670> out<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.970> next

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
habit so he plants that out the next

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.630 
habit so he plants that out the next
year<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.869> now<00:01:48.080> he's<00:01:48.229> got<00:01:48.409> 10,000<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.430> these

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
year and now he's got 10,000 of these

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.580 
year and now he's got 10,000 of these
what<00:01:49.940> you<00:01:50.060> may<00:01:50.210> not<00:01:50.360> even<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:51.080> here<00:01:51.350> and

what you may not even see from here and
by<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.190> time<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.640> harvest<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.270> won't<00:01:53.450> see

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
by the time you harvest it you won't see

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.859 
by the time you harvest it you won't see

remember last year we do now but it's
going<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:01.009> reduce<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.640> yield<00:02:02.630> yep<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.649> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220

going to reduce your yield yep and the
more<00:02:04.460> years<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.030> plant<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.259> figures

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
more years you plant that the figures

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.469 
more years you plant that the figures
yield<00:02:07.399> reduction<00:02:07.970> you're<00:02:08.090> going<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.300> have

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
yield reduction you're going to have

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.710 
yield reduction you're going to have
because<00:02:08.810> there's<00:02:08.989> no<00:02:09.170> seat<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.510> that's

because there's no seat so so so that's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.210 
because there's no seat so so so that's
one<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.320> that's<00:02:12.530> why<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.769> gotta<00:02:13.010> get<00:02:13.190> out

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
one of them that's why you gotta get out

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.830 
one of them that's why you gotta get out
and<00:02:13.430> scout<00:02:13.700> you're<00:02:13.910> here<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.390> i<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.600> asked<00:02:14.750> out

and scout you're here so i get asked out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.780 
and scout you're here so i get asked out
of<00:02:14.930> your<00:02:15.019> field<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.680> know<00:02:15.769> what's<00:02:16.130> there<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
of your field you know what's there and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.370 
of your field you know what's there and
you<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.570> if<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.900> have<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.110> problem

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
you know if you do have this problem

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.140 
you know if you do have this problem
don't<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:19.100> really<00:02:19.340> shouldn't<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.730> saving<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
don't you really shouldn't be saving the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.520 
don't you really shouldn't be saving the
scene<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.510> certainly<00:02:20.900> shouldn't<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.319> selling

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
scene you certainly shouldn't be selling

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.559 
scene you certainly shouldn't be selling
it<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.920> someone<00:02:22.100> else<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:23.269> you'll<00:02:23.540> be

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
it to someone else because you'll be

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.449 
it to someone else because you'll be
spreading<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.080> around<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.310> reason

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
spreading it around and and the reason

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.400 
spreading it around and and the reason
this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.790> not<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.360> conventional<00:02:26.900> production

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
this is not in conventional production

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.449 
this is not in conventional production
is<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:27.950> C<00:02:29.230> T<00:02:30.230> treatment<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.830> curious<00:02:31.280> oh

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
is because C T treatment is curious oh

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.300 
is because C T treatment is curious oh
yeah<00:02:32.330> regular<00:02:32.930> fungicidal<00:02:33.590> seed<00:02:33.860> treatments

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
yeah regular fungicidal seed treatments

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.280 
yeah regular fungicidal seed treatments
carrot<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:34.970> you're<00:02:35.239> saying<00:02:35.269> because<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:36.140> that

my own i guess and i will do a little
bit<00:03:00.829> of<00:03:01.000> seed<00:03:02.000> every<00:03:02.209> year<00:03:02.510> just<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.470> but

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
bit of seed every year just to see but

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.099 
bit of seed every year just to see but
but<00:03:05.269> generally<00:03:06.019> i<00:03:06.260> buy<00:03:06.829> certified<00:03:07.670> seed<00:03:08.180> every

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
but generally i buy certified seed every

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.470 
but generally i buy certified seed every
year
