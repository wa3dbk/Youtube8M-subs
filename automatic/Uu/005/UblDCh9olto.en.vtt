wanted to do it myself it would have

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.319 
wanted to do it myself it would have
become<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> necessity<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.700> somehow<00:00:38.969> figure<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
become a necessity to somehow figure it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.529 
become a necessity to somehow figure it
out<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.140> also<00:00:43.850> yeah<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> mean

it's it's this was a sag project you
know<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:51.230> out<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.710> money<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:56.270> the

know so it was I out of money so so the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
know so it was I out of money so so the
way<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.100> solved<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> problem<00:00:59.430> was<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
way I kind of solved the problem was a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
way I kind of solved the problem was a
by<00:00:59.820> doing<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.690> voices<00:01:01.050> myself<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
by doing the the voices myself but be I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.729 
by doing the the voices myself but be I
tend<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> write<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.609> ears<00:01:03.409> when<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> write

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
tend to write with my ears when I write

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.510 
tend to write with my ears when I write
a<00:01:04.979> joke<00:01:05.900> oftentimes<00:01:06.900> I'll<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.369> very

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a joke oftentimes I'll have a very very

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.160 
a joke oftentimes I'll have a very very
specific<00:01:08.760> idea<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.390> mind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> needs

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
specific idea in mind of what it needs

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
specific idea in mind of what it needs
how<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.770> joke<00:01:10.979> needs<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.369> sing<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.970> guess<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
how that joke needs to sing I guess is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
how that joke needs to sing I guess is
the<00:01:13.229> best<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the best way to put it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
the best way to put it
and<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:18.270> tends<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.869> easier<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.619> certain

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and it tends to be easier in certain

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
and it tends to be easier in certain
cases<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
cases for me to just do it the way I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.190 
cases for me to just do it the way I
want<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> try<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.049> walk<00:01:25.049> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
want it then to try and walk on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
want it then to try and walk on
eggshells<00:01:25.409> around<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.400> actor<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
eggshells around an actor to get them to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
eggshells around an actor to get them to
do<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.920> over<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> years<00:01:29.840> I've

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
do it now you know over the years I've

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
do it now you know over the years I've
developed<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.500> great<00:01:32.460> stable<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> actors<00:01:33.600> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
developed a great stable of actors on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
developed a great stable of actors on
the<00:01:33.840> shows<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> whom<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.299> know

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the shows all of whom have a you know

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.730 
the shows all of whom have a you know
have<00:01:36.570> adapted<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> style<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> show

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
have adapted to the style of the show

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.539 
have adapted to the style of the show
and<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.720> just<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and can do it just just as well as I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.910 
and can do it just just as well as I
would<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.820> myself<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.360> better<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.920> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
would do it myself if not better so it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.639 
would do it myself if not better so it's
it's<00:01:44.280> been<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:45.540> been<00:01:45.689> lucky<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's been that's been lucky so it's it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
it's been that's been lucky so it's it's
but<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> beginning<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but at the beginning it was it was it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
but at the beginning it was it was it
was<00:01:48.420> cost<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> desire<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
was cost and it was just a desire to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
was cost and it was just a desire to
hear<00:01:50.670> these<00:01:50.790> jokes<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> wanted

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
hear these jokes the way that I wanted

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
hear these jokes the way that I wanted
them<00:01:52.320> played<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> comes<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> Ted<00:01:54.299> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
them played so when it comes to Ted so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
them played so when it comes to Ted so
that<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> big<00:01:55.380> quantum<00:01:55.890> leap<00:01:56.040> over

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that so that's a big quantum leap over

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
that so that's a big quantum leap over
to<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> big<00:01:56.670> feature<00:01:56.880> film<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> basically

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to a big feature film and basically

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
to a big feature film and basically
doing<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.560> same<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.369> yeah<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> film

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
doing the same kind of thing yeah a film

one of the people for wanted people to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.260 
one of the people for wanted people to
forget<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.490> an<00:02:15.820> animated

forget that this was an animated

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.860 
forget that this was an animated
character<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.870> they<00:02:16.960> were<00:02:17.020> watching<00:02:17.260> and

character that they were watching and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
character that they were watching and
again<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.680> easier<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.490> do<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.730> myself

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
again it was just easier to do it myself

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.020 
again it was just easier to do it myself
there's<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.630> certain<00:02:22.960> style<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.800> voice<00:02:24.520> acting

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
there's a certain style of voice acting

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.460 
there's a certain style of voice acting
that<00:02:25.180> was<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> think<00:02:28.270> developed<00:02:28.930> by<00:02:29.170> dan

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
that was really I think developed by dan

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
easier to go in and do it myself because

easier to go in and do it myself because
it's<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:41.710> hard<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.950> find<00:03:42.160> that

Clark set up a pretty ingenious system

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.180 
Clark set up a pretty ingenious system
for<00:04:02.350> me<00:04:02.470> where<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> could<00:04:02.740> be<00:04:02.890> in<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> motion

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
for me where I could be in the motion

for me where I could be in the motion
capture<00:04:03.520> suit<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:06.070> monitor<00:04:06.490> was<00:04:06.700> set<00:04:06.910> up

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
capture suit and the monitor was set up

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.610 
capture suit and the monitor was set up
in<00:04:07.240> front<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.570> me<00:04:07.660> wherever<00:04:07.900> its<00:04:08.200> head<00:04:08.350> needed

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
in front of me wherever its head needed

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.590 
in front of me wherever its head needed
to<00:04:08.710> be<00:04:08.800> looking<00:04:09.130> if<00:04:09.280> Mark<00:04:09.580> was<00:04:09.790> over<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.360> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
to be looking if Mark was over here the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.890 
to be looking if Mark was over here the
monitor<00:04:10.990> would<00:04:11.110> be<00:04:11.230> here<00:04:11.440> so<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.650> was<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:12.900> looking

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
monitor would be here so I was a looking

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.880 
monitor would be here so I was a looking
in<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.080> right<00:04:14.200> direction<00:04:14.440> with<00:04:14.830> the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
in the right direction with the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.260 
in the right direction with the
performance<00:04:15.370> but<00:04:15.490> at<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.640> same<00:04:15.760> time<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.000> could

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
performance but at the same time I could

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.910 
performance but at the same time I could
also<00:04:16.390> be<00:04:16.540> monitoring<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.109> shot<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.739> same

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
also be monitoring the shot at the same

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.479 
also be monitoring the shot at the same
time

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
time

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.040 
time
and<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:20.560> sounds<00:04:21.040> like<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.160> lot<00:04:21.430> but<00:04:21.730> but<00:04:22.180> you

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
and it sounds like a lot but but you

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.440 
and it sounds like a lot but but you
know<00:04:23.400> animation<00:04:24.400> demands<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.030> every<00:04:25.300> day

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
know animation demands that every day

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.090 
know animation demands that every day
after<00:04:25.930> 10<00:04:26.290> years<00:04:26.470> of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100

the production schedule you have to kind

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.860 
the production schedule you have to kind
of<00:04:38.980> be<00:04:39.820> able<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.000> puzzle<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.510> out<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.810> your

of be able to puzzle that out in your
head<00:04:40.930> at<00:04:41.290> each<00:04:41.410> step<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.860> way<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.660> my<00:04:43.660> brain

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
head at each step of the way so my brain

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.710 
head at each step of the way so my brain
was<00:04:44.350> luckily<00:04:44.590> conditioned<00:04:45.550> by<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:46.270> animation

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
was luckily conditioned by the animation

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.320 
was luckily conditioned by the animation
medium<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.290> be<00:04:47.650> able<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:48.010> multitask<00:04:48.730> in<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
medium to be able to multitask in the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.720 
medium to be able to multitask in the
moment<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.780> think<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.680> think<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.130> do<00:04:51.190> think<00:04:51.610> that

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
moment I think I think I do think that

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.250 
moment I think I think I do think that
there's<00:04:51.970> something<00:04:52.030> kind<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.600> revolutionary

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
there's something kind of revolutionary

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.290 
there's something kind of revolutionary
in<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.620> model<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.460> film<00:04:54.790> it's<00:04:55.030> it's

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
in the model of that film it's it's

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.710 
in the model of that film it's it's
relatively<00:04:55.810> low<00:04:55.990> cost<00:04:56.440> for<00:04:57.010> her<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:58.030> payoff

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
relatively low cost for her the payoff

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.320 
relatively low cost for her the payoff
that<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:59.020> produced<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.120> basically

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
that it produced and and you basically

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.030 
that it produced and and you basically
had<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.840> mean<00:05:02.140> God<00:05:02.320> forbid<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.680> get<00:05:02.800> hit<00:05:02.920> by<00:05:02.950> a

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
had I mean God forbid you get hit by a

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.590 
had I mean God forbid you get hit by a
truck<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.550> know<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:06.330> entire<00:05:07.330> empire

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
truck you know the entire empire

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.860 
truck you know the entire empire
crumbles<00:05:08.290> but<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:09.430> know<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.760> be<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.360> think

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
crumbles but you know to be that I think

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.050 
crumbles but you know to be that I think
it's<00:05:11.260> at<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.470> very<00:05:11.710> high<00:05:11.920> level<00:05:12.060> demonstrating

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
it's at a very high level demonstrating

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.380 
it's at a very high level demonstrating
how<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.240> tools<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.720> we<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:13.930> today<00:05:14.340> allow

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
how the tools that we have today allow

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.120 
how the tools that we have today allow
for<00:05:16.390> an<00:05:16.960> incredible<00:05:17.740> amount<00:05:17.920> of<00:05:18.100> roll<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.940> and

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
for an incredible amount of roll and and

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.070 
for an incredible amount of roll and and
to<00:05:21.130> me<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> only<00:05:21.610> thing<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.750> we<00:05:22.900> did

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
to me the only thing that we did

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.130 
to me the only thing that we did
differently<00:05:23.470> was<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:24.400> we<00:05:25.180> we<00:05:25.720> treated

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
differently was that we we we treated

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.460 
differently was that we we we treated
the<00:05:26.230> animated<00:05:26.710> character<00:05:27.190> with<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.700> same

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
the animated character with the same

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
the animated character with the same
respect<00:05:29.470> as<00:05:29.890> we<00:05:30.040> would<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.250> live-action

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
respect as we would a live-action

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.460 
respect as we would a live-action
character<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.300> that's<00:05:31.420> oftentimes<00:05:32.200> what

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
character and that's oftentimes what

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.270 
character and that's oftentimes what
gets<00:05:32.740> lost<00:05:32.980> is<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:34.470> if<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.890> watch<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.250> movie

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
gets lost is that if you watch a movie

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.400 
gets lost is that if you watch a movie
with<00:05:36.760> with<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.090> know<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.780> live<00:05:37.960> actor<00:05:38.320> is

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
with with you know you the live actor is

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.440 
with with you know you the live actor is
doing<00:05:38.440> their<00:05:38.770> performance<00:05:39.340> on<00:05:39.640> camera<00:05:40.300> and

doing their performance on camera and

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.410 
doing their performance on camera and
then<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.620> animated<00:05:42.040> character<00:05:42.460> almost<00:05:42.970> at

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
then the animated character almost at

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.270 
then the animated character almost at
times<00:05:43.780> feels<00:05:44.050> like<00:05:44.200> an<00:05:44.290> afterafter<00:05:44.680> thought

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280

off the actor in the moment so an

off the actor in the moment so an
already<00:05:59.950> you're<00:06:00.940> you're<00:06:01.480> crippling<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:03.550> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
live we said how do we do this where the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.230 
live we said how do we do this where the
bear<00:06:10.480> has<00:06:10.660> all<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.020> same<00:06:11.170> advantages<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:12.100> a

bear has all the same advantages that a
that<00:06:13.240> a<00:06:13.270> live<00:06:13.450> actor<00:06:13.810> would<00:06:13.930> have<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.470> go

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
that a live actor would have to go

off-script

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
off-script

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.190 
off-script
in<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.700> moment<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:16.390> the<00:06:16.570> only<00:06:16.750> way<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.020> do

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
in the moment and the only way to do

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.460 
in the moment and the only way to do
that<00:06:17.350> was<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.620> do<00:06:17.920> all<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.400> mocap<00:06:18.870> live<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.320> I

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
that was to do all the mocap live and I

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.520 
that was to do all the mocap live and I
think<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.190> only<00:06:21.340> other<00:06:21.460> time<00:06:21.790> that's<00:06:22.530> been

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
think the only other time that's been

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.390 
think the only other time that's been
done<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:24.070> think<00:06:24.370> I<00:06:24.700> think<00:06:25.570> Andy<00:06:25.900> Serkis<00:06:26.170> yeah

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.410 

but<00:06:30.400> nobody's<00:06:30.700> done<00:06:30.850> it<00:06:30.880> in<00:06:31.000> a<00:06:31.030> comedy

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
but nobody's done it in a comedy

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.840 
but nobody's done it in a comedy
nobody's<00:06:31.720> done<00:06:31.840> it<00:06:31.870> with<00:06:32.170> with<00:06:32.440> such<00:06:33.280> you<00:06:33.700> know

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
nobody's done it with with such you know

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.190 
nobody's done it with with such you know
where<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.060> dialogue<00:06:34.510> is<00:06:34.720> really<00:06:34.960> driving

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
where the dialogue is really driving

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.219 
where the dialogue is really driving
everything<00:06:35.770> so<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:37.060> that<00:06:37.450> was<00:06:37.690> really<00:06:37.960> what

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
everything so that that was really what

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.890 
everything so that that was really what
I<00:06:38.350> think<00:06:38.410> made<00:06:38.800> this<00:06:38.950> debate<00:06:39.220> right

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
I think made this debate right

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.240 
I think made this debate right
two<00:06:40.110> things<00:06:40.229> that<00:06:40.350> you<00:06:40.470> wouldn't<00:06:40.740> even<00:06:40.979> think

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
two things that you wouldn't even think

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.090 
two things that you wouldn't even think
of<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.699> fact<00:06:41.910> that<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:43.440> mark<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:43.919> I<00:06:43.979> were

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
of the fact that the mark and I were

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.980 
of the fact that the mark and I were
mics<00:06:44.400> it's<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.790> same<00:06:44.970> way<00:06:45.150> that<00:06:45.570> I<00:06:45.630> wasn't

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
mics it's the same way that I wasn't

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.230 
mics it's the same way that I wasn't
sitting<00:06:46.199> in<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.590> in<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.919> cold<00:06:47.220> confines<00:06:47.910> of<00:06:48.180> a
