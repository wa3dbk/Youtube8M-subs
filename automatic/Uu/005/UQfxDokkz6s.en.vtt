the<00:00:42.180> first<00:00:42.420> observation<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.200> need<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the first observation we need to make is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
the first observation we need to make is
that<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> pole<00:00:45.660> would<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> negligible

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that the pole would have a negligible

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
that the pole would have a negligible
width<00:00:47.129> compared<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> length<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
width compared to the length of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.639 
width compared to the length of the
train<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.250> passing<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.530> could

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
train that is passing by it so we could

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
train that is passing by it so we could
easily<00:00:52.949> ignore<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.030> additional<00:00:54.570> distance<00:00:54.989> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
easily ignore the additional distance in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.090 
easily ignore the additional distance in
consideration<00:00:57.230> given<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> electric

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
consideration given that the electric

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.049 
consideration given that the electric
pole<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> stationary

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
pole is stationary

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.579 
pole is stationary
its<00:01:00.570> speed<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.320> zero<00:01:02.190> kilometers<00:01:02.760> per<00:01:03.090> hour

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
its speed is zero kilometers per hour

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
its speed is zero kilometers per hour
the<00:01:04.589> train<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.220> approaching<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.180> pole<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the train is approaching the pole at a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080 
the train is approaching the pole at a
speed<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.409> 90<00:01:07.830> kilometers<00:01:08.369> per<00:01:08.549> hour<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
speed of 90 kilometers per hour and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.679 
speed of 90 kilometers per hour and
would<00:01:09.630> completely<00:01:10.170> cross<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> 9<00:01:11.130> seconds

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
would completely cross it in 9 seconds

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.810 
would completely cross it in 9 seconds
what<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.720> interesting<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.350> note<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.400> also

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
what is interesting to note here is also

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
what is interesting to note here is also
that<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> unit<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> train<00:01:16.290> speed<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that the unit of train speed and the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
that the unit of train speed and the
time<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> cross<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> pole<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.409> uniform

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
time to cross the pole are not uniform

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
time to cross the pole are not uniform
whereas<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> kilometers<00:01:21.780> per<00:01:21.990> hour

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
whereas in kilometers per hour

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.070 
whereas in kilometers per hour
and<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.770> other<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> seconds<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.869> would

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and the other is in seconds this would

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
and the other is in seconds this would
be<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> first<00:01:25.590> hurdle<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.759> need<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
be the first hurdle we would need to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
be the first hurdle we would need to
cross<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> units

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
cross we would need to get the units

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
cross we would need to get the units
into<00:01:30.420> meters<00:01:30.780> per<00:01:31.020> second<00:01:37.040> let's<00:01:38.040> now

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
into meters per second let's now

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.450 
into meters per second let's now
visualize<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> next<00:01:39.299> sequence<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> train

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
visualize the next sequence the train

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
by the train would be nothing but the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.300 
by the train would be nothing but the
trains<00:01:50.670> length<00:01:51.030> itself<00:01:51.920> what<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> interesting

trains length itself what is interesting

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
trains length itself what is interesting
is<00:01:53.640> also<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> relative<00:01:54.600> speed<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.140> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
is also that the relative speed that we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
is also that the relative speed that we
need<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.979> calculate<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.670> relative<00:01:57.360> speed<00:01:57.960> in
