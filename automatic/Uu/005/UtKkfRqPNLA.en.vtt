however the reason I chose to Plasti Dip
under<00:02:15.600> these<00:02:15.720> circumstances<00:02:15.900> was<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:16.920> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
under these circumstances was because I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440 
under these circumstances was because I
was<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.370> sure<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.819> wanted<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> keep<00:02:18.270> the

wheels<00:02:18.630> red<00:02:18.990> or<00:02:19.200> black<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:21.870> powder

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
wheels red or black so I'm powder

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.870 
wheels red or black so I'm powder
coating<00:02:22.800> would<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.220> been<00:02:23.430> largely

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
coating would have been largely

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.850 
coating would have been largely
reversible<00:02:24.630> or<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.230> would<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.440> cost<00:02:25.620> me<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
reversible or it would have cost me a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.530 
reversible or it would have cost me a
lot<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.190> money<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.610> reverse<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.300> thought

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
lot of money to reverse it I thought

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.790 
lot of money to reverse it I thought
it's<00:02:28.080> not<00:02:28.260> worth<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
it's not worth it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.350 
it's not worth it
I've<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.220> got<00:02:29.370> them<00:02:29.490> plastic<00:02:29.640> did<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.180> how<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
like it and honestly I think I will be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.620 
like it and honestly I think I will be
changing<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.600> back<00:02:34.850> then<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.090> orange<00:02:36.420> rim

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
changing it back then that orange rim

45 tooth rear sprocket that has

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.480 
45 tooth rear sprocket that has
increased<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:56.820> talk<00:02:57.320> not<00:02:58.320> substantially<00:02:59.310> but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
increased my talk not substantially but

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.090 
increased my talk not substantially but
enough<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.060> noticeable<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.070> have<00:03:02.070> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
inside the bike just to account for the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.060

change in gearing and therefore the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.130 
change in gearing and therefore the

the guys have 7i watch it you get a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.820 
the guys have 7i watch it you get a
think<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.240> bit<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.510> weed<00:03:21.660> oh<00:03:21.690> hey<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:24.800> not<00:03:25.800> a

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
think some bit of a weed oh hey so not a

think some bit of a weed oh hey so not a
fender<00:03:26.160> eliminator<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.580> should<00:03:26.820> say<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.240> a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
fender eliminator I should say it's a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.080 
fender eliminator I should say it's a
tail<00:03:27.570> tidy<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.040> does<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.460> reduces

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
tail tidy so what that does is reduces

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.700 
tail tidy so what that does is reduces
the<00:03:30.300> size<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> rear<00:03:31.140> tail<00:03:31.410> these

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
the size of the rear tail these

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.560 
the size of the rear tail these

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.830 
have the official Honda rear cowl think
that<00:03:42.300> looks<00:03:42.480> rather<00:03:42.660> nice<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:46.590> top<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.950> that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
that looks rather nice on top of that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.250 
that looks rather nice on top of that
this<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.020> one<00:03:49.820> very<00:03:50.820> rare<00:03:51.210> item<00:03:51.480> actually<00:03:51.810> a

quill Evo 2 I have not seen a single one

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.250 
quill Evo 2 I have not seen a single one
of<00:03:55.740> these<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.220> Australia<00:03:56.760> as<00:03:57.660> far<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.140> I

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
of these in Australia as far as I know I

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.170 
of these in Australia as far as I know I
might<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.860> very<00:03:59.160> well<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.520> only<00:03:59.760> person

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
might be the very well the only person

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.040 
might be the very well the only person
that<00:04:00.210> has<00:04:00.480> one<00:04:01.850> gives<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.090> exhaust<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.780> nice

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
that has one gives the exhaust a nice

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.690 
that has one gives the exhaust a nice
deep<00:04:04.920> Rumble<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.950> huge

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
deep Rumble and as you see that is huge

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.550 
deep Rumble and as you see that is huge
I<00:04:12.030> think<00:04:12.060> that's<00:04:12.300> about<00:04:12.480> 5<00:04:12.750> centimeters

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
I think that's about 5 centimeters

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.370 
I think that's about 5 centimeters
very<00:04:14.280> few<00:04:14.520> exhausts<00:04:15.120> are<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.290> large<00:04:18.380> there's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
very few exhausts are that large there's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.400 
very few exhausts are that large there's
the<00:04:19.590> other<00:04:19.709> end<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.810> engine<00:04:21.810> case<00:04:22.020> slider

it a preload adjuster and that just

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.940 
it a preload adjuster and that just
tightens<00:04:47.160> up<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.310> front<00:04:48.200> so<00:04:49.200> yeah<00:04:49.440> guys<00:04:49.620> this

the<00:05:00.270> ABS<00:05:00.749> is<00:05:00.990> certainly<00:05:01.400> very<00:05:02.400> very<00:05:02.610> good<00:05:03.479> it

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
the ABS is certainly very very good it

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.890 
the ABS is certainly very very good it
saves<00:05:04.710> me<00:05:04.979> on<00:05:05.189> two<00:05:05.400> occasions<00:05:05.729> now<00:05:06.270> when<00:05:06.599> a<00:05:06.629> car

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
saves me on two occasions now when a car

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.140 
saves me on two occasions now when a car
both<00:05:07.529> it<00:05:07.770> both<00:05:07.979> instances<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.580> car<00:05:08.699> jumped<00:05:09.060> out

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
both it both instances of car jumped out

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.200 
both it both instances of car jumped out
in<00:05:09.270> front<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.569> me<00:05:12.620> fuel<00:05:13.620> economy<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.370> pretty

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
in front of me fuel economy is pretty

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.409 
in front of me fuel economy is pretty
good<00:05:15.509> I'm<00:05:16.319> quite<00:05:16.770> happy<00:05:16.919> with<00:05:17.249> it<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.879> tend<00:05:18.360> to

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
good I'm quite happy with it I tend to

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.499 
good I'm quite happy with it I tend to
attend<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.080> tends<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.409> cost<00:05:19.560> me<00:05:19.680> about<00:05:20.240> five<00:05:21.240> to

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
attend it tends to cost me about five to

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.279 
attend it tends to cost me about five to
eight<00:05:21.749> dollars<00:05:22.379> in<00:05:22.409> fuel<00:05:22.770> every<00:05:23.069> week<00:05:23.539> so<00:05:24.539> the

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
eight dollars in fuel every week so the

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.130 
eight dollars in fuel every week so the
costs<00:05:25.770> aren't<00:05:26.219> huge

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
costs aren't huge

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.270 
costs aren't huge
um<00:05:28.680> it's<00:05:29.130> certainly<00:05:29.550> very<00:05:29.700> smooth<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:34.280> it

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
um it's certainly very smooth and it

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.719 
um it's certainly very smooth and it
accelerates<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:37.640> quite

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
accelerates a quite

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.269 
accelerates a quite
a<00:05:40.259> reasonably<00:05:41.259> good<00:05:41.289> right<00:05:41.589> oh<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:42.099> nice

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
a reasonably good right oh that's a nice

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.489 
a reasonably good right oh that's a nice
block<00:05:43.529> so<00:05:44.529> despite<00:05:45.339> being<00:05:45.370> only<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.999> 500cc<00:05:46.960> or

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:47.499 
block so despite being only a 500cc or

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:52.619 
block so despite being only a 500cc or
technically<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.180> 471<00:05:49.180> CC<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.740> bike<00:05:51.069> is<00:05:51.879> faster

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
technically a 471 CC this bike is faster

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.999 
technically a 471 CC this bike is faster
than<00:05:52.809> I<00:05:53.080> would<00:05:53.139> say<00:05:53.499> roughly<00:05:55.319> 85%<00:05:56.319> of<00:05:56.800> what's

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
than I would say roughly 85% of what's

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.769
