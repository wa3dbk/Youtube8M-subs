00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.990
 Look, I'm here again this time to 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.250
 go to teach a little about paula 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.050
 hospitalized and say so is a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.600
 of the main techniques when you want 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:46.940
 play fast then in principle because 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 although the channel will try to show 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.820
 how does the soil make the classics and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.730
 classic and finally personal and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.129
 asked a lot to show some areas 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.890
 genital 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.960
 so come on 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.229
 It is important to keep in mind the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.240
 next when it comes to touching me fast 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.160
 in the capital 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.970
 many people think of the backpack in their hand 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.890
 left 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.090
 you play one million notes per 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.009
 second 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 Anyway, that whole thing does not 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.030
 I realized in mine in my humble 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.369
 Life opinion, who am I to? 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 say something but what I want 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.020
 say this if you want to help 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.420
 Coach you want to play fast 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 It's interesting that you control your hand. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.220
 right 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.320
 according to my daughter's move 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 because I have seen many analysts 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.350
 on shows that I go down here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 It cost me a lot to see shows going to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.740
 I really like this gift. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.939
 can not control with the right hand 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.159
 So it would be interesting if you 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.530
 the moment you begin to study 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.590
 make a move with the beloved mother and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.090
 training in my right hand this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.459
 but how am I going to train a right? 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.060
 to be a while the notion of how it works 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.400
 the wall to anyway good what do I have to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.799
 tell the following you have to try 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.160
 to edit so that your mother is 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.160
 comfortable 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:39.250
 possible device on the rope because 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.690
 away the people you will have less 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.130
 work time to move on quickly 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.900
 time to play fast right? 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.720
 if you push too far or if you 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.570
 hand moves the whole trend is that your 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.980
 solo are not next to the son more 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.300
