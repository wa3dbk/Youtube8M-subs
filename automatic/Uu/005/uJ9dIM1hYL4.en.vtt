my base layer on I am getting chilled

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
my base layer on I am getting chilled
and<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> wore<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.640> training<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and so I wore this on this training I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.260 
and so I wore this on this training I

come on today and while moving uphill
fairly<00:01:33.270> rapidly<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.740> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> adequately

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
fairly rapidly I was able to adequately

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.560 
fairly rapidly I was able to adequately
manage<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:37.020> temperature<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.420> make

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
manage my temperature and you know make

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.060 
manage my temperature and you know make
sure<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> don't<00:01:40.079> sweat<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.680> due<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
sure that I don't sweat out due to the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
sure that I don't sweat out due to the
mesh<00:01:44.070> gussets<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> underarms

mesh gussets that are on the underarms

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
mesh gussets that are on the underarms
they<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.229> effective<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.460> over

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

the big story with this jacket is how

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.750 
the big story with this jacket is how
water-resistant<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:07.980> when<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.340> put<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.670> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
water-resistant it is when we put it on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.910 
water-resistant it is when we put it on
our<00:03:08.820> hydrostatic<00:03:09.600> head<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.080> supported<00:03:10.830> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
our hydrostatic head it supported a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.150 
our hydrostatic head it supported a

hydrostatic head of 800 millimeters far

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.310 
hydrostatic head of 800 millimeters far
better<00:03:14.760> than<00:03:15.060> any<00:03:15.330> other<00:03:15.450> wind<00:03:15.840> jacket<00:03:16.110> we

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
better than any other wind jacket we

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.850 
better than any other wind jacket we
tested<00:03:16.740> so<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.550> could<00:03:17.970> keep<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.750> pretty<00:03:19.470> dry

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860

in a rainstorm in terms of wind

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.210 
in a rainstorm in terms of wind
resistance<00:03:24.350> you<00:03:25.350> know<00:03:25.470> how<00:03:25.650> those<00:03:25.920> are<00:03:26.100> all

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
resistance you know how those are all

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.460 
resistance you know how those are all
kind<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.580> interconnected<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.840> single<00:03:28.380> layer

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
kind of interconnected in a single layer

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.250 
kind of interconnected in a single layer
fabric<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.850> allowed<00:03:30.180> zero<00:03:30.750> wing<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.140> get

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
fabric it allowed zero wing to get

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.630 
fabric it allowed zero wing to get
through<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.070> story<00:03:32.310> with<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:32.580> jacket
