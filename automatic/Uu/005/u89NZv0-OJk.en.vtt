00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
for open applications but I really

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660

prefer<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.620> indicator<00:02:37.040> light<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.579> you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
prefer the indicator light so you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.119 
prefer the indicator light so you
couldn't<00:02:37.909> put<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.329> off<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.579> yeah<00:02:40.579> so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.920 
looks thinner and nicer and also the
scrolls<00:04:34.310> inverted<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.090> if<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.270> go<00:04:35.420> upwards

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
scrolls inverted so if you go upwards

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.510 
scrolls inverted so if you go upwards
it'll<00:04:36.230> go<00:04:36.350> downwards<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.010> if<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.220> go<00:04:37.340> down

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
it'll go downwards and if you go down

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.200 
it'll go downwards and if you go down
goes<00:04:38.450> up<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.680> scroll<00:04:40.070> really<00:04:40.370> hard<00:04:40.580> it

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
goes up and if you scroll really hard it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.000 
goes up and if you scroll really hard it
bounces<00:04:41.660> but<00:04:41.930> i<00:04:41.960> think<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.350> inversion<00:04:42.800> will

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
bounces but i think the inversion will

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.620 
bounces but i think the inversion will
take<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> little<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.700> get<00:04:43.880> used<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.180> but<00:04:44.330> i<00:04:44.389> think

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
take a little to get used to but i think

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.300 
take a little to get used to but i think
it's<00:04:44.780> nice<00:04:44.960> um<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:47.240> yeah<00:04:47.540> that's<00:04:47.830> OS<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> client

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
it's nice um so yeah that's OS a client

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.890
