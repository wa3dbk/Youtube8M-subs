Windows 7 users using the super bar if
you're<00:00:10.620> running<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.980> space<00:00:11.280> or<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.610> need<00:00:11.730> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
you're running our space or you need to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.850 
you're running our space or you need to
group<00:00:12.059> icons<00:00:12.450> together<00:00:12.809> then<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.500> will<00:00:13.710> be

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
group icons together then this will be

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
group icons together then this will be
useful<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.509> two<00:00:15.660> things

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
useful for you so we have two things

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.990 
useful for you so we have two things
here<00:00:16.080> standalone<00:00:16.650> stacks<00:00:17.010> two<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> seven

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
here standalone stacks two and seven

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.490 
here standalone stacks two and seven
stacks<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> demonstrate<00:00:18.840> both<00:00:19.289> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
stacks I'm going to demonstrate both of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
stacks I'm going to demonstrate both of
them<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.160> two<00:00:20.400> folders<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
them I have two folders here which I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.359 
them I have two folders here which I
cons<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.080> each<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.220> see

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
cons for each one so as you can see

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
cons for each one so as you can see
they're<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> be<00:00:23.820> different<00:00:24.090> icons<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they're going to be different icons so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.689 
they're going to be different icons so
in<00:00:25.560> stacks<00:00:25.800> icons<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:26.550> they're

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
in stacks icons you can see they're

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
in stacks icons you can see they're
different<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:27.510> put<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.750> side<00:00:27.990> by<00:00:28.019> side

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
different so I'll put them side by side

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
different so I'll put them side by side
and<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.920> compare<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.609> yourself

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and you can compare them for yourself

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.389 
and you can compare them for yourself
which<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> prefer<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.099> start

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
which one you prefer to use so start

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
there of grid and stack so let's go to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
there of grid and stack so let's go to
seven<00:02:20.260> stacks<00:02:20.500> now<00:02:20.770> seven<00:02:21.069> stacks<00:02:21.250> looks<00:02:21.520> a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
seven stacks now seven stacks looks a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
seven stacks now seven stacks looks a
little<00:02:21.730> bit<00:02:21.910> more<00:02:22.030> simple<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:23.020> works<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.440> same

going to create a shortcut my desktop
very<00:03:12.280> similar<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.640> how<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.269> other<00:03:13.600> one<00:03:13.750> was

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
very similar to how the other one was

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.300 
very similar to how the other one was
working<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.530> I'm<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:14.799> going<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:14.980> drag<00:03:15.130> this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
working so I'm just going to drag this

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.840 
working so I'm just going to drag this
in<00:03:15.519> click<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.780> there<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.799> go<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:18.220> now<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.640> a

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850

in click it and there we go I now have a
stack<00:03:19.209> as<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.570> see<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:19.840> different<00:03:20.200> to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
stack as you can see it's different to

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.590 
stack as you can see it's different to
the<00:03:20.380> OS<00:03:20.590> 10<00:03:20.769> *<00:03:21.010> one<00:03:21.130> looks<00:03:21.280> more<00:03:21.340> windows<00:03:22.000> 7<00:03:22.480> t

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
the OS 10 * one looks more windows 7 t

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.520 
the OS 10 * one looks more windows 7 t
if<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.260> makes<00:03:23.440> sense<00:03:23.579> ok<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.959> changes<00:03:26.350> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
if that makes sense ok so the changes to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.470

grid

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
grid

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.870 
grid
and<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.380> now<00:03:50.530> have<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:50.860> grid<00:03:51.220> style<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.790> can

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
and we now have it grid style as you can

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.240 
and we now have it grid style as you can
see<00:03:52.030> it's<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.300> OS<00:03:52.720> 10<00:03:53.440> style<00:03:53.710> like<00:03:53.890> this<00:03:53.920> is

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
see it's not OS 10 style like this is

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.570 
see it's not OS 10 style like this is
with<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.520> grid<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:55.960> very<00:03:56.200> very<00:03:56.740> similar

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
with the grid but it's very very similar

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.940 
with the grid but it's very very similar
so<00:03:58.330> this<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.630> seven<00:03:59.080> stacks<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.530> standalone

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
so this is seven stacks and standalone

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.680 
so this is seven stacks and standalone
stack<00:04:00.310> two<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.520> hope<00:04:00.730> I<00:04:00.850> haven't<00:04:01.000> confused<00:04:01.420> you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
stack two I hope I haven't confused you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.090 
stack two I hope I haven't confused you
but<00:04:01.870> check<00:04:02.110> them<00:04:02.260> both<00:04:02.350> out<00:04:02.560> see<00:04:02.860> which<00:04:02.980> one

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
but check them both out see which one

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.950 
but check them both out see which one
you<00:04:03.220> prefer<00:04:03.340> again<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.210> haven't<00:04:04.540> tested<00:04:04.720> them

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
you prefer again I haven't tested them

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.770 
you prefer again I haven't tested them
on<00:04:05.080> windows<00:04:05.380> XP<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.860> Vista<00:04:06.330> they<00:04:07.330> should<00:04:07.600> work

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
on windows XP and Vista they should work

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.450 
on windows XP and Vista they should work
with<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.170> quick<00:04:08.470> launch<00:04:08.590> bar<00:04:09.100> because

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
with the quick launch bar because

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.920 
with the quick launch bar because
they're<00:04:09.640> essentially<00:04:09.940> just<00:04:10.210> icons<00:04:10.660> and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
they're essentially just icons and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.780 
they're essentially just icons and
they're<00:04:11.050> just<00:04:11.200> popping<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.560> from<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:12.220> icon<00:04:12.580> or

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
they're just popping up from the icon or

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.180 
they're just popping up from the icon or
the<00:04:12.850> shortcut<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.110> this<00:04:14.470> should<00:04:14.650> work<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:15.010> you

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the shortcut so this should work for you

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.590 
the shortcut so this should work for you
