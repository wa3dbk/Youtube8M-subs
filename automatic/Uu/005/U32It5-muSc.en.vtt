now<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.530> could<00:01:14.980> wash<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.850> wheel<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.360> could

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
now we could wash the wheel we could

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.900 
now we could wash the wheel we could
scrub<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> wheel<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:18.040> problem<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.580> if<00:01:18.760> we

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
scrub the wheel the problem is if we

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.760 
scrub the wheel the problem is if we
wash<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.450> wheel<00:01:19.600> with<00:01:19.780> water<00:01:20.050> we're<00:01:20.560> going<00:01:20.710> to

wash the wheel with water we're going to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.830 
wash the wheel with water we're going to
obviously<00:01:21.220> have<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.580> wait<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:21.840> substantially

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
obviously have to wait a substantially

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.450 
obviously have to wait a substantially
long<00:01:22.990> time<00:01:23.260> for<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.560> wheel<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.920> dry<00:01:24.160> so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
long time for the wheel to dry so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.130 
long time for the wheel to dry so
because<00:01:24.820> these<00:01:24.970> wheels<00:01:25.210> aren't<00:01:25.540> super<00:01:25.930> dirty

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
because these wheels aren't super dirty

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.170 
because these wheels aren't super dirty
we're<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.010> use<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.310> pre<00:01:27.490> dip<00:01:27.670> spray<00:01:27.940> and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
we're going to use the pre dip spray and

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.570 
we're going to use the pre dip spray and
a<00:01:28.540> microfiber<00:01:29.020> rag<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.680> we're<00:01:30.190> going<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.370> give

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
a microfiber rag and we're going to give

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.940 
a microfiber rag and we're going to give
them<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.820> nice<00:01:31.000> little<00:01:31.180> bath<00:01:31.480> now<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:32.020> don't<00:01:32.260> like

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
them a nice little bath now I don't like

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.010 
them a nice little bath now I don't like
to<00:01:32.980> spray<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.700> pre<00:01:33.909> dip<00:01:34.090> directly<00:01:34.600> onto<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
to spray the pre dip directly onto the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.500 
to spray the pre dip directly onto the
wheel<00:01:35.230> because<00:01:36.130> sometimes<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:37.000> overdo

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
wheel because sometimes you can overdo

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.210 
wheel because sometimes you can overdo
it<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:37.990> little<00:01:38.200> areas<00:01:38.320> like<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.770> lug<00:01:38.980> nuts

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
it and in little areas like the lug nuts

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.010 
it and in little areas like the lug nuts
if<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.610> over<00:01:39.940> saturate<00:01:40.480> it<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.720> there<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:40.960> you

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
if you over saturate it in there and you

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.450 
if you over saturate it in there and you
can't<00:01:41.260> get<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.500> out<00:01:41.620> you've<00:01:42.040> got<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.220> wait<00:01:42.430> for

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
can't get it out you've got to wait for

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.550 
can't get it out you've got to wait for
that<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.850> dry<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.510> dip<00:01:43.690> your<00:01:43.840> wheel<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.200> spray

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
that to dry to dip your wheel so I spray

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
that to dry to dip your wheel so I spray
it<00:01:44.680> right<00:01:44.830> onto<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.250> microfiber<00:01:46.030> rag<00:01:46.300> and

it right onto the microfiber rag and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.340 
it right onto the microfiber rag and
I'll<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.950> take<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.340> spoke<00:01:48.670> by<00:01:48.909> spoke<00:01:49.300> all<00:01:50.080> the

I'll just take it spoke by spoke all the
way<00:01:50.470> around<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> wheel<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.960> sure

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
way around the wheel and just make sure

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.200 
way around the wheel and just make sure
I<00:01:53.140> give<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.590> good<00:01:53.740> cleaning<00:01:54.100> now<00:01:54.670> obviously

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
wheels like I said just have a little

bit of dusting just a little bit of
debris<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.750> that's<00:02:08.709> what<00:02:08.920> we're<00:02:09.069> going<00:02:09.190> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
debris and that's what we're going to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.369 
debris and that's what we're going to
get<00:02:09.399> off<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.849> surface<00:02:10.299> of<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> dip<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.230> that

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
get off the surface of the dip so that

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.510 
get off the surface of the dip so that
when<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:11.560> put<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> new<00:02:11.890> vintage<00:02:12.310> gold<00:02:12.550> dip<00:02:12.760> on

works really well now sometimes I love
to<00:02:15.770> see<00:02:15.980> comments<00:02:16.370> whenever<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:17.300> do<00:02:17.450> wheel

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
to see comments whenever we do wheel

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.420 
to see comments whenever we do wheel
videos<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.320> will<00:02:18.470> say<00:02:18.650> why<00:02:18.890> didn't<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.220> take

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
videos that will say why didn't you take

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
videos that will say why didn't you take
the<00:02:19.580> wheels<00:02:19.790> off<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.120> car<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.510> people<00:02:21.050> think

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the wheels off the car and people think

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.500 
the wheels off the car and people think
the<00:02:21.500> only<00:02:21.680> proper<00:02:22.160> way<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.340> do<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.970> to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the only proper way to do this is to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.210 
the only proper way to do this is to
take<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.870> wheel<00:02:24.050> off<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.320> car<00:02:24.770> if<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.040> leave

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
take the wheel off the car if you leave

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.350 
take the wheel off the car if you leave
the<00:02:25.370> wheel<00:02:25.520> on<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> car<00:02:25.970> you're<00:02:26.120> doing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
the wheel on the car you're doing

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.570 
the wheel on the car you're doing
something<00:02:26.600> wrong<00:02:26.900> well<00:02:27.230> I'll<00:02:28.100> be<00:02:28.280> honest<00:02:28.520> with

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
something wrong well I'll be honest with

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.740 
something wrong well I'll be honest with
you<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.820> reason<00:02:28.850> why<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.210> don't<00:02:29.330> take<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
you the reason why I don't take the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.240 
you the reason why I don't take the
wheels<00:02:29.930> off<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.350> car<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.770> because<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.100> don't

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
wheels off the car is because I don't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.910 
wheels off the car is because I don't
want<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.790> I'm<00:02:32.000> not<00:02:32.540> dipping<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.140> inside<00:02:33.620> of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
want to I'm not dipping the inside of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.860 
want to I'm not dipping the inside of
the<00:02:34.370> barrel<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.940> wheel<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.300> understand

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
the barrel of the wheel I can understand

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.360 
the barrel of the wheel I can understand
if<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.080> was<00:02:36.110> dipping<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> inside<00:02:36.950> barrel<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
if I was dipping the inside barrel the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.370 
if I was dipping the inside barrel the
wheel<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.850> would<00:02:38.510> take<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> wheel<00:02:38.960> off<00:02:38.990> that's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
wheel I would take the wheel off that's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.540 
wheel I would take the wheel off that's
really<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.680> only<00:02:39.830> way<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> get<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.340> done

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
really the only way to get that done

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.240 
really the only way to get that done
properly<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.600> 99%<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.620> people<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.040> dip

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
properly but 99% of people that dip

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.370 
properly but 99% of people that dip
their<00:02:43.460> wheels<00:02:43.670> are<00:02:44.120> only<00:02:44.180> dipping<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.110> front

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
their wheels are only dipping the front

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.560 
their wheels are only dipping the front
face<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.920> wheel<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.150> yet<00:02:47.450> we

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570

and then you just extend the bag up over

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.160 
and then you just extend the bag up over
the<00:03:11.840> brake<00:03:12.700> calipers<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.030> brake<00:03:14.240> rotors

away from the face of the wheel to make

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.040

that you extend the Plasti Dip up on to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.699 
that you extend the Plasti Dip up on to
the<00:04:12.599> sidewall<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.170> tire

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
building it up there is going to make it

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.060 
building it up there is going to make it
a<00:04:15.540> lot<00:04:15.750> easier<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.260> peel<00:04:16.440> off<00:04:16.650> when<00:04:16.950> you're

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
a lot easier to peel off when you're

done with the project the second coat is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.960 
done with the project the second coat is
very<00:04:22.500> simple<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.190> don't<00:04:23.520> build<00:04:23.669> up<00:04:23.820> the
