compress it we push it in now if that's
not<00:01:22.680> smooth<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
not smooth like what they have but this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.859 
not smooth like what they have but this
was<00:01:24.509> called<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.340> hard<00:01:26.340> rubber<00:01:26.580> float<00:01:27.420> finish

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
was called a hard rubber float finish

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.469 
was called a hard rubber float finish
and<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.560> does<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.130> wall<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.000> still

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and what that does that wall can still

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.960 
and what that does that wall can still
breathe<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.670> take<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.180> green<00:01:33.720> sponge<00:01:34.140> float

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
breathe or you take a green sponge float

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.370 
breathe or you take a green sponge float
now<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> hit<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.960> my<00:01:36.990> joints

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
now I'm going to hit all my joints

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
now I'm going to hit all my joints
anyway<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.070> how<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> water<00:01:38.670> that's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
anyway you see how this water that's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
anyway you see how this water that's
going<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.530> wall<00:01:40.890> again<00:01:42.229> can<00:01:43.229> still

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
going on it that wall again can still

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.639 
going on it that wall again can still
breathe<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> wall<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.720> breathe<00:01:45.990> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
breathe and if a wall can breathe it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.490 
breathe and if a wall can breathe it's
less<00:01:47.009> likely<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> hairline<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
less likely to hairline but what I

they the reason they did this is four
they<00:02:20.230> wanted<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> enlarge<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.580> door<00:02:21.819> so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
they wanted to enlarge it in the door so

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.210

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
and what that means is that wall when

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.610 
and what that means is that wall when
the<00:02:38.470> Sun<00:02:38.739> beats<00:02:39.010> down<00:02:39.160> on<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:41.019> going<00:02:41.410> to

the Sun beats down on it is going to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
the Sun beats down on it is going to

it's<00:02:48.310> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.519> heat<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.030> plywood<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.569> if

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
it's going to heat up the plywood and if

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.780 
it's going to heat up the plywood and if

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
that plywood has moisture in it because

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.449 
that plywood has moisture in it because
it's<00:02:51.970> green<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.510> most<00:02:52.780> houses<00:02:53.319> do<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:54.250> going

it's green and most houses do it's going
