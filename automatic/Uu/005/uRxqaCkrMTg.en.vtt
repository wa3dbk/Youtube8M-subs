00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
think that was greg hardy and greg hardy

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.330 
think that was greg hardy and greg hardy
I<00:03:04.110> guess<00:03:04.380> doesn't<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> good<00:03:05.099> hands

rating<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.910> game<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.690> afterwards<00:03:07.260> it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
rating in this game then afterwards it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.259 
rating in this game then afterwards it's
starting<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.010> look<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.220> more<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.000> same

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
starting to look like more of the same

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.360 
starting to look like more of the same
third<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.080> four<00:03:10.290> he<00:03:10.470> wasn't<00:03:10.709> able<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.980> get<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
third and four he wasn't able to get it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.460 
third and four he wasn't able to get it
that<00:03:11.549> leads<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.030> get<00:03:12.150> another<00:03:12.569> field<00:03:12.989> goal<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that leads to get another field goal so

mount a comeback so the most important

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.820 
mount a comeback so the most important
thing<00:05:18.539> i'm<00:05:18.659> thinking<00:05:18.690> right<00:05:19.110> here<00:05:19.349> is<00:05:19.500> don't

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
thing i'm thinking right here is don't

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.860 
thing i'm thinking right here is don't
be<00:05:20.009> predictable<00:05:20.789> so<00:05:21.000> i'm<00:05:21.240> gonna<00:05:21.389> continue

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
be predictable so i'm gonna continue

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.089 
be predictable so i'm gonna continue
running<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.139> ball<00:05:22.409> because<00:05:22.620> that's<00:05:22.889> been

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
running the ball because that's been

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.040 
running the ball because that's been
working<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.669> far<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.000> can<00:05:24.090> see<00:05:24.210> Eddie<00:05:24.719> Lacy
