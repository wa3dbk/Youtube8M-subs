the<00:00:24.750> purpose<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> dual<00:00:25.560> booting<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> put

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
the purpose of dual booting is to put

like windows and you like Linux but you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.690 
like windows and you like Linux but you
don't<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.170> two<00:00:34.410> separate<00:00:34.800> computers<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> put

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
don't have two separate computers to put

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.950 
don't have two separate computers to put
them<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.570> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> mess<00:00:36.930> with

them on and you don't want to mess with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.790 
them on and you don't want to mess with
the<00:00:37.230> limitations<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.280> virtual<00:00:38.969> pcs<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:40.559> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the limitations of virtual pcs then you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.040 
the limitations of virtual pcs then you
can<00:00:40.980> dual<00:00:41.309> boot<00:00:41.670> both<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> operating

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
can dual boot both of the operating

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
can dual boot both of the operating
systems<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.860> able<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.430> both<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> them

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
systems and be able to put both of them

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
systems and be able to put both of them
on<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.440> computer<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> run<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.160> independently

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
on a computer and run them independently

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
on a computer and run them independently
without<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.510> many<00:00:48.719> conflicts<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.280> there's<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
without that many conflicts so there's a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520
