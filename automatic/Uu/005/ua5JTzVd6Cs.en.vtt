focus<00:00:44.250> let<00:00:44.460> me<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.469> get<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
focus let me see if I can get a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.900 
focus let me see if I can get a
different<00:00:46.710> view<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:49.489> well<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.670> about

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
different view of that well that's about

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
different view of that well that's about
the<00:00:51.030> best<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.360> gets<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.800> that's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the best it gets but so that's that's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.760 
the best it gets but so that's that's

what gtn is and it comes on mini knives
they<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.520> expensive<00:01:00.510> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
they don't all have to be expensive this

knives<00:01:43.130> point<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:45.049> they<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:47.280> not

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
knives point there is that they do not

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
knives point there is that they do not
have<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.420> expensive<00:01:48.990> where<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
have to be all expensive where the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.200 
have to be all expensive where the
military<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.369> probably<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> most<00:01:50.880> expensive

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
military is probably the most expensive

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.870 
military is probably the most expensive
knife<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.049> pile<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.220> what's<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.729> great

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
knife in this pile so what's so great

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.560 
knife in this pile so what's so great
about<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.270> military<00:01:54.420> g10<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:56.570> much

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
about the military g10 it is much

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.179 
about the military g10 it is much
thicker<00:01:58.229> than<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> normally<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.450> on

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
thicker than what you normally see on

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.880 
thicker than what you normally see on
other<00:02:02.189> knives<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> look<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
other knives so if you look at the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.699 
other knives so if you look at the
construction<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.200> no<00:02:09.709> really

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
construction of it there's no really

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.880 
construction of it there's no really
internal<00:02:11.250> steel<00:02:12.239> framing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
internal steel framing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
internal steel framing
you<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.880> liner<00:02:15.090> lock<00:02:15.330> right

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you do have this the liner lock right

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.100 
you do have this the liner lock right
here<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.400> kind<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> runs<00:02:17.910> through<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.930> gets

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
here it kind of runs through and gets

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.290 
here it kind of runs through and gets
thinner<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> back<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> knife<00:02:20.940> about

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
thinner to the back of the knife about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.010 
thinner to the back of the knife about
it<00:02:21.420> right<00:02:21.690> about<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> g10<00:02:24.480> slabs

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
it right about here but the g10 slabs

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.730 
it right about here but the g10 slabs
are<00:02:25.910> much<00:02:26.910> thicker<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.720> more<00:02:28.550> sturdy<00:02:29.550> than

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
are much thicker and more sturdy than

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.510 
are much thicker and more sturdy than
other<00:02:31.740> knives<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.140> high<00:02:34.140> durability

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
other knives so high durability

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.590 
other knives so high durability
durability<00:02:35.520> no<00:02:36.470> flexing<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:39.420> is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
durability no flexing at all and this is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.060 
durability no flexing at all and this is
actually<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.080> only<00:02:40.200> knife<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.830> have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
actually the only knife that I have

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.710 
actually the only knife that I have
where<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.670> full<00:02:43.160> g10<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.880> pretty<00:02:46.550> thick

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
where it's full g10 of a pretty thick

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.990 
where it's full g10 of a pretty thick
construction<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.739> here's<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.790> comparison

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
construction so here's a comparison

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.240 
construction so here's a comparison
right<00:02:52.670> Kershaw<00:02:53.670> skyline<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:58.070> this<00:02:59.070> is

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
right Kershaw skyline it this is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.009 
right Kershaw skyline it this is
probably<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> closest<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.810> sinned

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
probably the closest one I have sinned

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.229 
probably the closest one I have sinned
those<00:03:01.230> variable<00:03:01.739> thanks<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.370> Keaton<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
those variable thanks that Keaton is a

those variable thanks that Keaton is a
hair<00:03:03.510> thicker<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.640> can<00:03:05.790> see<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.110> this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
hair thicker you can see the but this

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.960 
hair thicker you can see the but this
one<00:03:07.380> has<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> liner<00:03:07.800> right<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.250> okay<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:10.970> if

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
one has a liner right here okay and if

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.699 
one has a liner right here okay and if
you<00:03:12.420> compare<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> common<00:03:14.180> tenacious

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
you compare it to the common tenacious

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.330 
you compare it to the common tenacious
right<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:17.400> g10<00:03:18.180> scales<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.780> pretty<00:03:19.019> thin<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
right the g10 scales are pretty thin and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.780 
right the g10 scales are pretty thin and
it's<00:03:23.340> lined<00:03:23.730> steel<00:03:24.360> liners<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.519> okay<00:03:26.519> which

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it's lined steel liners here okay which

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.900 
it's lined steel liners here okay which
makes<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.180> heavier<00:03:30.170> same<00:03:31.170> with<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:33.110> car<00:03:34.110> car

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
makes it heavier same with the car car

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.740 
makes it heavier same with the car car
steel<00:03:35.910> liners<00:03:38.000> sometimes<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.180> steel<00:03:39.420> liners

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
steel liners sometimes the steel liners

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.380 
steel liners sometimes the steel liners
are<00:03:39.959> skeletonize<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.890> drilled<00:03:41.250> out<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:42.180> one

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
are skeletonize are drilled out this one

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.630 
are skeletonize are drilled out this one
is<00:03:42.570> hard<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> see<00:03:43.110> here<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:43.470> camera<00:03:43.829> though<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
is hard to see here on camera though and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.600 
is hard to see here on camera though and
then<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.820> see<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.570> leak<00:03:50.989> also<00:03:51.989> lined<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.250> not

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
then you see the leak also lined and not

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.360 
then you see the leak also lined and not
drilled<00:03:54.420> out<00:03:56.209> okay<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:58.049> then<00:03:58.620> finally<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
drilled out okay and then finally you

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.900 
drilled out okay and then finally you
have<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.299> example<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.200> GTN<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:02.489> almost

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
have this example of the GTN it's almost

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.350 
have this example of the GTN it's almost
just<00:04:03.860> window<00:04:04.860> dressing<00:04:04.890> for<00:04:05.670> this<00:04:05.790> knife<00:04:06.030> that

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
just window dressing for this knife that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.830 
just window dressing for this knife that
nitrous<00:04:06.900> striker<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:11.060> internal<00:04:12.060> steel<00:04:12.570> here

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
nitrous striker the internal steel here

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.150 
nitrous striker the internal steel here
is<00:04:12.900> not<00:04:13.079> drilled<00:04:13.440> out<00:04:13.590> but<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.859> still<00:04:14.010> pretty

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
is not drilled out but it's still pretty

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.969 
is not drilled out but it's still pretty
light<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.450> GTN<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.109> thing<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.440> real

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
light but the GTN on this thing is real

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.940 
light but the GTN on this thing is real
thin<00:04:17.609> almost<00:04:18.060> fragile<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.229> I've<00:04:19.680> talked

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
thin almost fragile and I've talked

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.530 
thin almost fragile and I've talked
about<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.400> videos<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.359> this

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
about that in videos on this

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.380 
about that in videos on this
so<00:04:23.050> again<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.770> summarize<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.150> what

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
so again to summarize you know what

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.600 
so again to summarize you know what
makes<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.780> military<00:04:26.260> special<00:04:26.920> right<00:04:27.250> well

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
makes the military special right well

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.740 
makes the military special right well
it's<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.270> high<00:04:28.510> grade<00:04:28.870> high<00:04:29.200> quantity<00:04:32.460> g10

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
it's the high grade high quantity g10

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.990 
it's the high grade high quantity g10
again<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.870> g10<00:04:35.260> is<00:04:35.560> good<00:04:36.400> through<00:04:36.670> all

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
again the g10 is good through all

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.490 
again the g10 is good through all
whether<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:38.560> good<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:38.830> water<00:04:40.320> holds<00:04:41.320> good

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
whether it's good in water holds good

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.620 
whether it's good in water holds good
grip<00:04:41.890> right<00:04:42.610> it's<00:04:43.000> pretty<00:04:43.180> indestructible

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
grip right it's pretty indestructible

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.250 
grip right it's pretty indestructible
and<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.370> military<00:04:45.370> has<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.030> high<00:04:46.360> volume<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:47.080> it

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and the military has a high volume of it

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.150 
and the military has a high volume of it
so<00:04:48.990> many<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.260> may<00:04:50.500> have<00:04:50.530> already<00:04:50.770> known

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
so many of you may have already known

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.820 
so many of you may have already known
that<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.840> something<00:04:53.110> interesting<00:04:53.740> to

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
that but just something interesting to

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.730 
that but just something interesting to
talk<00:04:53.980> about<00:04:54.040> later
