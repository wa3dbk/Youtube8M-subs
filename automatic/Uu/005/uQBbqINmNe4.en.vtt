want it to be like a three minute hall

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
want it to be like a three minute hall
so<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.630> figured<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.110> would<00:00:10.530> do<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> styling<00:00:11.070> video

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
so I figured I would do a styling video

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.589 
so I figured I would do a styling video
as<00:00:11.370> well<00:00:11.400> because<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.880> did<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.330> things

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
as well because I did get some things

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.390 
as well because I did get some things
that<00:00:12.929> may<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.740> little<00:00:13.889> bit<00:00:14.040> difficult<00:00:14.190> for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that may be a little bit difficult for

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730 
that may be a little bit difficult for
some<00:00:14.610> people<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.880> style<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.080> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
some people of style if you like this so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040 
some people of style if you like this so
lately<00:00:17.460> I've<00:00:17.820> really<00:00:18.119> been<00:00:18.240> into<00:00:18.570> printed

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
lately I've really been into printed

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.800 
lately I've really been into printed
leggings<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.300> really<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.689> really

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
leggings and I really really really

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
leggings and I really really really
badly<00:00:22.230> wanted<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> Disney<00:00:23.400> Princess

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
badly wanted to get the Disney Princess

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820 
badly wanted to get the Disney Princess
ones<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.779> thought<00:00:24.960> those<00:00:25.140> were<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.590> like

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
ones but I thought those were so like

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
ones but I thought those were so like
completely<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.880> comfort<00:00:27.060> zone<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
completely out of my comfort zone so I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.089 
completely out of my comfort zone so I
definitely<00:00:27.990> didn't<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.470> those<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> got

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
definitely didn't get those but I got

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
definitely didn't get those but I got
some<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.820> will<00:00:29.970> sort<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> hopefully<00:00:30.689> ease<00:00:30.929> me

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
some that will sort of hopefully ease me

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.170 
some that will sort of hopefully ease me
into<00:00:31.380> getting<00:00:31.590> leggings<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.369> those<00:00:32.669> because

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
into getting leggings like those because

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
into getting leggings like those because
I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.809> they're<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.079> cute<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.770> don't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
are basically the same thing but with a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
are basically the same thing but with a
different<00:01:38.579> pattern<00:01:38.790> again<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> white<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
different pattern again the white and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
different pattern again the white and
black<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> time<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> pattern<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.850> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
black but this time the pattern I like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
black but this time the pattern I like
this<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.659> bit<00:01:42.899> better<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.740> does

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
this one a little bit better and so does

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.179 
this one a little bit better and so does
Brian<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.710> don't<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:46.890> sugar

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Brian and it's like I don't make sugar

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.069 
Brian and it's like I don't make sugar
skulls<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:47.970> basically<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.630> skull

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
skulls but it's basically just a skull

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
skulls but it's basically just a skull
pattern<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.390> looks<00:01:51.570> like

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
pattern like this it just looks like

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.069 
pattern like this it just looks like
that<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.960> really

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that all the way to you and I really

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
that all the way to you and I really
really<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:55.649> ideas<00:01:56.100> are<00:01:56.219> soaked<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
really like these ideas are soaked you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.679 
really like these ideas are soaked you
actually<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> little<00:01:57.329> bit<00:01:57.540> more

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
actually like these a little bit more

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.810 
actually like these a little bit more
than<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> geometric<00:01:58.530> ones<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.640> these

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
than the geometric ones because these

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
than the geometric ones because these
are<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.840> don't<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.500> how<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> explain<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
are I don't know how to explain it just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.530 
are I don't know how to explain it just
a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.430> bit<00:02:02.610> easier<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> wear<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
a little bit easier to wear if that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.639 
a little bit easier to wear if that
makes<00:02:03.719> any<00:02:03.869> sense<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.530> they're

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
makes any sense because they're

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
makes any sense because they're
basically<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> same<00:02:05.159> thing<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.509> like

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
basically the same thing but I like

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830 
basically the same thing but I like
these<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> lot<00:02:07.259> too<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:09.539> will<00:02:09.720> hopefully

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
these a lot too and this will hopefully

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.760 
these a lot too and this will hopefully
ease<00:02:10.319> me<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.739> wearing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
ease me into wearing
