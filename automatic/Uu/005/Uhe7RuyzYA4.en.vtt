00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.460
 so for a little tutorial make-up you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 will see he really make up 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 super simple it was to show you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 how I apply and especially how and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 the actual rendering of this foundation 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.040
 so mineral lille and the lot so 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000
 it was a foundation that presents itself 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.289
 in powder form 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.640
 so there you will actually see 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 I use a small box that I had 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.119
 bought on the site has a nature done 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.400
 it's a box that consists of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 three powder foundation so in all 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.279
 small format 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 so there is also a powder of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 graduates for the face and a little 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 kabuki but that I do not use I 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 prefer to use my pass in the bottom of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.620
 dyed with so I would put you in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.420
 anyway do not worry all 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
 references either in info bar 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.149
 so directly in the video 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.500
 so the rendering actually will give this 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.360
 you will see the foundation and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 maybe a point too clear for me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 right now because I still 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.480
 took a lot of colors but that's it 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 will give you a bit of an idea of ​​the rendering and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 you will see that we can mix two 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.109
 foundation can be done a little 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 a custom color good as I you 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.469
 will say it will be really a little too much 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 clear to me but it will give you a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.880
 idea of ​​how to apply it a little bit 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.680
 at the level of coverage and level 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.909
 general rendering that's so that you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 interested in I let you look so 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.520
 this video I do lots of kisses and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 otherwise I'll find you for a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.510
 next video 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510
