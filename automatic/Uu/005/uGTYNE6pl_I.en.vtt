what's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.359> standard<00:00:25.050> rocket<00:00:25.410> launcher<00:00:25.710> with

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
what's a standard rocket launcher with

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.130 
what's a standard rocket launcher with
one<00:00:26.039> exception<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.609> setting<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.180> agile<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
one exception I'm setting it to agile to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
one exception I'm setting it to agile to
make<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> rocket<00:00:28.680> slower<00:00:30.380> okay<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.439> let's<00:00:32.219> go

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
make the rocket slower okay so let's go

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.069 
make the rocket slower okay so let's go
back<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> change<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:36.079> I'll

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
back for a change go up here I'll

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.450 
back for a change go up here I'll
explain<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.100> did<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.399> a

explain more about what I just did in a
future<00:00:38.730> video<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:41.239> okay<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
future video but for now okay so as you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
future video but for now okay so as you
can<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.140> standard<00:00:43.770> scope<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.280> looks<00:00:44.430> like

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
can see standard scope it looks like

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.610 
can see standard scope it looks like
iron<00:00:45.030> sights<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> big<00:00:47.250> difference

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
iron sights but it has a big difference

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.720 
iron sights but it has a big difference
as<00:00:49.620> long<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.100> holding<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> scope

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
as long as you are holding the scope

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
as long as you are holding the scope
button<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> fire<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.809> could<00:00:51.960> remote

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
button when you fire you could remote

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.090 
button when you fire you could remote
control<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
control it and as you can see that can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.869 
control it and as you can see that can
be<00:00:56.219> useful<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.579> such<00:00:56.940> events<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
be useful for such events as this

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
be useful for such events as this
whoopsie<00:00:59.879> i<00:00:59.910> missed<00:01:00.180> earlier<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.289> didn't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
whoopsie i missed earlier that didn't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.520 
whoopsie i missed earlier that didn't
end<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
end so well so you can also do it like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.899 
end so well so you can also do it like
this<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.640> shoot<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> up

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this if you really want to shoot it up

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
this if you really want to shoot it up
in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> air<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:07.130> boom<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.500> now

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
in the air and then boom you see now

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.640 
in the air and then boom you see now
that<00:01:10.830> benefit<00:01:11.220> tops<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> remote<00:01:11.939> controlled

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
that benefit tops the remote controlled

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.300 
that benefit tops the remote controlled
however<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.640> multiple<00:01:15.530> things<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
controlled in a nutshell don't know what

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.260 
controlled in a nutshell don't know what
happen<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.340> beds<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> salvo<00:01:47.970> let's<00:01:48.180> find

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
happen to the beds of salvo let's find

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.230 
happen to the beds of salvo let's find
out

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.249 

let's<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.420> let<00:01:54.539> them<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.810> load<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> pop<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
let's just let them all load and pop the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.840 
let's just let them all load and pop the
idea<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:58.979> he<00:01:59.070> controlling<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> unique

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
idea is I think he controlling it unique

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.260 
idea is I think he controlling it unique
rockets<00:02:00.329> which<00:02:00.799> hmm<00:02:01.970> can't<00:02:02.970> really<00:02:03.060> confirm

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
rockets which hmm can't really confirm

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
rockets which hmm can't really confirm
what<00:02:03.539> happened<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
what happened there but you get the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.840 
what happened there but you get the
point<00:02:04.740> two<00:02:04.950> remote-controlled<00:02:05.189> lets<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
point two remote-controlled lets you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
point two remote-controlled lets you
move<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.179> rocket<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> any<00:02:06.840> pattern<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
move the rocket in any pattern you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.839 
move the rocket in any pattern you
choose<00:02:09.170> noteworthy<00:02:10.170> thing<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.860> mention<00:02:11.009> it's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
choose noteworthy thing to mention it's

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.759 
choose noteworthy thing to mention it's
awkward<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.269> use<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.720> mortar<00:02:13.140> unlocked

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
awkward to use with mortar unlocked

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.020 
awkward to use with mortar unlocked
because<00:02:14.030> well<00:02:15.200> they<00:02:16.200> obey<00:02:17.130> gravity<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:17.819> will
