wallet<00:00:22.539> cases<00:00:22.750> but<00:00:23.140> I<00:00:23.170> don't<00:00:23.470> like<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.740> kind

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
wallet cases but I don't like the kind

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.519 
wallet cases but I don't like the kind
that<00:00:24.430> flap<00:00:24.760> around<00:00:24.970> because<00:00:25.720> what<00:00:26.050> happens<00:00:26.380> is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
that flap around because what happens is

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.720 
that flap around because what happens is
is<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.980> soon<00:00:27.130> as<00:00:27.220> you<00:00:27.279> turn<00:00:27.430> it<00:00:27.550> back<00:00:27.699> around

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
is that soon as you turn it back around

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.779 
is that soon as you turn it back around
it<00:00:28.720> gets<00:00:28.990> in<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.140> way<00:00:29.289> of<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.470> camera<00:00:29.830> so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
it gets in the way of the camera so

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.140 
it gets in the way of the camera so
these<00:00:31.090> are<00:00:31.150> my<00:00:31.300> preferred<00:00:32.290> style<00:00:32.769> cases<00:00:33.550> where

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
these are my preferred style cases where

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.840 
these are my preferred style cases where
we<00:00:34.360> can<00:00:34.540> actually<00:00:34.750> open<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.589> up<00:00:35.739> on<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.640> back

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
we can actually open it up on the back

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we can actually open it up on the back
without<00:00:37.269> interfering<00:00:38.080> with<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:39.629> camera<00:00:40.629> and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
without interfering with the camera and

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.680 
without interfering with the camera and
let's<00:00:41.290> can<00:00:41.470> fit<00:00:41.559> up<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.710> three<00:00:42.070> cards

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
let's can fit up to three cards

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.000 
let's can fit up to three cards
comfortably<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.320> course<00:00:44.620> this<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> an

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
comfortably and of course this is an

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.500 
comfortably and of course this is an
otterbox<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.909> can<00:00:46.030> take<00:00:46.180> lots<00:00:46.420> of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
otterbox so it can take lots of

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.289 
otterbox so it can take lots of
punishment<00:00:47.110> in<00:00:47.290> terms<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.159> dropping<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:51.299> see

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
punishment in terms of dropping so see

00:00:52.299 --> 00:01:02.520 
punishment in terms of dropping so see

I'm<00:01:05.740> not<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.040> biggest<00:01:06.189> fan<00:01:06.369> of<00:01:06.549> screen

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
I'm not the biggest fan of screen

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.300 
I'm not the biggest fan of screen
protectors<00:01:07.030> but<00:01:07.719> if<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.530> do<00:01:08.740> like<00:01:08.979> them<00:01:09.219> you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
protectors but if you do like them you

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.560 
protectors but if you do like them you
should<00:01:09.340> definitely<00:01:09.700> use<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:11.609> so<00:01:12.609> we<00:01:13.539> shall

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
should definitely use it and so we shall

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.510 
should definitely use it and so we shall
put<00:01:14.079> this<00:01:14.289> in<00:01:14.740> here<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:20.500> if<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:21.100> put<00:01:21.429> it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
put this in here and see if I can put it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:31.010 
put this in here and see if I can put it
easily<00:01:21.969> enough<00:01:22.109> in<00:01:23.109> the<00:01:24.070> case

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.910 

yeah<00:01:32.020> i'll<00:01:32.110> probably<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.500> take<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.800> out

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
yeah i'll probably have to take it out

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.710 
yeah i'll probably have to take it out
but<00:01:33.700> sometimes<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.120> do<00:01:34.240> have<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.420> take<00:01:34.570> out

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
but sometimes you do have to take out

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.090 
but sometimes you do have to take out
just<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> rubber<00:01:35.200> part<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.010> can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
just the rubber part just so you can

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.700 
just the rubber part just so you can
easily<00:01:36.340> put<00:01:36.730> it<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:38.080> easy<00:01:38.260> way<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.530> do

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
easily put it in it's the easy way to do

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.500 
easily put it in it's the easy way to do
it<00:01:38.890> but<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.310> know<00:01:39.430> sometimes<00:01:39.880> people<00:01:40.210> are

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
it but you know sometimes people are

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.850 
it but you know sometimes people are
lazy<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.990> they<00:01:41.140> don't<00:01:41.230> want<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.500> take<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.680> off

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
lazy and they don't want to take it off

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.800 
lazy and they don't want to take it off
so<00:01:42.310> that's<00:01:42.970> why<00:01:43.180> they<00:01:43.270> want<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.510> take<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.630> off

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
so that's why they want to take it off

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.520 
so that's why they want to take it off
and<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:48.690> once<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.990> fit<00:01:50.290> in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
and there we have it and once you fit in

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.970 
and there we have it and once you fit in
properly<00:01:56.160> then<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.760> have<00:01:58.090> your<00:01:58.120> case<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.860> can

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
properly then you have your case you can

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.160 
properly then you have your case you can
see<00:02:00.010> how<00:02:00.280> thick<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.540> back<00:02:01.750> as<00:02:02.140> you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
see how thick it is on the back as you

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.660 
see how thick it is on the back as you
know<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.620> does<00:02:02.800> have<00:02:02.980> to<00:02:03.100> make<00:02:03.250> room<00:02:03.370> through

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
know it does have to make room through

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.540 
know it does have to make room through
the<00:02:03.760> card<00:02:04.060> part<00:02:04.440> obviously<00:02:05.440> this<00:02:06.040> is<00:02:06.250> an<00:02:06.370> otter

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
the card part obviously this is an otter

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.920 
the card part obviously this is an otter
so<00:02:06.850> I'm<00:02:06.970> not<00:02:07.120> really<00:02:07.180> worried<00:02:07.570> about<00:02:07.660> this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
so I'm not really worried about this

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.310 
so I'm not really worried about this
dropping<00:02:08.530> now<00:02:08.710> and<00:02:09.070> then<00:02:09.790> how<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:10.960> push

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.100 
dropping now and then how you just push
it<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:11.980> go<00:02:12.520> right<00:02:12.730> here<00:02:13.060> push<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it is you can go right here push it down

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.660 
it is you can go right here push it down
