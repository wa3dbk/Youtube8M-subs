00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
in parallel universes so they don't

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.039

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
production guy but i think that is

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.380 
production guy but i think that is
pretty<00:04:16.130> reasonable<00:04:16.669> for<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.849> full<00:04:17.120> feature

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
pretty reasonable for a full feature

I don't know if they'll hit that stretch

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.649 
I don't know if they'll hit that stretch
goal<00:04:19.699> because<00:04:19.999> the<00:04:20.090> kickstarter<00:04:20.509> funding
