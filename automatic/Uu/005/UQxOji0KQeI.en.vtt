as I'm going look along these pillars

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.970 
as I'm going look along these pillars
here<00:03:13.480> are<00:03:13.720> these<00:03:13.840> allegis<00:03:15.090> along<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.209> top

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
here are these allegis along the top

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640 
here are these allegis along the top
it's<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.250> grassy<00:03:18.489> area<00:03:18.730> sometimes<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:20.470> the

part of the map this little box here

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.430 
part of the map this little box here
will<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:35.019> them<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:37.030> fly<00:03:37.810> back<00:03:38.049> over<00:03:38.319> this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
will have them and fly back over this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.800 
will have them and fly back over this
way<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.819> make<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.000> basically<00:03:40.390> making<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.630> big

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
way you make it basically making a big

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.900 
way you make it basically making a big
circle<00:03:42.720> come<00:03:43.720> along<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.019> perimeter<00:03:44.380> here

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
circle come along the perimeter here

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.740 
circle come along the perimeter here
come<00:03:45.910> up<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.340> out<00:03:48.640> there's<00:03:49.000> where<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.390> tree

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
come up and out there's where that tree

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.270 
come up and out there's where that tree
is<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:50.140> started<00:03:50.500> right<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.680> here

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
is that we started right on here

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.530 
is that we started right on here
so<00:03:52.000> we're<00:03:52.150> almost<00:03:52.239> done<00:03:52.600> now<00:03:54.120> come<00:03:55.120> along<00:03:55.359> this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
so we're almost done now come along this

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.319 
so we're almost done now come along this
way<00:03:55.600> down<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.109> this<00:03:56.200> area<00:03:57.030> they'll<00:03:58.030> be<00:03:58.150> all

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
way down in this area they'll be all

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.789 
way down in this area they'll be all
along<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> shrubs<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.480> along<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.109> edge<00:04:02.410> I'm

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799
