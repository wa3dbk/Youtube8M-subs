00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.240 
question is is it of any relevant
adoption<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> birth<00:02:17.170> control<00:02:17.590> pills<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
adoption of birth control pills in the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.839 
adoption of birth control pills in the
60s<00:02:19.140> has<00:02:20.140> led<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> large<00:02:21.010> increase<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
60s has led to a large increase in the

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.240 
60s has led to a large increase in the
waterways<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.709> body<00:02:23.920> doesn't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
waterways because the body doesn't

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.949 
waterways because the body doesn't
metabolize<00:02:24.849> all<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.150> them<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:25.510> we'll<00:02:25.720> just

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
metabolize all of them so we'll just

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.720 
metabolize all of them so we'll just
come<00:02:26.110> through<00:02:26.190> virtually<00:02:27.190> every

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
come through virtually every

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.910 
come through virtually every
pharmaceutical<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:29.049> we<00:02:29.230> take<00:02:29.560> into<00:02:29.739> our

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
pharmaceutical that we take into our

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.680 
pharmaceutical that we take into our
body<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.060> released<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.599> our

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
body is going to be released in our

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.589 
body is going to be released in our
urine<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.170> that's<00:02:32.349> why<00:02:32.560> when<00:02:33.540> people<00:02:34.540> are

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
urine so that's why when people are

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.569 
urine so that's why when people are
administered<00:02:35.170> drug<00:02:35.470> tests<00:02:35.890> they<00:02:36.220> collect

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
administered drug tests they collect

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.880 
administered drug tests they collect
urine<00:02:36.760> samples<00:02:37.590> usually<00:02:38.590> somewhere<00:02:38.829> between

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
urine samples usually somewhere between

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.339 
urine samples usually somewhere between
half<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:39.910> seventy-five<00:02:40.780> percent<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
half and seventy-five percent of the

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.069 
half and seventy-five percent of the
drug<00:02:41.530> goes<00:02:41.799> out<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.069> our<00:02:42.160> urine<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> again<00:02:43.870> we

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
drug goes out in our urine so again we

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.130 
drug goes out in our urine so again we
have<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.410> nice<00:02:44.829> centralized<00:02:46.140> collection

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
have this nice centralized collection

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.250 
have this nice centralized collection
system<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:47.650> sewage<00:02:48.010> now<00:02:48.370> our<00:02:48.790> urine<00:02:49.269> usually

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
system for sewage now our urine usually

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
system for sewage now our urine usually
goes<00:02:50.379> down<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> sewer<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.090> all

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
goes down the sewer and so it's all

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.729 
goes down the sewer and so it's all
concentrated<00:02:52.750> etho<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> sore<00:02:53.170> treatment<00:02:53.349> plant

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
concentrated etho a sore treatment plant

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.190 
concentrated etho a sore treatment plant
and<00:02:53.859> then<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.280> go<00:02:54.370> out<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> world

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.059 

hormones<00:03:02.200> are<00:03:02.379> not<00:03:02.530> necessarily

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
hormones are not necessarily

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.000 
hormones are not necessarily
pharmaceuticals<00:03:03.910> those<00:03:04.239> are<00:03:05.010> often

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
pharmaceuticals those are often

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
pharmaceuticals those are often
naturally<00:03:06.459> produced<00:03:06.760> from<00:03:06.910> our<00:03:07.030> bodies<00:03:07.300> so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
naturally produced from our bodies so

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
naturally produced from our bodies so
I'm<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:07.989> release<00:03:08.379> my<00:03:08.650> set<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.010> hormones

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
I'm going to release my set of hormones

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'm going to release my set of hormones
every<00:03:09.640> day<00:03:09.790> I'm<00:03:10.569> not<00:03:10.780> currently<00:03:11.110> taking<00:03:11.500> any

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
every day I'm not currently taking any

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.400 
every day I'm not currently taking any
pharmaceutical<00:03:12.459> compounds<00:03:12.879> at<00:03:12.970> all<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.930> lot<00:03:14.290> of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
pharmaceutical compounds at all a lot of

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.670 
pharmaceutical compounds at all a lot of
women<00:03:14.530> are<00:03:14.769> taking<00:03:15.269> birth<00:03:16.269> control<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.900> so

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
women are taking birth control and so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.270 
women are taking birth control and so
that<00:03:18.640> introduces<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> set<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.140> either<00:03:20.950> high

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that introduces a set of either high

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.339 
that introduces a set of either high
level<00:03:21.610> natural<00:03:21.970> hormones<00:03:22.360> or<00:03:22.660> even

well<00:03:46.540> bacteria<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.019> viruses<00:03:47.409> we<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.709> rid<00:03:47.920> of

well bacteria and viruses we get rid of
