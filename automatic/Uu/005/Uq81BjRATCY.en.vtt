00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
basically is the length of the bar codes

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.110 
basically is the length of the bar codes
that<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.360> use<00:00:44.540> in<00:00:44.750> characters<00:00:45.520> for<00:00:46.520> example

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that you use in characters for example

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.300 
that you use in characters for example
the<00:00:47.600> most<00:00:47.840> common<00:00:48.320> used<00:00:48.560> bar<00:00:48.860> codes<00:00:49.070> have<00:00:49.250> a

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
the most common used bar codes have a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.060 
the most common used bar codes have a
length<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.760> 12<00:00:50.120> characters<00:00:50.540> however<00:00:51.500> barcodes

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
length of 12 characters however barcodes

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.479 
length of 12 characters however barcodes
for<00:00:52.160> books<00:00:52.550> have<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:52.880> length<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.300> 13<00:00:53.899> characters

for books have a length of 13 characters

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.190 
for books have a length of 13 characters
so<00:00:55.489> in<00:00:55.640> here<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.090> need<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.360> put<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> maximum

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
so in here you need to put the maximum

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.170 
so in here you need to put the maximum
length<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.649> characters<00:00:58.190> for<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.760> bar<00:00:58.940> codes

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
length of characters for the bar codes
