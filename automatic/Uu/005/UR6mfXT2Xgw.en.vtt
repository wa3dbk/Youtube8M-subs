 Not a word for the frequency on the page 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.740
 turned cheer and then 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 move the basket for come on now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 looking for this one for yourself while you have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.000
 camera with let's you say what will happen 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.590
 baby because my stuff is not me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 cheap throw out on the street or mini 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 yellows such a turn bailiffs 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 and the police did not expect the room and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 emergency meeting with a representative 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 Directorate of construction has become a nursery 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.930
 bedroom we are all evicted by decision 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 court items that we gave to the child 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.210
 remain here that means citizens 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 comp natalia borisovna with a child 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 it remains to live on there 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 have her evicted but she can be 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 at the place of registration of the child is legal but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 such a decision does not suit already 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.759
 builders because the house remained standing 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.549
 in its place which means the deadline 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.370
 facility again transfer financing 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.470
 dedicated trillion 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.660
 and due to the fact that doom does not mix, we 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.180
 can't start switching networks 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.820
 otherwise, the stations are digging normally 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.010
 railway station month number somewhere 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.290
 17 billion rubles for this house in 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.210
 The directors are sure the issue is resolved in all 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.520
 rules instead of a dilapidated house on 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.190
 sixty two square meters new 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.410
 treshka 15 meters more to agree 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.720
 tenants no other compensation options 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.480
 there was a possibility they did not appear not on 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.700
 one meeting the owners parry them 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.890
 did not properly notify the wad 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.420
 decided spouses project manager in 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.730
 a large international company and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.860
 travel company director not to go on 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.740
 compromise in a dispute over this house and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.020
 point out errors in the judgment 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.160
 execution of the decision cannot be made 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.720
 this must be notified 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.480
 relevant judicial service 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.230
 performers for taking some 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.330
 another solution because if all individuals 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.140
 who take care of the child will 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.270
 evicted 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.270
 minor child will age 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.760
 four months completely alone then we 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.480
 we have an offense composition remaining in 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.730
 danger 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.830
 and here is another fact that set in 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.630
 the court ruling ministry 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.650
 forthcoming seizure of land 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.690
 It was adopted on March 22, 2012 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.860
 his wife did not register for 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.770
 this address is May 30, 2012 ie 70 days 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 later, Brela Breit assures it is simple 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.510
 coincidence demolition notice not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.690
 received if the spouse was 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.300
 registered after the decision 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.790
 about seizure of land then 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.650
 Naturally she does not qualify for 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.070
 extra living space since on 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.030
 the time of seizure was not actually in 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.819
 given 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.209
 but to us the living room however the date 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.580
 the decision is often not the same 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.560
 with the date of notification of the removal 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.870
 solutions to the question still remains 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.370
 open why spouse only later 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.470
 eight years of marriage decided 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.650
 register in this house which 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.459
 from day to day can take down know the case 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.950
 in the fact that he we long raised this 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.150
 question about registration of course were 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:12.470
 little pitfalls in the plan and 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.630
 the parents were somehow not quite 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.060
 ready to register me because for them 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.709
 I am naturally a stranger ambiguous 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.840
 by the way and the story itself of one of 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.570
 Owners for whom the spouse of the son 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.970
 and the mother of grandchildren alien man builders 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.250
 assure neighbors already accustomed to 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.860
 grandfather who today according to the family 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.690
 allegedly was at work for half a year did not see 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.000
 never anything patterns grandfather grandfather 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.520
 we have never seen according to spouse in 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.380
 they have no other property 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.389
 they never gave official consent 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.860
 to move and new apartment in 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.800
 property is not issued 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.690
 legally evicted to nowhere I confused 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.700
 to the attorney general's office supervisory 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.290
 the complaint and now the attorney general's office 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.840
 must decide on the prevailing 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.210
 Situations for now this family will live on 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.550
 two houses are already joking are going to go 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.860
 one to one and children visit as 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.720
 for a long time this litigation will be delayed and what 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.030
 the solution will suit all participants 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.919
 conflict most likely the question will be 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.020
 decide the supreme court and the general 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.300
