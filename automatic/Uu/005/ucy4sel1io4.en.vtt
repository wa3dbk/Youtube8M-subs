themselves<00:00:12.090> now<00:00:12.929> you'll<00:00:13.049> notice<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.380> these

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
themselves now you'll notice that these

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.110 
themselves now you'll notice that these
animals<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:14.070> very<00:00:14.340> unique<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.790> well<00:00:14.969> adapted

animals are very unique and well adapted

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.050 
animals are very unique and well adapted
to<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.839> ice<00:00:16.080> by<00:00:16.590> looking<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.160> their<00:00:17.609> backs

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
to this ice by looking at their backs

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.420 
to this ice by looking at their backs
now<00:00:18.900> you'll<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.320> their<00:00:19.650> backs<00:00:19.980> are

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
now you'll see that their backs are

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.650 
now you'll see that their backs are
missing<00:00:20.760> something<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> other<00:00:21.420> green

atmosphere to keep the planet at a
hospitable<00:00:53.520> temperature<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.719> lose<00:00:55.520> energy

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
hospitable temperature as we lose energy

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.330 
hospitable temperature as we lose energy
we<00:00:57.390> start<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> put<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.199> carbon<00:00:58.469> dioxide<00:00:59.100> into

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
we start to put more carbon dioxide into

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.069 
we start to put more carbon dioxide into
that<00:00:59.520> atmosphere<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.329> thickening<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that atmosphere and we're thickening the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.640 
that atmosphere and we're thickening the
layer<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.739> gas<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.789> stopping<00:01:03.270> heat<00:01:04.229> from

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
layer of gas which is stopping heat from

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
layer of gas which is stopping heat from
getting<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.430> heat<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> basically<00:01:06.119> getting

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
getting out so heat is basically getting

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
getting out so heat is basically getting
trapped<00:01:06.750> between<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.170> planet<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
trapped between the planet and the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
trapped between the planet and the
atmosphere<00:01:08.340> oh<00:01:08.369> yeah<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.990> guys<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.200> really

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
atmosphere oh yeah you guys have really

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
atmosphere oh yeah you guys have really
flexible<00:01:10.979> bits<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> ability<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
flexible bits so we have the ability to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
flexible bits so we have the ability to
spit<00:01:12.630> water<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.830> think

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
spit water and what we're gonna think

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
spit water and what we're gonna think
hopefully<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.670> Aurora<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.360> spit<00:01:15.659> some

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
hopefully is Aurora is gonna spit some

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
hopefully is Aurora is gonna spit some
water<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.890> front<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.369> our<00:01:17.640> lovely

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
water right up front at our lovely

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.210 
water right up front at our lovely
trainer<00:01:18.299> Ida<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:18.990> there

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.920 

now<00:01:24.760> as<00:01:24.940> she<00:01:25.090> swims<00:01:25.270> around<00:01:25.480> you<00:01:25.690> guys<00:01:25.780> are

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
now as she swims around you guys are

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.840 
now as she swims around you guys are
gonna<00:01:26.020> get<00:01:26.290> pretty<00:01:26.800> good<00:01:27.100> look<00:01:27.310> at<00:01:27.430> how<00:01:27.670> much

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
gonna get pretty good look at how much

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.430 
gonna get pretty good look at how much
water<00:01:28.030> comes<00:01:28.360> out<00:01:28.510> of<00:01:28.600> her<00:01:28.690> mouth<00:01:28.720> these<00:01:29.200> guys

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
water comes out of her mouth these guys

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.020 
water comes out of her mouth these guys
can<00:01:29.620> hold<00:01:29.770> up<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.040> gallon<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.640> water<00:01:30.820> in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
can hold up to a gallon of water in

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:46.480 
can hold up to a gallon of water in
their<00:01:31.150> mouth<00:01:31.300> at<00:01:31.480> a<00:01:31.540> time

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.010 

that<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.640> fantastic<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.570> give<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> round<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that was fantastic it's give a round of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.590 
that was fantastic it's give a round of
applause<00:01:49.260> for<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:49.980> certainty

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.210 

they<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> great<00:01:55.110> opportunity<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.860> feed

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
they have a great opportunity to feed

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.770 
they have a great opportunity to feed
off<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.610> animals<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.330> are<00:01:57.450> under<00:01:57.660> the
