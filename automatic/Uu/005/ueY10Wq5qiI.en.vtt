00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 I will show you how to check 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.550
 health status basically two discs 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 hard for that there are many ways of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.250
 do it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.820
 so me today I'm going to you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.800
 present the simplest so in fact 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.060
 right click on the disc what you want 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:39.180
 so check me it's going to be helping him these 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.790
 properties have made tools check 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:50.360
 now around 14h time this option 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:53.310
 of the movie we check now that it came 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.010
 prepare thematically the errors of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.690
 system and yes I was looking at 100-120 of 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.450
 recovery a recovery of the sector 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.180
 faulty so who did start and 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 see but it will be quickly I believe 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:19.649
 so basically his daughter-in-law the Baltic 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.579
 sector came from disk 2 so that 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:27.929
 that will tell us ah end of the test the disc 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.299
 hard is acceptable or not 3.2 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.619
 sector that can be accepted but this 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.350
 which is to be taken into account although we have 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
 earth batiks is that disks 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.219
 hard will write on our bottom of seven 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.159
 years we will lose this part gave 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:46.829
 so so riots have for example 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 I record a video and I fall on 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 the bottom of the sector he takes a part of 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.859
 the video that will be little will not be leezam 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.709
 by the computer so the video 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:03.299
 will not walk things like that it can 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:06.600
 come up with the sector debate so here is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.399
 all I have to say to you so at most 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.690
 late 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.740
 hello everyone so here we go again 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.160
 for this second part so the test 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.070
 just ended and basically they 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.050
 say that my hard drive was analyzed 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.600
 that there is no problem it is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:31.290
 sometimes you have taken a little 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.060
 does okay so says that my hard 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.520
 isolated wholesale wholesale that all check 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.610
 that everything is perfect it gives you a 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.610
 list of what is made in euros so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.610
 this is already integrated in the windows 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.310
 so is very easy to do would be 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.850
 windows 7 is a leaf and also takes 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.010
 windows 8 it's all the same thing on 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.660
 xp I think it's different but I 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.000
 could I not venture into 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.959
 something I do not know so 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.269
 this is it 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.000
 and do not forget to subscribe to 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.000
 thing for more videos and goodbye
