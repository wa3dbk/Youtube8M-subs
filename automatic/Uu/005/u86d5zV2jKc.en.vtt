this on your own you're going to go much
more<00:01:20.280> slowly<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.970> did<00:01:21.259> again<00:01:22.259> spend<00:01:22.530> five

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
more slowly than I did again spend five

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
more slowly than I did again spend five
to<00:01:22.830> ten<00:01:23.009> seconds<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.490> each<00:01:23.580> hot<00:01:23.820> spot<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to ten seconds on each hot spot and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
to ten seconds on each hot spot and
continue<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> t<00:01:25.979> pans<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> great<00:01:26.610> area

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
continue on so I t pans a great area

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
continue on so I t pans a great area
quite<00:01:27.509> often<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.049> knots<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.650> our<00:01:28.770> glutes

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
quite often we have knots in our glutes

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
quite often we have knots in our glutes
too<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> foam<00:01:30.570> berwyn<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
too so you can use the foam berwyn for

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.460 
too so you can use the foam berwyn for
that<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> sit<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> roll<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.290> let's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that so you to sit on a roll up let's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
that so you to sit on a roll up let's
say<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.040> glue<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> turn<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
say I do my right glue I turn to the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
say I do my right glue I turn to the
side<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.320> always<00:01:37.470> helps<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.860> put<00:01:38.070> your

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
side and it always helps to put your

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
side and it always helps to put your
muscle<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.970> stretch<00:01:39.360> by<00:01:40.049> crossing<00:01:40.409> my<00:01:40.710> knee

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
muscle on stretch by crossing my knee

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.950 
muscle on stretch by crossing my knee
over<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.460> ankle<00:01:41.909> over<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.240> knee<00:01:42.299> my

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
over and my ankle over to my knee my

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
over and my ankle over to my knee my
glutes<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.470> under<00:01:43.710> stretch<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
glutes now under stretch and I get a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
glutes now under stretch and I get a
little<00:01:44.790> deeper<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> soft<00:01:46.079> tissue<00:01:46.229> work<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
little deeper a soft tissue work here to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
little deeper a soft tissue work here to
get<00:01:46.920> more<00:01:47.009> knots<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.540> roll<00:01:48.899> around

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
get more knots out and just roll around

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
get more knots out and just roll around
you<00:01:49.320> find<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> type<00:01:49.829> sensitive<00:01:50.399> areas<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you find the type sensitive areas and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
you find the type sensitive areas and
again<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.600> been<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:51.899> time

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
again it's been some time

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.930 
again it's been some time
and<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.650> areas<00:01:53.160> that<00:01:53.250> hurt<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.400> most<00:01:53.520> spend

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and that areas that hurt the most spend

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.480 
and that areas that hurt the most spend
a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.180> time<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:54.540> area<00:01:55.250> okay<00:01:56.250> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
a little more time in that area okay so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
a little more time in that area okay so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.450 
have plantar fasciitis or at least knots
and<00:02:09.240> our<00:02:09.330> feet<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.780> end<00:02:09.930> up<00:02:10.050> affecting<00:02:10.830> our

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
and our feet that end up affecting our

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.070 
and our feet that end up affecting our
body<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.940> further<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> kinetic<00:02:12.840> change

body up further up the kinetic change

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.410 
body up further up the kinetic change
chain<00:02:13.710> which<00:02:14.310> could<00:02:14.520> cause<00:02:14.730> problems<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
chain which could cause problems if you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.700 
chain which could cause problems if you
think<00:02:15.630> about<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.900> every<00:02:16.290> step<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.680> take

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
think about it every step we take

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.860 
think about it every step we take
involve<00:02:17.700> our<00:02:17.850> feet<00:02:18.030> obviously<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.810> our

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
involve our feet obviously so if our

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.360 
involve our feet obviously so if our
feet<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.140> knots<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.710> that's<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
feet have knots in it that's going to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.010 
feet have knots in it that's going to
eventually<00:02:20.550> lead<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.910> maybe<00:02:21.120> knee<00:02:21.360> hip<00:02:21.750> low

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
eventually lead to maybe knee hip low

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.780 
eventually lead to maybe knee hip low
back<00:02:22.230> problems<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.460> hold<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
back problems so you just hold on to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.830 
back problems so you just hold on to
something<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.060> balance<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:24.720> I'm

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
something for balance right now I'm

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.110 
something for balance right now I'm
using<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.230> roller<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.430> use<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> wall<00:02:26.850> for

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
using a roller you can use a wall for

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.270 
using a roller you can use a wall for
whatever<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.540> nice<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.840> sturdy<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.350> then

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
whatever it's nice and sturdy and then

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.980 
whatever it's nice and sturdy and then

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
along the foot from basically the arch

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.260 
along the foot from basically the arch
of<00:02:34.380> your<00:02:34.500> heel<00:02:35.430> I'll<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:35.820> you're<00:02:35.970> just

of your foot ok so do both feet and
another<00:02:44.430> 1<00:02:44.640> i'm<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.940> show<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
another 1 i'm going to show you is the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.470 
another 1 i'm going to show you is the
glutes<00:02:46.740> with<00:02:46.920> lacrosse<00:02:47.190> ball<00:02:47.520> sometimes<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
glutes with lacrosse ball sometimes the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
glutes with lacrosse ball sometimes the
foam<00:02:48.690> roller<00:02:48.959> once<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> get<00:02:49.440> used<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.800> you

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
foam roller once you get used to it you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.699 
foam roller once you get used to it you
can't<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.640> feel<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.120> nuts<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.530> nuts

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
can't really feel the nuts in the nuts

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.199 
can't really feel the nuts in the nuts
out<00:02:52.890> because<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.370> too<00:02:53.520> big<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.820> cumbersome

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
out because it's too big and cumbersome

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.090 
out because it's too big and cumbersome
so<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> use<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.290> lacrosse<00:02:55.590> ball<00:02:55.830> indoor

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100

tennis squat for that as well same thing

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.670 
tennis squat for that as well same thing
and<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.310> find<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.670> hot<00:02:59.820> spot<00:03:00.200> roll<00:03:01.200> around<00:03:01.320> on

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
and just find a hot spot roll around on

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.410 
and just find a hot spot roll around on
it<00:03:01.739> now<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:02.760> sensitive<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it now this one is so sensitive that you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.760 
it now this one is so sensitive that you
may<00:03:03.540> not<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.110> cross<00:03:04.350> your<00:03:04.530> foot<00:03:04.680> over

may not need to cross your foot over

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.530 
may not need to cross your foot over
like<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> cuz<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.370> pretty<00:03:05.580> painful<00:03:05.730> but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
like that cuz it's pretty painful but

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.030 
like that cuz it's pretty painful but
that's<00:03:07.170> something<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> if<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> want
