00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
said about this bigger power bank here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
said about this bigger power bank here
sure<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.930> bigger<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.890> battery

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
sure the bigger one has more battery
