00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.550 
stuck with you know where can we go
we've<00:04:18.060> got<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> use<00:04:18.449> them<00:04:18.690> because<00:04:19.260> they're

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
we've got to use them because they're

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.620 
we've got to use them because they're
iconic<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.340> where<00:04:20.579> can<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:20.790> take<00:04:21.000> them<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.389> so

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
iconic and where can we take them and so

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.730 
iconic and where can we take them and so
it's<00:04:22.049> gone<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.440> an<00:04:23.160> interesting<00:04:23.850> direction

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
it's gone in a an interesting direction

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.219 
it's gone in a an interesting direction
I<00:04:25.740> think<00:04:26.550> some<00:04:26.790> people<00:04:27.150> might<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.630> enjoy<00:04:27.960> it

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
I think some people might not enjoy it

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.510 
I think some people might not enjoy it
because<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.070> little<00:04:29.370> bit<00:04:29.550> hokey<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:31.520> you

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
because is a little bit hokey but you

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.550 
because is a little bit hokey but you
know<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.669> thought<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.030> was<00:04:33.150> no<00:04:33.720> thought<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.470> was

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
know I thought it was no thought it was

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.580 
know I thought it was no thought it was
a<00:04:34.590> nice<00:04:34.830> rump<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:36.020> Capaldi<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.050> absolutely

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
a nice rump and Capaldi is absolutely

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.230 
a nice rump and Capaldi is absolutely
magnetic<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.310> watch<00:04:38.520> right<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:38.790> thought<00:04:39.030> he<00:04:39.120> was

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
magnetic to watch right I thought he was

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.550 
magnetic to watch right I thought he was
really<00:04:39.479> very<00:04:39.750> good<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:41.600> so<00:04:42.600> yeah<00:04:42.840> hopefully

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
really very good in it so yeah hopefully

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.510 
really very good in it so yeah hopefully
that<00:04:43.889> isn't<00:04:44.160> sport<00:04:44.520> your<00:04:44.700> enjoyment<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:46.520> think
