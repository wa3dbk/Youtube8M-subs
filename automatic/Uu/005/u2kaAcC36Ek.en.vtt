 this agreement to morocco 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 despite accepting their proposals 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 because let's go let's help 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
 but everyone sees this 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 if there is a majority 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420

 to see if the judge will see who it is if this condition is the Mexicans is 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.299
 the name and another one is already the human characterization as it is part of

 the same 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
