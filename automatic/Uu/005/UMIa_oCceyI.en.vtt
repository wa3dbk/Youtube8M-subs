right now we've got two player co-op set

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.179 
right now we've got two player co-op set
up<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:18.199> they're<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.410> cycling<00:00:19.560> through<00:00:19.920> some

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
up and they're just cycling through some

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.710 
up and they're just cycling through some
different<00:00:20.430> different<00:00:21.240> equipment<00:00:21.449> options

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different different equipment options

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.900 
different different equipment options
different<00:00:22.140> characters<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.789> they

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
different characters and I think they

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.710 
different characters and I think they
they're<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.480> ready<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.779> go<00:00:29.480> all<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.570> so

showing four packs as well this is a sea
of<00:00:34.590> sand<00:00:34.890> level<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> occurs

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of sand level it's kind of occurs

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
of sand level it's kind of occurs
somewhat<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> middle<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> campaign

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
somewhat in the middle of the campaign

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
somewhat in the middle of the campaign
it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.309> environment<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:42.030> all

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it's a different environment it's all

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
new so one thing too I think to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
new so one thing too I think to
emphasize<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> crimson<00:00:48.899> alliance<00:00:49.170> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
emphasize just a crimson alliance in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709

general<00:00:49.559> where<00:00:49.770> action<00:00:50.070> RPG<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.180> we're

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
general where action RPG but we're

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.189 
general where action RPG but we're
definitely<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.199> action<00:00:53.840> we<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> keep

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
definitely more action we want to keep

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.920 
definitely more action we want to keep
things<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.710> fast<00:00:56.550> pace<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.539> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
things very fast pace we're kind of the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
things very fast pace we're kind of the
pick<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> play<00:00:58.469> RPG<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.120> PG

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
pick up and play RPG we have our PG

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
pick up and play RPG we have our PG
elements<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.800> very

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
elements but you know it's very

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
elements but you know it's very
streamlined<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
streamlined it's kind of you know the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
streamlined it's kind of you know the
xbox<00:01:03.899> live<00:01:04.049> arcade<00:01:04.229> space<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
xbox live arcade space I think kind of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
xbox live arcade space I think kind of
suits<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.260> jump<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.740> play<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
suits that kind of jump in play for a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
suits that kind of jump in play for a
bit<00:01:08.369> jump<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.909> tiled<00:01:09.450> gameplay<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.310> you'll

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
bit jump out tiled gameplay so you'll

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
bit jump out tiled gameplay so you'll
see<00:01:11.460> various<00:01:11.729> things<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> game<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.299> kind

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
see various things in the game that kind

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of support that that that principle

development<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.220> we're<00:04:04.340> working<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.670> halo

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
development and we're working on halo

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.759 
development and we're working on halo
anniversary<00:04:05.180> you've<00:04:06.049> repulsive<00:04:06.470> worked<00:04:06.590> on

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
cod and other halo maps so I think for

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.650 
cod and other halo maps so I think for
the<00:04:10.430> game<00:04:10.580> overall<00:04:10.849> we're<00:04:11.209> kind<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.420> drawing

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
the game overall we're kind of drawing

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.080 
the game overall we're kind of drawing
from<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:11.989> experience<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:13.579> creating<00:04:14.030> a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
from that experience and and creating a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.610 
from that experience and and creating a
lot<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.299> encounters<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.959> have<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.470> think

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
lot of encounters that you have to think

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.930 
lot of encounters that you have to think
about<00:04:15.709> tactically<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:19.280> can<00:04:19.400> charge<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:19.820> there

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
about tactically you can charge in there

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.750 
about tactically you can charge in there
and<00:04:20.120> just<00:04:20.239> start<00:04:20.510> wailing<00:04:20.780> away<00:04:20.870> but<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:22.639> know

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
and just start wailing away but you know

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.430 
and just start wailing away but you know
nine<00:04:22.940> times<00:04:22.970> out<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.360> ten<00:04:23.479> you're<00:04:24.229> probably

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
nine times out of ten you're probably

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.140 
nine times out of ten you're probably
not<00:04:24.620> going<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.770> prayer<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.130> great<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:25.880> want

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
not going to prayer so great so I want

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.900 
not going to prayer so great so I want
people<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.560> really<00:04:27.560> appreciate<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.639> space

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
people to really appreciate the space

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.680 
people to really appreciate the space
and<00:04:29.240> kind<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.570> size<00:04:29.780> things<00:04:30.050> up<00:04:30.200> they<00:04:31.040> may<00:04:31.070> see

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
and kind of size things up they may see

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.909 
and kind of size things up they may see
there<00:04:32.690> might<00:04:32.810> be<00:04:32.840> some<00:04:33.050> strategy<00:04:33.470> there<00:04:33.620> like

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
there might be some strategy there like

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.730 
there might be some strategy there like
you<00:04:34.370> know<00:04:34.490> taking<00:04:34.729> out<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.300> shaman<00:04:36.229> first<00:04:36.470> and

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
not letting him throw bubble shields on

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.080 
not letting him throw bubble shields on
guys<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:40.130> found<00:04:40.280> another<00:04:40.430> secret<00:04:40.820> area

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
guys they found another secret area

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.060 
guys they found another secret area
right<00:04:41.270> here<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:42.500> there's<00:04:42.860> actually<00:04:43.160> five<00:04:43.310> more

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
right here so there's actually five more

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.110 
right here so there's actually five more
another<00:04:46.070> big<00:04:46.250> feature<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.700> game<00:04:46.880> in<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
another big feature of the game in the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.060 
another big feature of the game in the
upper<00:04:47.360> right<00:04:47.539> hand<00:04:47.630> corner<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.650> score

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
upper right hand corner is the the score

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.950 
upper right hand corner is the the score
so<00:04:49.580> everything<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.120> do<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.450> game<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.870> get

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
so everything you do in the game you get

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.750 
so everything you do in the game you get
stored<00:04:51.350> kill<00:04:51.710> guys<00:04:51.889> get<00:04:52.190> school<00:04:52.400> or<00:04:52.550> find

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
stored kill guys get school or find

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.610 
stored kill guys get school or find
secret<00:04:53.000> areas<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.330> can<00:04:53.419> get<00:04:53.539> score<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.169> that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
secret areas you can get score and that

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.230 
secret areas you can get score and that
factors<00:04:54.979> into<00:04:55.160> your<00:04:55.310> overall<00:04:55.610> leaderboard

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
factors into your overall leaderboard

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.089 
factors into your overall leaderboard
ranking<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:59.150> it's<00:04:59.539> as<00:05:00.020> long<00:05:00.710> as<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:00.950> keep

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
ranking so it's as long as I keep

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.500 
ranking so it's as long as I keep
killing<00:05:01.400> guys<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.880> they<00:05:01.940> don't<00:05:02.060> take<00:05:02.240> damage

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
killing guys and they don't take damage

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.629 
killing guys and they don't take damage
there's<00:05:03.470> score<00:05:03.770> multiplier<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:04.460> going<00:05:04.580> to

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
there's score multiplier it's going to

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.339 
there's score multiplier it's going to
keep<00:05:04.820> picking<00:05:05.510> up<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.870> right<00:05:05.990> now<00:05:06.020> they<00:05:06.200> have<00:05:06.289> a

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
keep picking up to right now they have a

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.100 
keep picking up to right now they have a
3x<00:05:06.770> if<00:05:07.580> they<00:05:07.789> keep<00:05:07.970> as<00:05:08.660> long<00:05:08.870> as<00:05:08.960> they<00:05:09.020> don't

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
3x if they keep as long as they don't

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.560 
3x if they keep as long as they don't
get<00:05:09.289> hit<00:05:09.470> that's<00:05:10.310> going<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.520> go<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.639> 4x<00:05:11.060> all<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
get hit that's going to go to 4x all the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.440 
get hit that's going to go to 4x all the
way<00:05:11.630> up<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.750> buy<00:05:11.960> up<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.560> 8x<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.340> now<00:05:14.240> they're

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
way up to buy up to 8x and now they're

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.200 
way up to buy up to 8x and now they're
down<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.720> zero<00:05:14.960> because<00:05:15.520> they<00:05:16.520> just<00:05:16.669> they<00:05:17.180> just

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
down to zero because they just they just

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.060 
down to zero because they just they just
discovered<00:05:17.599> that<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.200> gunner<00:05:18.470> character

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
discovered that the gunner character

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:29.660 
discovered that the gunner character
which<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.729> he's<00:05:20.060> pretty<00:05:20.330> brutal

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.670 

so<00:05:30.670> this<00:05:30.850> is<00:05:31.000> an<00:05:31.120> example<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.990> class<00:05:32.320> door

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
so this is an example of a class door

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.670 
so this is an example of a class door
it's<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.460> class<00:05:33.670> secret<00:05:34.060> door<00:05:34.240> there's<00:05:35.140> one<00:05:35.530> of

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
it's a class secret door there's one of

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.440 
it's a class secret door there's one of
those<00:05:35.890> for<00:05:36.190> every<00:05:36.490> character<00:05:36.670> class<00:05:37.060> per

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
those for every character class per

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.870 
those for every character class per
level<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:38.800> it's<00:05:39.130> something<00:05:39.310> it's<00:05:39.700> always

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
level so it's something it's always

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.150 
level so it's something it's always
something<00:05:40.240> iconic<00:05:40.650> for<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.740> assassin

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
something iconic for the assassin

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.010 
something iconic for the assassin
character<00:05:42.550> it's<00:05:42.790> kind<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.150> gear<00:05:43.630> image

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
character it's kind of that gear image

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.720 
character it's kind of that gear image
that<00:05:44.290> shows<00:05:44.320> up<00:05:44.620> on<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.770> wall<00:05:44.980> where<00:05:45.700> the

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
that shows up on a wall where the

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.700 
that shows up on a wall where the
fighter<00:05:45.970> it's<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.300> cracked<00:05:46.570> wall<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.170> they<00:05:47.560> can

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
fighter it's a cracked wall and they can

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.370 
fighter it's a cracked wall and they can
interact<00:05:47.830> with<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.430> wall<00:05:48.700> and<00:05:49.140> then<00:05:50.140> behind

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
interact with that wall and then behind

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.140 
interact with that wall and then behind
which<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.800> always<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.130> piece<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.400> equipment<00:05:51.610> and

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
which is always a piece of equipment and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.000 
which is always a piece of equipment and
it's<00:05:52.330> it's<00:05:52.900> always<00:05:53.260> better<00:05:53.470> than<00:05:53.770> what<00:05:53.890> you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
it's it's always better than what you

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:02.010 
it's it's always better than what you
already<00:05:54.130> have<00:05:59.460> so<00:06:00.460> at<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.730> end<00:06:00.760> of<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.240> at<00:06:01.720> the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
already have so at the end of a at the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.310 
already have so at the end of a at the
end<00:06:02.170> of<00:06:02.320> play<00:06:02.670> there's<00:06:03.670> basically<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.900> level

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
end of play there's basically the level

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.170 
end of play there's basically the level
score<00:06:05.530> ranking<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.130> it's<00:06:06.490> broken<00:06:06.700> up<00:06:06.910> by

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
score ranking and it's broken up by

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.550 
score ranking and it's broken up by
combat<00:06:08.170> secret<00:06:08.560> areas<00:06:08.860> in<00:06:09.010> time<00:06:09.250> so<00:06:10.090> right<00:06:10.270> now

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
combat secret areas in time so right now

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.110 
combat secret areas in time so right now
they<00:06:11.560> did<00:06:11.770> okay<00:06:12.070> for<00:06:12.100> combat<00:06:12.730> you<00:06:13.000> know<00:06:13.090> I

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
they did okay for combat you know I

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.970 
they did okay for combat you know I
think<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.570> multiplier<00:06:14.500> was<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.680> little<00:06:14.890> bit

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
think the multiplier was a little bit

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.420 
think the multiplier was a little bit
low<00:06:15.160> they<00:06:16.090> only<00:06:16.210> found<00:06:16.420> two<00:06:16.570> out<00:06:16.780> of<00:06:16.810> seven

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
low they only found two out of seven

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.800 
low they only found two out of seven
secret<00:06:18.430> areas<00:06:18.730> so<00:06:18.940> they<00:06:18.970> apply<00:06:19.270> more<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.630> find

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
secret areas so they apply more to find

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.360 
secret areas so they apply more to find
so<00:06:20.170> they're<00:06:20.500> getting<00:06:20.680> points<00:06:20.980> for<00:06:21.100> each<00:06:21.190> one

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
so they're getting points for each one

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.970 
so they're getting points for each one
of<00:06:21.400> those<00:06:21.610> so<00:06:22.150> that<00:06:22.180> overall<00:06:22.750> score<00:06:23.200> is<00:06:23.680> shared

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
of those so that overall score is shared

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.650 
of those so that overall score is shared
between<00:06:24.070> them<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.850> that's<00:06:25.060> posted<00:06:25.450> to<00:06:25.570> the

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
between them and that's posted to the

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.080 
between them and that's posted to the
leaderboards
