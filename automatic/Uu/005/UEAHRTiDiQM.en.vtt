so I think that's the first thing second
thing<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.779> were<00:00:24.900> shit<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.340> half

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

was fucking awful man it was so bad at
it<00:00:28.920> again<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> same<00:00:30.000> problems<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.330> had

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it again it's the same problems we had

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.490 
it again it's the same problems we had
one<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.689> starting<00:00:30.990> lineup<00:00:31.230> come<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
one that starting lineup come out I

one that starting lineup come out I
looked<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.859> thought<00:00:32.009> where's<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> woods

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

coming from we had DeMaria Valencia and
a<00:00:35.550> half<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> criticize<00:00:36.989> him<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> half

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a half on a criticize him and a half

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
a half on a criticize him and a half
filled<00:00:37.890> ring<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.460> every<00:00:38.760> time<00:00:38.790> he<00:00:39.000> gets

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
filled ring because every time he gets

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 
filled ring because every time he gets
that<00:00:39.300> ball<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.200> hand

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that ball and it's on the right hand

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
that ball and it's on the right hand
side<00:00:40.410> there's<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.219> either<00:00:41.730> picking<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> up

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
side there's no one either picking it up

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
side there's no one either picking it up
off<00:00:42.450> him<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.079> overlap<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:44.340> maybe

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
off him so it can overlap I'm at maybe

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
off him so it can overlap I'm at maybe
once<00:00:45.120> twice<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> second<00:00:45.960> half<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.230> even

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
once twice in the second half but even

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
once twice in the second half but even
then<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.739> seem<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.399> both<00:00:47.820> sides<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
then we seem to have on both sides this

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.690 
then we seem to have on both sides this
aversion<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.930> overlay<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> ball<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
aversion to overlay in the ball and it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.330 
aversion to overlay in the ball and it's
easy<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.420> everyone<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.530> 23<00:00:53.010> seconds

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
easy we can everyone can see 23 seconds

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
easy we can everyone can see 23 seconds

heart turn the only person I saw doing

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
heart turn the only person I saw doing
it<00:01:16.860> Rooney<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.390> played<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.659> top<00:01:18.990> today<00:01:19.170> and

it didn't deliver for me I think the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.780 
it didn't deliver for me I think the
first<00:01:22.110> first<00:01:22.590> half<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.520> probably

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
first first half actually was probably

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
first first half actually was probably
his<00:01:23.939> best<00:01:24.060> stuff<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.570> thought<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> movement

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
his best stuff I thought the movement

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
his best stuff I thought the movement
that<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.270> decent<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that was there it was it was decent the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
that was there it was it was decent the
couple<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> runs<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> HUDs<00:01:29.009> were<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> only

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
couple of runs that HUDs were the only

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
couple of runs that HUDs were the only
ones<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.090> soaring<00:01:30.329> behind<00:01:30.659> first<00:01:31.170> half

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ones that are soaring behind first half

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
ones that are soaring behind first half
we<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.250> through<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.820> next<00:01:32.909> round<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.689> have

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we are through to the next round we have

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
we are through to the next round we have
got<00:01:33.990> arsenal<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> Arsenal

got arsenal we have can we be Arsenal
and<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> care<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.979> affects<00:01:38.310> our<00:01:38.460> league

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and do you care if it affects our league

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
and do you care if it affects our league
performance<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
performance if we go all the way in a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
performance if we go all the way in a
cup<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.640> year<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.240> care<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.530> affects<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
cup this year I care if it affects the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
cup this year I care if it affects the
lead<00:01:44.130> performance<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.149> need<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> get

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lead performance I think we need to get

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
lead performance I think we need to get
top<00:01:45.720> four<00:01:45.930> I'm<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.380> too<00:01:46.829> bothered

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

about<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> actual<00:01:47.729> I'm<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.450> too<00:01:48.659> worried

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
about the actual I'm not too worried

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
about the actual I'm not too worried
about<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> actual<00:01:49.320> performances<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
about the actual performances in the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
about the actual performances in the
league<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.960> need<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.380> fourth

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
league but if we need to get fourth

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
league but if we need to get fourth
that's<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> prior<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.640> care<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> FA

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
