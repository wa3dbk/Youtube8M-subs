00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi guys i believe people don't 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.179
 want to understand what the pronunciation is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.040
 important not in English in all 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.830
 languages 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120
 we speak a guard of English 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 let's imagine which are the two or three 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 mistakes that can come to mind 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.410
 regarding how the average Italian 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.660
 pronounce English the word answer o 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.080
 answer in English 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 answers answers when clearly 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 he would be hans in american or i still see 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.820
 because we have not yet understood that from 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 you we don't wind the window or yet 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 a in writing famous single wings I'm in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.969
 writing a letter I have still seen but 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.180
 the whistles to trust first and I'm not 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.730
 talking about my ear and then how 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.390
 say the Americans but of the year of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.739
 this year, or the boys and now we 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 are some people that I just don't 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.530
 I stand those who accuse me or not, in any case 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.570
 people like me that we fans of children 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.360
 to teach by pressing a lot on 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 pronunciation but simply me as a few 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240
 other people try to put in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.759
 light the fact that the pronunciation is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 basic in a language and here we are not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.140
 speaking of accent attention because there 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 maybe they want years for a little linguist 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 professional to lose your own 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 Tuscan Bolognese accent in Milan 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.939
 Roman Friulano any accent 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 thus acquiring a closer accent 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.049
 possible to a British Scottish a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 an Australian American 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.159
 then the African and those who have the most, then put it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.950
 we all know there are foreign people 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.930
 in any nationality that speak 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.040
 maybe very often Italian 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 but then they don't have it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.500
 completely lost but we are talking 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.329
 the pronunciation is 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.579
 I was very important this morning 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.340
 watching some videos on youtube 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.350
 so I noticed in the umpteenth person e 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.520
 unfortunately pretends to be competent 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.380
 in good teaching 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 which does nothing but bring about 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.129
 give anyone who wants to learn any 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.580
 language in this case English as yes 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.500
 can click on a video and feel like 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 first sentence this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.510
 let's hear it that the english presses 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.129
 no, let's listen to it again because I didn't understand 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.170
 well that the english 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.239
 unfortunately I understand now you will have 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.670
 heard that the entry changed it not 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.680
 I wanted to put the original voice of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.680
 this person out of respect but this one 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 person started this new lesson 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:52.980
 of the course saying blog which means 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.890
 curse does not mean course I do not know 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 if you have understood what it can provide for whom 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.760
 listen to native speakers close to the mother 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.049
 language listening instead of conscious ok 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.670
 change video this would cause it 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.200
 a person who has to learn one 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.090
 language and unfortunately have around 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.549
 people unfortunately I also repeat 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.790
 teachers as I have said before 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.010
 even some qualified do not know how 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.350
 how can a person be reduced to ad 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.049
 be educated by people who do 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.269
 pretend to be instructors now tell me 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.250
 you can start a course with one 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.690
 phrase like that thinking of being of 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.310
 make benefit learners 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.840
 the English points but in which last thanks 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:45.450
 welcome to this English curse o 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.639
 disaster also means let's say not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.609
 we are really a high level of 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.459
 competence and above all we do not want 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.799
 understand that I like other people do not 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.500
 we want to break the balls in saying that 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.450
 the pronunciation important but simply 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.639
 changing the pronunciation or not to do 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.840
 play but maybe a word can 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.750
 also let another resume 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.760
 well practical example has it 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.560
 just done with the course instead of that 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.569
 it's a curse 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.120
 a misfortune 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.570
 or still hear some person who 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.169
 says Italian, let's be skilled and is my 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.960
 kitchen 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.820
 at this point I would start 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.560
 worry because you just said that 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.470
 to have eaten your teacher 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.310
 while clearly you wanted to tell the ace 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.410
 therefore my teacher podium matrix not 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:43.039
 I know if you understand and eat at 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:45.680
 past and hate or still frey number 3 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.479
 if it is pronounced as meaning tree 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.860
 or even with kemp is not frank times 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.030
 means tank 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.440
 let's take another example to make you 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.479
 understand that I don't think we Italians too 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.870
 we appreciate so much when one 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.120
 foreigner pronounces the Italian in 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.250
 very rough way let's imagine 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.870
 a person we have been to 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.300
 taught Italian well from the point of 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.410
 Phonetic view did not take him into 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.139
 this way 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.250
 listen to this sentence today I ate 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.810
 of a trout with cream 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.570
 now I don't know if you understood something 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.099
 but probably this person at 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.039
 which precisely the phonetics was not 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.740
 taught it meant that today it has 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.449
 ate a cream cake now 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.699
 let's imagine instead a person who has 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.500
 there are the phonetic bases of Italian 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.630
 been taught well for not yet 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.120
 eliminated his accent and we repeat 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.120
 the same sentence paris a and eat 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.820
 an anchovy cream this could 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.539
 be an anglophone accent they talk about it 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.330
 in Italian 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.159
 now both sentences are clearly 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.759
 incorrect from a phonetic point of view in 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.800
 Italian then why the hell there 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.490
 we are surprised if some people 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.810
 competent to move to eliminate 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.250
 the ignorance that surrounds us e 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.530
 learning foreign languages 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.880
 especially totally non-english 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.520
 respectful of phonics and 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.800
 say now then tell me if you like one 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.860
 taking this sentence of its own 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.460
 angry at high altitude to tears to the a 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.840
 means an angel wing not to the 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.909
 right then I do n't like that either 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.800
 a foreigner pronounces Italian like this 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.150
 then why the hell pretend to be 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.760
 an English teacher 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:31.700
 let's start a working well version 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.920
 done well done 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.920
 welcome to the English curse 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.140
 english presses
