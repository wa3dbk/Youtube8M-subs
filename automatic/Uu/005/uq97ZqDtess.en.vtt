at<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.120> end<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.019> right<00:01:00.170> there<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.859> can

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
at the end of it right there you can

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.430 
at the end of it right there you can
spin<00:01:01.339> around<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:02.390> your<00:01:02.600> little<00:01:02.750> control<00:01:03.230> pad

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
spin around it's your little control pad

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.290 
spin around it's your little control pad
section<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.070> your<00:01:04.160> figures<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.699> then<00:01:04.790> this

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
section for your figures and then this

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.060 
section for your figures and then this
is<00:01:05.480> able<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.810> come<00:01:05.990> up<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:06.500> up<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.770> up<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:06.950> up

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
is able to come up and up and up and up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.290 
is able to come up and up and up and up
and<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.910> then<00:01:08.300> it's<00:01:08.420> also<00:01:08.690> able<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.350> extend

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
and up and then it's also able to extend

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.170 
and up and then it's also able to extend
beyond<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.890> quite<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> bit<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:13.580> far<00:01:13.790> let's<00:01:14.030> see

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
beyond that quite a bit so far let's see

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.230 
beyond that quite a bit so far let's see
if<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.330> can<00:01:14.480> even<00:01:14.570> keep<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.350> camera<00:01:16.240> doesn't

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
if I can even keep it on camera doesn't

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.260 
if I can even keep it on camera doesn't
look<00:01:17.450> like<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:17.810> gonna<00:01:17.990> make<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:19.030> there<00:01:20.030> goes

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
look like it's gonna make it there goes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.540 
look like it's gonna make it there goes
past<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:21.080> edge<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.820> quite<00:01:23.650> Wow<00:01:24.650> quite<00:01:25.400> an

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
past the edge that is quite Wow quite an

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.890 
past the edge that is quite Wow quite an
extension<00:01:26.090> look<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.390> poor<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.690> down<00:01:26.870> a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
extension look at that poor you down a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.440 
extension look at that poor you down a
little<00:01:27.110> bit<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.950> can<00:01:28.040> see<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.450> extends

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
little bit so you can see that extends

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.920 
little bit so you can see that extends
way<00:01:29.870> past<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.820> front<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.360> cab<00:01:32.600> if<00:01:32.810> you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
way past the the front of the cab if you

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.040 
way past the the front of the cab if you
have<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.260> facing<00:01:33.620> forward<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.240> pretty

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
have it facing forward that is pretty

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.930 
have it facing forward that is pretty
impressive<00:01:36.320> reach<00:01:36.800> right<00:01:37.070> there<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:37.760> of

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
impressive reach right there now of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.880 
impressive reach right there now of
course<00:01:38.150> this<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:38.990> turntable<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
course this is on a turntable so the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.950 
course this is on a turntable so the
whole<00:01:40.010> thing<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.310> able<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.640> rotate<00:01:41.120> around<00:01:41.390> but

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
whole thing is able to rotate around but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.200 
whole thing is able to rotate around but
if<00:01:42.530> you're<00:01:42.680> going<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.830> have<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.250> person<00:01:44.060> out

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
if you're going to have a person out

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.240 
if you're going to have a person out
there<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.450> far<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:45.500> need<00:01:45.620> more<00:01:45.890> stability

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
there that far you need more stability

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.510 
there that far you need more stability
you<00:01:46.640> need<00:01:46.850> lateral<00:01:47.630> side-to-side<00:01:48.140> stability

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
you need lateral side-to-side stability

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.640 
you need lateral side-to-side stability
so<00:01:49.520> does<00:01:50.240> have<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.600> stands<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.140> come<00:01:51.500> out

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
so does have the stands that come out

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.250 
so does have the stands that come out
each<00:01:52.520> side<00:01:52.820> come<00:01:53.150> out<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:55.330> down

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
each side come out and down

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.920 
each side come out and down
and<00:01:57.350> actually<00:01:57.890> lift<00:01:58.250> oopsie<00:01:59.300> nope<00:01:59.480> too<00:01:59.720> far

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and actually lift oopsie nope too far

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.310 
and actually lift oopsie nope too far
just<00:02:00.230> get<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.280> right<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:02.240> there<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
just get it right to to there and on the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.500 
just get it right to to there and on the
other<00:02:03.350> side<00:02:03.650> bring<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.700> down<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.300> there's<00:02:05.450> a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
other side bring this down and there's a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.970 
other side bring this down and there's a
last<00:02:05.780> little<00:02:05.990> thing<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.440> do<00:02:06.680> here<00:02:06.830> you

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
last little thing that you do here you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.240 
last little thing that you do here you
actually<00:02:07.250> twist<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.869> base<00:02:09.080> around<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.860> locks

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
actually twist the base around it locks

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.550 
actually twist the base around it locks
it<00:02:10.490> into<00:02:10.730> place<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.390> now<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:12.290> going<00:02:12.470> to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it into place so now that's not going to

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.160 
it into place so now that's not going to
retract<00:02:13.040> back<00:02:13.370> up<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:13.970> there<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.570> nice<00:02:14.870> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
retract back up in there it's nice and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.870 
retract back up in there it's nice and
sturdy<00:02:15.410> it's<00:02:15.590> actually<00:02:16.310> working

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
sturdy it's actually working

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.660 
sturdy it's actually working
-<00:02:17.510> literally<00:02:18.080> stabilize<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> whole<00:02:19.250> thing<00:02:19.520> so

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
- literally stabilize the whole thing so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.610 
- literally stabilize the whole thing so
I<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.760> bring<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.630> all<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.990> way<00:02:21.080> over<00:02:21.350> by<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
I can bring this all the way over by you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.700 
I can bring this all the way over by you
and<00:02:22.220> then<00:02:22.850> put<00:02:23.360> pressure<00:02:23.690> down<00:02:23.840> over<00:02:24.350> here

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
and then put pressure down over here

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.280 
and then put pressure down over here
it's<00:02:25.220> not<00:02:25.310> causing<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.090> whole<00:02:26.510> vehicle<00:02:26.870> to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
it's not causing the whole vehicle to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.070 
it's not causing the whole vehicle to
lean<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:28.190> has<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.910> actual<00:02:29.300> stability<00:02:29.750> now

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
lean it has the actual stability now

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320 
lean it has the actual stability now
there<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.440> limit<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.250> how<00:02:31.520> much<00:02:31.880> friction

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
there is a limit to how much friction

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.140 
there is a limit to how much friction
there<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:34.040> little<00:02:34.280> hydraulic<00:02:34.880> ram

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
there is in this little hydraulic ram

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.880 
there is in this little hydraulic ram
kind<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.510> simulated<00:02:35.960> area<00:02:36.380> which<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.680> really

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
kind of simulated area which is really

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.310 
kind of simulated area which is really
what's<00:02:37.040> keeping<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.750> will

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
what's keeping this up so that will

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.620 
what's keeping this up so that will
actually<00:02:39.710> move<00:02:39.980> before<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.090> whole<00:02:41.270> truck

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
actually move before the whole truck

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.600 
actually move before the whole truck
leans<00:02:42.320> over<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.800> see<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.340> just

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
leans over you see it's it's just

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.790 
leans over you see it's it's just
balanced<00:02:44.060> very<00:02:44.300> nicely<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.350> well<00:02:45.590> done

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
balanced very nicely it's it's well done

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.980 
balanced very nicely it's it's well done
they<00:02:45.950> got<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.430> physics<00:02:46.880> done<00:02:47.120> quite<00:02:47.780> well

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
they got the the physics done quite well

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.560 
they got the the physics done quite well
there<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.770> little<00:02:48.890> operator<00:02:49.570> little

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
there you have a little operator little

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.250 
there you have a little operator little
secondary<00:02:51.500> control<00:02:51.980> cab<00:02:52.850> section<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.900> just

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
secondary control cab section for just

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.010 
secondary control cab section for just
operating<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.670> turret<00:02:56.060> basically<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
operating the the turret basically and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.410 
operating the the turret basically and
you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.830> actually<00:02:57.980> use<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.760> do<00:02:58.940> remote

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
you can actually use that to do remote

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.600 
you can actually use that to do remote
operations<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.740> hook<00:03:01.160> up<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.520> hose

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
operations so you can hook up a hose

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.750 
operations so you can hook up a hose
you've<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.990> whole<00:03:03.770> reel<00:03:04.040> right<00:03:04.310> here

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
you've got a whole reel right here

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.730 
you've got a whole reel right here
doesn't<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.360> pump<00:03:05.720> on<00:03:05.900> board<00:03:06.170> it's<00:03:06.320> just<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
doesn't have a pump on board it's just a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.770 
doesn't have a pump on board it's just a
truck<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.820> got<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.209> hose<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.540> can

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
truck so it's got a hose you can

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.140 
truck so it's got a hose you can
actually<00:03:09.170> take<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.380> all<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.770> way<00:03:09.920> up<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
actually take that all the way up to the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.350 
actually take that all the way up to the
monitor<00:03:12.020> at<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.860> top<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:13.940> then<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.209> have<00:03:14.330> to

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
monitor at the top but then you have to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.330 
monitor at the top but then you have to
hook<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.780> into<00:03:15.050> an<00:03:15.290> actual<00:03:15.650> pump<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.220> these

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
hook it into an actual pump and these

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.220 
hook it into an actual pump and these
will<00:03:16.580> actually<00:03:16.970> pump<00:03:17.209> water<00:03:17.510> through<00:03:17.690> them

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
will actually pump water through them

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.740 
will actually pump water through them
they<00:03:18.709> are<00:03:18.860> real<00:03:19.160> working<00:03:19.550> tubes<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.540> you'll

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
they are real working tubes but you'll

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.110 
they are real working tubes but you'll
need<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> get<00:03:21.080> or<00:03:21.350> work<00:03:21.980> with<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.430> different<00:03:22.820> set

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
need to get or work with a different set

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.970 
need to get or work with a different set
in<00:03:23.540> order<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.870> make<00:03:24.020> that<00:03:24.200> actually<00:03:24.410> happen

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
in order to make that actually happen

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.729 
in order to make that actually happen
you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:25.489> also<00:03:25.640> bring<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.209> nozzle<00:03:26.810> down<00:03:27.050> from

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.680 
lower and on the other side I also have
a<00:03:51.020> fan<00:03:51.680> unit<00:03:52.040> here<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:53.180> think<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.540> is

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
a fan unit here and I think this is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.840 
a fan unit here and I think this is
supposed<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.440> generator<00:03:55.070> unit<00:03:55.550> or<00:03:55.730> it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
supposed to be a generator unit or it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.180 
supposed to be a generator unit or it
could<00:03:56.000> be<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.390> supplemental<00:03:57.350> pump<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> think

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
could be a supplemental pump but I think

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.530 
could be a supplemental pump but I think
it's<00:03:58.310> supposed<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.520> be<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> generator<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.390> those

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it's supposed to be a generator so those

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
it's supposed to be a generator so those
are<00:03:59.690> all<00:03:59.810> separate<00:04:00.560> things<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:00.980> can<00:04:01.130> use

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
are all separate things that you can use

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.130 
are all separate things that you can use
with<00:04:01.489> your<00:04:01.520> figures<00:04:01.970> before<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.780> take<00:04:03.020> you

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
with your figures before I take you

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.590 
with your figures before I take you
inside<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.100> cab<00:04:04.459> section<00:04:05.060> here<00:04:05.269> I<00:04:05.299> want<00:04:05.540> to

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
inside of the cab section here I want to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.140 
inside of the cab section here I want to
show<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.109> lights<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.829> sound<00:04:07.220> setup<00:04:07.880> that

they have here has

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.480 
they have here has
to<00:04:10.200> triple-a<00:04:11.200> batteries<00:04:11.710> that<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.280> to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
to triple-a batteries that you have to

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.850 
to triple-a batteries that you have to
supply<00:04:12.820> yourself<00:04:13.330> as<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.110> lights<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.650> just

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
supply yourself as the lights you just

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.920 
supply yourself as the lights you just
turn<00:04:15.160> them<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.790> off<00:04:15.880> with<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.600> single

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
turn them on and off with this single

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.840 
turn them on and off with this single
button<00:04:17.260> over<00:04:17.500> here<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.860> then<00:04:18.220> sounds<00:04:18.730> are

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
button over here and then sounds are

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.460 
button over here and then sounds are
over<00:04:19.120> here<00:04:19.360> and<00:04:19.480> there<00:04:19.570> are<00:04:19.690> two<00:04:19.720> sets<00:04:20.260> of

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
over here and there are two sets of

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.070 
over here and there are two sets of
sounds<00:04:21.100> depending<00:04:21.670> upon<00:04:21.760> what<00:04:22.300> region<00:04:22.840> you're

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
sounds depending upon what region you're

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.050 
sounds depending upon what region you're
in<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.680> switch<00:04:23.980> switch<00:04:24.460> between<00:04:24.730> them

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
in you can switch switch between them

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.640 
in you can switch switch between them
for<00:04:25.360> realism

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.920 

so<00:04:34.650> that's<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.760> there's<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.210> little

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
so that's one and then there's a little

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.280 
so that's one and then there's a little
switch<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.590> think<00:04:37.740> it's<00:04:37.860> on<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:38.370> side<00:04:39.169> get<00:04:40.169> my

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
switch I think it's on this side get my

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.260 
switch I think it's on this side get my
finger<00:04:40.590> under<00:04:40.800> there<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.400> hit<00:04:41.730> that<00:04:41.940> switch

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
finger under there just hit that switch

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.779 
finger under there just hit that switch
and<00:04:42.600> turn<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.830> you'll<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.220> this

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.510 

and<00:04:52.789> it's<00:04:52.940> pretty<00:04:53.240> loud<00:04:53.599> so<00:04:54.099> some<00:04:55.099> parents

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
and it's pretty loud so some parents

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.820 
and it's pretty loud so some parents
might<00:04:55.669> get<00:04:55.910> annoyed<00:04:56.330> by<00:04:56.509> that<00:04:56.750> their<00:04:57.319> kids<00:04:57.620> use

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
might get annoyed by that their kids use

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.219 
might get annoyed by that their kids use
it<00:04:57.860> too<00:04:58.610> much<00:04:58.819> but<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.270> can<00:04:59.360> always<00:04:59.509> just<00:04:59.599> use

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
it too much but you can always just use

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.230 
it too much but you can always just use
the<00:05:00.500> light<00:05:00.680> section<00:05:01.069> I<00:05:01.129> appreciate<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:01.819> they

on<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.879> the<00:05:50.210> front<00:05:50.569> it<00:05:50.750> looks<00:05:50.780> like<00:05:51.110> some

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
on the the front it looks like some

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.230 
on the the front it looks like some
other<00:05:51.500> things<00:05:51.800> are<00:05:52.340> kind<00:05:52.490> of<00:05:52.550> mold<00:05:52.849> it<00:05:53.090> into

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
other things are kind of mold it into

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.790 
other things are kind of mold it into
that<00:05:53.569> that<00:05:54.080> extra<00:05:56.020> accessory<00:05:57.020> holder<00:05:57.440> it

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
that that extra accessory holder it

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.839 
that that extra accessory holder it
doesn't<00:05:58.069> actually<00:05:58.159> hold<00:05:58.610> anything

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
doesn't actually hold anything

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.330 
doesn't actually hold anything
additional<00:05:59.750> that<00:05:59.870> you<00:05:59.960> can<00:06:00.080> add<00:06:00.289> on<00:06:00.500> nothing

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
additional that you can add on nothing

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.339 
additional that you can add on nothing
much<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.610> see<00:06:02.030> from<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.389> back<00:06:02.569> has<00:06:02.870> some<00:06:03.080> high

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
much to see from the back has some high

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.059 
much to see from the back has some high
visibility<00:06:04.389> bands<00:06:05.389> there<00:06:05.630> with<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.229> silver

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
visibility bands there with the silver

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.800 
visibility bands there with the silver
going<00:06:07.279> through<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.699> center<00:06:08.029> of<00:06:08.060> it<00:06:08.270> it's<00:06:08.690> too

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
going through the center of it it's too

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.390 
going through the center of it it's too
bad<00:06:08.990> there's<00:06:09.259> only<00:06:09.319> one<00:06:09.500> figure<00:06:10.219> though<00:06:10.370> I

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
bad there's only one figure though I

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.149 
bad there's only one figure though I
really<00:06:10.610> would<00:06:10.819> like<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.330> have<00:06:11.569> seen<00:06:11.840> two<00:06:12.800> at

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
least for this set I think two would

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.110 
least for this set I think two would
have<00:06:15.169> been<00:06:15.319> just<00:06:15.560> just<00:06:15.919> right<00:06:16.130> actually<00:06:16.639> now

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
have been just just right actually now

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.029 
have been just just right actually now
one<00:06:17.270> other<00:06:17.419> thing<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.900> they<00:06:18.020> do<00:06:18.080> to<00:06:18.560> allow

one other thing that they do to allow

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.399 
one other thing that they do to allow
this<00:06:19.219> to<00:06:19.460> adapt<00:06:19.880> to<00:06:20.150> different<00:06:20.360> regions<00:06:21.229> of

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
happy with this set I think that it just

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.029 
happy with this set I think that it just
looks<00:06:58.659> really<00:06:59.659> good<00:06:59.870> especially<00:07:00.199> the<00:07:00.589> cab

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
looks really good especially the cab

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.390 
looks really good especially the cab
section<00:07:01.639> it's<00:07:01.969> got<00:07:02.120> great<00:07:02.419> reach<00:07:03.050> on<00:07:03.380> the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
section it's got great reach on the

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.700 
section it's got great reach on the
itself<00:07:05.090> like<00:07:05.570> I<00:07:05.600> said<00:07:05.780> I<00:07:05.810> really<00:07:05.900> wish<00:07:06.320> it<00:07:06.470> have

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
itself like I said I really wish it have

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.129 
itself like I said I really wish it have
come<00:07:06.949> with<00:07:07.220> two<00:07:07.880> figures<00:07:08.360> I<00:07:08.660> think<00:07:08.870> that<00:07:09.020> would

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
come with two figures I think that would

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.490 
come with two figures I think that would
have<00:07:09.259> been<00:07:09.290> a<00:07:10.009> better<00:07:10.669> better<00:07:11.210> way<00:07:11.419> to<00:07:11.479> to<00:07:12.350> help

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
have been a better better way to to help

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.860 
have been a better better way to to help
kids<00:07:12.800> to<00:07:13.070> get<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.789> right<00:07:14.120> amount<00:07:14.389> of<00:07:14.449> play<00:07:14.660> in

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
kids to get the right amount of play in

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.540 
kids to get the right amount of play in
there<00:07:15.080> if<00:07:15.289> they're<00:07:15.889> not<00:07:16.130> going<00:07:16.370> to<00:07:16.400> get

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
there if they're not going to get

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.529 
there if they're not going to get
another<00:07:17.080> vehicle<00:07:18.080> set<00:07:18.650> as<00:07:18.830> well<00:07:19.430> for<00:07:19.880> a<00:07:20.300> fire

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:20.539 
another vehicle set as well for a fire

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:21.760 
another vehicle set as well for a fire
department<00:07:20.750> you<00:07:21.169> know<00:07:21.229> a<00:07:21.259> small<00:07:21.530> fire

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
department you know a small fire

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.710 
department you know a small fire
department<00:07:22.310> but<00:07:22.430> beyond<00:07:23.150> that<00:07:23.240> I<00:07:23.389> think<00:07:23.539> the

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
department but beyond that I think the

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.770 
department but beyond that I think the
design<00:07:24.259> is<00:07:24.620> really<00:07:25.009> good<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:25.639> stands<00:07:26.539> work

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 
design is really good the stands work

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.529 
design is really good the stands work
well<00:07:27.199> just<00:07:27.710> the<00:07:28.009> overall<00:07:28.370> level<00:07:28.880> of<00:07:28.910> detail<00:07:29.300> is

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:29.539 
well just the overall level of detail is

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.749 
well just the overall level of detail is
good<00:07:29.690> the<00:07:29.930> amount<00:07:30.710> of<00:07:30.889> accessories<00:07:31.370> and

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 
good the amount of accessories and

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.340 
good the amount of accessories and
everything<00:07:31.820> I<00:07:32.180> think<00:07:32.240> it's<00:07:32.449> it's<00:07:32.810> done<00:07:33.080> nicely

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
everything I think it's it's done nicely

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.029 
everything I think it's it's done nicely
much<00:07:34.039> much<00:07:34.400> nicer<00:07:34.820> than<00:07:35.000> the<00:07:35.210> last<00:07:35.750> fire<00:07:36.650> truck

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
much much nicer than the last fire truck

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.700 
much much nicer than the last fire truck
that<00:07:37.280> I<00:07:37.520> and<00:07:38.090> I<00:07:38.180> reviewed<00:07:38.389> there<00:07:38.780> was<00:07:38.900> a<00:07:38.930> lower
