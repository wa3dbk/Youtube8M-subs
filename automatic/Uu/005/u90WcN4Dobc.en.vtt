00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
bags I don't know nothing shit all as

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.940 
bags I don't know nothing shit all as
long<00:02:20.370> as<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.000> turn<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.989> on<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.709> start

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
long as you can turn it on you can start

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.660 
long as you can turn it on you can start
up<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.220> ignition

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
up the ignition

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.830 
up the ignition
and<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.849> get<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> where<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.720> go

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and you get to where you want to go

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.589 
and you get to where you want to go
that's<00:02:25.140> great<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> don't<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
that's great so I don't like it and

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.479 
that's great so I don't like it and
because<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.440> real<00:02:28.650> car<00:02:28.920> game<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
because it is a real car game and

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.089 
because it is a real car game and
there's<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> racing<00:02:30.270> car<00:02:30.300> game<00:02:30.680> they<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.920> to

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
there's a racing car game they have to

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.670 
there's a racing car game they have to
be<00:02:32.220> real<00:02:32.580> realistic<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.660> how<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.319> cars

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
be real realistic about how the cars

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.370 
be real realistic about how the cars
work<00:02:35.099> how<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.849> cars<00:02:36.239> drive<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.870> how<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.050> cars

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
work how the cars drive and how the cars

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.530 
work how the cars drive and how the cars
and<00:02:37.830> generally<00:02:38.430> move<00:02:38.670> around<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> crunched

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and generally move around and I crunched

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.500 
and generally move around and I crunched
up<00:02:39.810> which<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.560> don't<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.180> told

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
up which I don't like and I told

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.699 
up which I don't like and I told
everyone<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.959> about<00:02:43.260> Grand<00:02:43.470> Theft<00:02:43.560> Auto

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
everyone that about Grand Theft Auto

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.960 
everyone that about Grand Theft Auto
compared<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> cars<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.910> an

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
compared to the cars because it's an

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.759 
compared to the cars because it's an
arcade<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.840> will<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.080> will<00:02:49.319> get<00:02:49.440> into<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
arcade that will get will get into the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.199 
arcade that will get will get into the
arcades<00:02:50.190> draw<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.550> bit<00:02:50.760> later<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.030> know<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
arcades draw a little bit later I know I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
said we'll get into a little bit later

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.170 
said we'll get into a little bit later
we<00:02:52.500> would<00:02:52.560> never<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:53.010> why<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.849> still

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
we would never do why is it still

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
we would never do why is it still

so<00:04:14.459> forth<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.079> same

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
so forth so on so it's just the same

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.650 
so forth so on so it's just the same
game<00:04:16.590> essentially<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.060> why<00:04:18.269> not<00:04:18.450> by

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
game essentially so that's why not by

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.259 
game essentially so that's why not by
racing<00:04:19.380> games<00:04:19.620> like<00:04:20.130> i<00:04:20.280> said<00:04:20.579> if<00:04:20.820> they're

style my style of games are too quick

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.909 
style my style of games are too quick
they're<00:04:35.130> too<00:04:35.430> focused<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.380> one<00:04:37.650> bit

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
they're too focused on that that one bit

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.400 
they're too focused on that that one bit
of<00:04:38.270> action<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.449> get<00:04:39.750> instead<00:04:40.169> of<00:04:40.290> a

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
of action that you get instead of a

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.280 
of action that you get instead of a
whole<00:04:40.620> game<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.240> they<00:04:42.240> don't<00:04:42.389> really<00:04:42.690> justify

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
whole game and they don't really justify

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.350 
whole game and they don't really justify
a<00:04:43.320> 60<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.979> 100<00:04:44.430> or<00:04:45.320> 101<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:47.460> play<00:04:47.610> racing<00:04:47.970> games

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
a 60 to 100 or 101 and play racing games

a 60 to 100 or 101 and play racing games
I<00:04:48.660> think<00:04:49.320> that<00:04:49.440> online<00:04:49.620> as<00:04:50.100> well<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.400> would

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
I think that online as well they would

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.879 
I think that online as well they would
lag<00:04:50.699> like<00:04:50.910> fuck<00:04:51.210> which<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.410> don't<00:04:52.560> want<00:04:52.830> to

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
lag like fuck which you don't want to

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.760 
lag like fuck which you don't want to
race<00:04:53.130> again<00:04:53.490> especially<00:04:54.290> but<00:04:55.290> when<00:04:55.440> when<00:04:55.740> I

those<00:05:23.789> accessories<00:05:24.380> but<00:05:25.380> if<00:05:25.620> you're<00:05:26.430> playing

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
those accessories but if you're playing

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.890 
those accessories but if you're playing
it<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.270> another<00:05:27.479> thing<00:05:27.660> i<00:05:27.780> don't

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
it and this is another thing i don't

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.480 
it and this is another thing i don't
like<00:05:27.990> if<00:05:28.260> you're<00:05:28.380> playing<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.770> with<00:05:28.919> a<00:05:28.949> normal

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
like if you're playing it with a normal

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.690 
like if you're playing it with a normal
controller<00:05:30.200> which<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:31.530> some<00:05:31.680> reasons<00:05:32.190> there

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
controller which for some reasons there

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.140 
controller which for some reasons there
it<00:05:32.820> is<00:05:32.880> yeah<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.930> just<00:05:34.320> using<00:05:34.710> see<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.700> kind<00:05:36.000> of

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.690 
it is yeah and just using see it kind of
it<00:05:36.419> doesn't<00:05:36.720> make<00:05:36.810> sense<00:05:37.280> when<00:05:38.280> you<00:05:38.370> can<00:05:38.550> have

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
it doesn't make sense when you can have

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.790 
it doesn't make sense when you can have
a<00:05:38.729> controller<00:05:39.270> thing<00:05:39.630> but<00:05:39.780> i<00:05:39.810> right<00:05:40.289> really

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800
