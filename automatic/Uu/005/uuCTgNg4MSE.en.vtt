this<00:01:06.570> example<00:01:06.990> I'll<00:01:07.350> try<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.040> reports<00:01:08.729> on

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this example I'll try and do reports on

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.649 
this example I'll try and do reports on
the<00:01:09.090> research<00:01:09.540> output<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> next<00:01:12.420> thing<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the research output the next thing you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
the research output the next thing you
have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> decide<00:01:13.050> is<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.890> type<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.190> layout

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
have to decide is which type of layout

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.670 
have to decide is which type of layout
do<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> present<00:01:16.159> your<00:01:17.159> report<00:01:17.700> in

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
do you want to present your report in

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.170 
do you want to present your report in
and<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:22.439> types<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> call

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and we have two types and we call

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.350 
and we have two types and we call
analysis<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.290> example<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> matrix<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
analysis for example the matrix and the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.289 
analysis for example the matrix and the
table<00:01:27.719> here<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.950> major<00:01:29.340> functionality<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
table here the major functionality of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
table here the major functionality of
analysis<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.619> add<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.039> function

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
analysis is that we can add a function

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.029 
analysis is that we can add a function
for<00:01:33.030> example<00:01:33.119> counting<00:01:33.960> something<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
for example counting something as it is

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.760 
for example counting something as it is
illustrated<00:01:35.880> here

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
illustrated here

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.219 
illustrated here
another<00:01:37.770> type<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.070> report<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.240> table<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
another type of report is the table and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.950 
another type of report is the table and
or<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.460> listing<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.030> where<00:01:42.539> we<00:01:42.630> simply

or the listing here where we simply

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
or the listing here where we simply
extract<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.530> content<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.039> list<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.609> for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
extract some content and list it for

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.830 
extract some content and list it for
example<00:01:45.719> as<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.759> simple<00:01:48.149> listing<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.689> or

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
the types of research output so yes

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.180

have the research output types listed
here<00:05:50.940> we<00:05:51.659> have<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.900> research<00:05:52.110> output<00:05:52.650> years

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
here we have the research output years

here we have the research output years
listed<00:05:53.729> here<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.090> we<00:05:54.810> have<00:05:54.930> a<00:05:54.960> count<00:05:55.289> for<00:05:56.219> each

listed here and we have a count for each

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.279 
listed here and we have a count for each
within<00:05:57.150> this<00:05:57.419> matrix<00:05:57.810> here<00:05:58.320> this<00:05:59.900> looks<00:06:00.900> ok

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
within this matrix here this looks ok

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.140 
within this matrix here this looks ok
it's<00:06:01.409> me<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:01.889> I<00:06:02.039> would<00:06:02.219> like<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.639> add<00:06:02.820> a

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
it's me but I would like to add a

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.879 
it's me but I would like to add a
summary<00:06:03.680> or<00:06:04.680> sum<00:06:05.190> for<00:06:05.909> each<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:07.440> can<00:06:07.560> see<00:06:07.740> the

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
summary or sum for each you can see the

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.350 
summary or sum for each you can see the
difference<00:06:08.280> here<00:06:08.460> in<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.639> preview<00:06:09.090> again

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
difference here in the preview again

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.459 
difference here in the preview again
we'll<00:06:10.050> get<00:06:10.259> the<00:06:11.009> total<00:06:11.840> column<00:06:12.840> yeah<00:06:13.169> and<00:06:13.319> the

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
we'll get the total column yeah and the

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:14.740 
we'll get the total column yeah and the
total<00:06:13.800> row<00:06:13.949> here

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
total row here

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.559 
total row here
remember<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.960> preview<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:17.060> really<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.090> preview

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
remember the preview is really a preview

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.200 
remember the preview is really a preview
only<00:06:18.690> cannot<00:06:19.530> count<00:06:19.860> on<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.460> results<00:06:20.880> of<00:06:21.030> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
only cannot count on the results of the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.850 
only cannot count on the results of the
preview<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:22.050> be<00:06:22.639> precise<00:06:23.639> this<00:06:24.599> is<00:06:24.780> due<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.020> if

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
preview to be precise this is due to if

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.100 
preview to be precise this is due to if
we<00:06:26.340> extract<00:06:26.699> a<00:06:26.849> lot<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.270> data<00:06:27.479> from<00:06:27.840> viewer

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
we extract a lot of data from viewer

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.800 
we extract a lot of data from viewer
this<00:06:28.289> might<00:06:28.469> take<00:06:28.800> quite<00:06:29.340> a<00:06:29.400> while<00:06:29.639> so<00:06:30.569> by

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
this might take quite a while so by

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.589 
this might take quite a while so by
doing<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.080> preview<00:06:31.469> we<00:06:31.800> do<00:06:31.979> just<00:06:32.969> a<00:06:33.120> preview<00:06:33.360> of

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
doing a preview we do just a preview of

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.189 
doing a preview we do just a preview of
the<00:06:33.750> layout

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.469 

each<00:06:39.199> of<00:06:39.500> these<00:06:39.650> groupings<00:06:40.270> contain<00:06:41.270> some

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
each of these groupings contain some

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.040 
each of these groupings contain some
complexity<00:06:42.229> of<00:06:42.259> its<00:06:42.800> own<00:06:43.099> so<00:06:43.610> I<00:06:44.020> referred<00:06:45.020> to

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
complexity of its own so I referred to

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.350 
complexity of its own so I referred to
another<00:06:45.800> screencast<00:06:46.250> where<00:06:46.729> we<00:06:46.819> go<00:06:46.940> into<00:06:47.120> more

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
another screencast where we go into more

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.600 
another screencast where we go into more
details<00:06:47.810> with<00:06:48.050> how<00:06:48.259> to<00:06:48.319> adjust<00:06:49.250> these

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
details with how to adjust these

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.719 
details with how to adjust these
groupings<00:06:50.150> as<00:06:50.330> well<00:06:51.220> you<00:06:52.220> could<00:06:52.400> add<00:06:52.550> on

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
groupings as well you could add on

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.240 
groupings as well you could add on
another<00:06:53.240> content<00:06:53.930> type<00:06:54.080> on<00:06:54.379> another<00:06:54.889> type<00:06:55.220> of

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
another content type on another type of

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.149 
another content type on another type of
layout<00:06:55.699> to<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.090> reports<00:06:56.599> does<00:06:57.440> creating<00:06:57.919> some

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159 
layout to the reports does creating some

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:01.360 
layout to the reports does creating some
more<00:06:58.340> complex<00:06:58.819> reports<00:06:59.979> however<00:07:00.979> I'm

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
more complex reports however I'm

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.460 
more complex reports however I'm
satisfied<00:07:01.639> with<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.270> layout<00:07:02.569> as<00:07:02.840> it<00:07:03.080> is<00:07:03.199> now

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
satisfied with the layout as it is now

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.550 
satisfied with the layout as it is now
and<00:07:03.740> I'll<00:07:04.370> try<00:07:04.669> and<00:07:04.819> create<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.150> PDF<00:07:05.840> version<00:07:06.020> of

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
and I'll try and create a PDF version of

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.360 
and I'll try and create a PDF version of
the<00:07:06.620> report<00:07:07.190> and<00:07:07.780> as<00:07:08.780> you<00:07:08.900> can<00:07:09.050> see<00:07:09.110> here<00:07:09.500> this

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
the report and as you can see here this

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.390 
the report and as you can see here this
is<00:07:10.430> the<00:07:10.639> result<00:07:14.110> where<00:07:15.110> we<00:07:15.229> get<00:07:15.830> a<00:07:15.860> description

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
is the result where we get a description
