one<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> things<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.610> love<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
one of the things I love about the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.799 
one of the things I love about the
quilter<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:10.139> its<00:00:11.010> size<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.880> somewhat

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
quilter is it its size is somewhat

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.169 
quilter is it its size is somewhat
deceiving<00:00:13.170> because<00:00:14.099> sonically<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.940> can

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
deceiving because sonically what I can

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.790 
deceiving because sonically what I can
get<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.080> sound<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> some<00:00:16.619> much

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
get out of it is the sound of some much

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.179 
get out of it is the sound of some much
larger<00:00:16.830> amps<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> couple

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
larger amps and I do that with a couple

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.950 
larger amps and I do that with a couple
of<00:00:20.220> knob<00:00:20.369> turns<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.910> okay<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.720> things

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
of knob turns here okay so first things

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439 
of knob turns here okay so first things
first<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> add<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
first I like to add a little bit of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.720 
first I like to add a little bit of
trouble<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.529> bit<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> bass<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
trouble and a little bit of bass and the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
trouble and a little bit of bass and the
treble<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.390> brings<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
treble just brings in some of that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.160 
treble just brings in some of that
sparkly<00:00:28.800> articulation<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> bass<00:00:30.449> brings

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
sparkly articulation and the bass brings

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
sparkly articulation and the bass brings
in<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> body<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> ton<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
in a lot of body now there's a ton of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
in a lot of body now there's a ton of
low-end<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> amp<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.980> bass<00:00:35.160> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
low-end from this amp and if bass just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.299 
low-end from this amp and if bass just
accentuates<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:37.100> another<00:00:38.100> knob

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
accentuates some of that another knob

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
accentuates some of that another knob
that<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:38.969> limiter<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.960> I'll<00:00:40.050> show

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that I like is the limiter so I'll show

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
that I like is the limiter so I'll show
you<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> sound<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.700> before

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you what I have for a sound here before

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.209 
you what I have for a sound here before
I<00:00:42.420> add<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> limiter

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.580 

that's<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.480> neck<00:00:47.629> pickup<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.199> here's<00:00:48.440> the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
that's on the neck pickup and here's the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
that's on the neck pickup and here's the
bridge

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.689 

there's<00:00:53.199> a<00:00:53.289> ton<00:00:53.469> of<00:00:53.500> headroom<00:00:53.829> which<00:00:54.219> means<00:00:54.460> if

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
there's a ton of headroom which means if

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.150 
there's a ton of headroom which means if
I<00:00:54.820> dig<00:00:55.120> in<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:56.170> quilter<00:00:56.500> gets<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.739> ton<00:00:56.920> louder

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
I dig in the quilter gets a ton louder

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.279 
I dig in the quilter gets a ton louder
if<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.519> roll<00:00:57.730> off<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:57.940> volume<00:00:58.210> it<00:00:58.420> cleans<00:00:58.690> up<00:00:58.870> so

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
if I roll off the volume it cleans up so

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.440 
if I roll off the volume it cleans up so
I'll<00:00:59.379> show<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.559> what<00:00:59.680> that<00:00:59.710> sounds<00:00:59.829> like

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.109 

so<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.680> responsive<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.520> reactive

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so it's really responsive and reactive

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.160 
so it's really responsive and reactive
to<00:01:09.650> your<00:01:10.650> musicality<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> roll<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to your musicality when I roll up this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
to your musicality when I roll up this
limiter<00:01:13.590> knob<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.729> its<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.630> bring

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
limiter knob what its gonna do is bring

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
limiter knob what its gonna do is bring
the<00:01:16.350> overall<00:01:16.830> volume<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> add<00:01:23.399> a<00:01:23.430> little

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the overall volume down and add a little

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
the overall volume down and add a little
bit<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> squish<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> compression<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.500> call<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
bit of squish and compression we call it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.580 
bit of squish and compression we call it
bloom<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> blossom<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:27.780> things<00:01:28.080> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
bloom and blossom all these things just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
bloom and blossom all these things just
make<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.830> amp<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.039> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.490> musical

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
make the amp a little bit more musical

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
make the amp a little bit more musical
because<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.899> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> squishes<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.770> forgives

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
because it kind of squishes and forgives

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.190 
because it kind of squishes and forgives
some<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> ways<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.850> play<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
some of the ways we play I like it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
some of the ways we play I like it
because<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.649> has<00:01:34.680> almost<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.570> percussive

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
because it has almost a percussive

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
because it has almost a percussive
southern<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> sound<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.009> from<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
southern kind of sound and I'm from the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.620 
southern kind of sound and I'm from the
south<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.789> makes<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.090> feel<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.509> at

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
south so it makes me feel like I'm at

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.219 
south so it makes me feel like I'm at
home<00:01:39.780> again

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
home again

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.040 
home again
so<00:01:40.770> again<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.610> extra<00:01:42.090> gain<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
so again with a little extra gain and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.690 
so again with a little extra gain and
with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> limiter<00:01:43.619> turned<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> maybe<00:01:44.460> 2

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
with a limiter turned up to maybe 2

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
with a limiter turned up to maybe 2
o'clock<00:01:44.940> or<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.229> something<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
o'clock or so now you get something that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
o'clock or so now you get something that
can<00:01:47.429> be<00:01:47.580> funky<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.659> driven

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.880 

now<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.179> lose<00:02:10.479> some<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> Headroom<00:02:11.349> but

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
now you lose some of the Headroom but

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.160 
now you lose some of the Headroom but
again<00:02:12.130> what<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:12.459> gain<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.270> sound<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.959> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
again what your gain is the sound of a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.380 
again what your gain is the sound of a
much<00:02:14.560> bigger<00:02:14.920> amp<00:02:15.280> turned<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:16.209> up

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
much bigger amp turned all the way up

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.290 
much bigger amp turned all the way up
right<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.500> even<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.580> bridge<00:02:19.090> position

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
right so even in the the bridge position

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:37.920 
right so even in the the bridge position
would<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.720> more<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.140> rock<00:02:20.319> setting

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.140 

and<00:02:38.930> again<00:02:39.230> sounds<00:02:40.040> like<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.160> much<00:02:40.460> bigger<00:02:40.850> amp

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
