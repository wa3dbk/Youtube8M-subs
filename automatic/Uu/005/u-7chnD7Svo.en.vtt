00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I added to the hood I feel like it gives

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.760

it<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.600> edgy<00:00:36.600> vibe<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it a really edgy vibe but it's just a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670 
it a really edgy vibe but it's just a
black<00:00:37.980> wool<00:00:38.309> cloak<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.559> bit

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
black wool cloak and it's a little bit

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
black wool cloak and it's a little bit
full<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.129> too<00:00:41.370> full<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> lined

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
full but not too full and then I lined

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
full but not too full and then I lined
it<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.530> cute<00:00:43.800> peach<00:00:44.219> satin<00:00:44.700> lining

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
which I think adds a really nice

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.000 
which I think adds a really nice
feminine<00:00:46.770> touch<00:00:47.270> to<00:00:48.270> any<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.559> an<00:00:49.680> outfit

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
