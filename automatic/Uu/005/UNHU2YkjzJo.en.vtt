there's<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> 60s<00:01:01.050> everybody<00:01:01.379> was

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
there's in the 60s everybody was

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
there's in the 60s everybody was
fighting<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> information<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
fighting to get the information and it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.630 
fighting to get the information and it
was<00:01:04.019> difficult<00:01:04.530> travel<00:01:04.830> wasn't<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> same

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
was difficult travel wasn't the same

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
was difficult travel wasn't the same
budget<00:01:05.909> certainly<00:01:06.659> weren't<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
budget certainly weren't the same so in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
budget certainly weren't the same so in
part<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> save<00:01:09.840> each<00:01:10.260> team

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
part I think it was to save each team

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
part I think it was to save each team
needing<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:11.909> each<00:01:12.090> guy<00:01:12.420> they

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
needing to go to see each guy they

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.320 
needing to go to see each guy they
banded<00:01:13.350> together<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.520> helped<00:01:14.909> defray

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
banded together and it helped defray

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
banded together and it helped defray
