00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.210
 Good 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.350
 It's really subtitles, so I'm finally getting rid of the cold, but still a little 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.330
 I'm not feeling well 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:18.190
 I want to start with a loose sound My computer desk that has been used for many years is broken 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.420
 Significantly renewed the work space of the personal computer relationship this time in the wake of and was gone 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.940
 I decided to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.870
 After all it tries to make Mac the desktop it becomes the cause 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:32.210
 It was decided that it was a big turning point for me 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:35.080
 I may not need so much this time, but it is uploaded as my personal record video 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.080
 I would like 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.840
 PC desks I've used so far are really cheap and low type things 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.840
 In other words, it was a type that was sitting on the floor and I did not go for work for a long time at all 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.150
 Ne 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.910
 I originally had no habit of using a PC for so long, but now I'm posting videos 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:08.650
 It takes a long time to work on it, and will soon add Macs 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.770
 A long time where this time in the not to work 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.220
 Thought about the environment to support to a certain extent 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.950
 However, this time it is not from the cost of the house but 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.540
 However, Ikeya's all the chairs and chairs are the result of various search to raise as cheap as possible 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.630
 I decided to align 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.670
 But actually I have failed once 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.799
 I Te that I mean Tsu desk purchased this time 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.450
 There are a lot of discus feet and it is your choice and you have a set that suits you 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.530
 It was a type that can be assembled 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.390
 The results in the attempt to raise as much as possible cheaply as was talking a while ago 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 I chose a 150 x 75 cm table top for the front door series 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.469
 In and What is the price of the street table top, which you can see Yes tax 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.859
 It is a super cheap called 3,499 yen 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:03.789
 Just because there is a reason for being so cheap 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:07.450
 First of all, the material is particle board and the core is paper 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.149
 In other words, the contents are paper materials . 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 Not bad 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.950
 It's not easy, and the load capacity is 50 kg, enough. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.670
 There are quite a lot of benefits, but only 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.260
 I can say that I felt sloppy when I was in Kofu 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.049
 But this table is I've been jammed tightly contents of the extraordinary Gate series table 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.140
 I say that I feel the top is not full of contents 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.280
 Even if I hit it a little 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.380
 I do not like that kind of feeling that hollow out 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.890
 I came back Te also won once the results I thought if kana to go through from this many years 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.610
 but 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 Return 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.450
 We bought for the table top of such feeling 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.450
 Ah 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.530
 This table top is 10,999 yen 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.990
 I was fascinated by the fact that it resembled a table that was sloppyly supported 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.400
 Te resulting in still tether Ritoka texture I'd had so much cheaper in a sound 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.930
 But it is important 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 I used it for quite a while, so I tried a little extra luxury this time 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.680
 In it this table 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.080
 It is easy again to fit the top 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.080
 Hey I say this with a single 250 yen 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:28.000
 Those who are thought to why you want anyway cheap and wide space of the desk 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:34.120
 Aligned with Hajime Li series of load-bearing 50 kilograms lighter Kedomo there is little feeling that was lean, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.750
 If say would buy a flame and the yen 4,499 75 centimeters of the table to apply 150 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.640
 Hey 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.740
 It is really cheap depending on what you choose . 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:48.200
 I think it's pretty good and I wanted a drawer this time 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:52.780
 After all table top 10,999 Yen and 4 feet and 1000 Yen 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.780
 After I drawer unit also added to buy directly below 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:05.590
 Yes this happened and eventually it was nearly 20,000 yen but it was a table top 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.099
 There is also a 5-stage drawer with a size of 155 cm and 75 cm. 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.080
 I think I'm pretty expensive 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.080
 Desk chair was also bought at ikea's 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:24.740
 This is also the most comfortable thing to try sitting down 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.740
 And what is easy and above all 110 kg load capacity 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.310
 This was quite important 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:41.180
 As for the chair though, I was quite lost because of really pin machine 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.920
 This time it comfortable is better than the most common office chair as my reference chosen and now 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:50.020
 I chose the one that feels close to the seat of the car riding for a long time every day 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.020
 I like it so far 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:00.199
 Yes, in fact this time I have not taken anything to the assembly scene 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:04.970
 It was easy to look at the decoration but I felt it was easier if there was an electric tool 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.830
 I mean Note N only'm a little depth Issu I Ene I Etsura hand-cranked of driver 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.950
 BEFORE anymore gulp Nde had confused the computer desk around until about now 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.140
 Please visit after sales 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:21.530
 Seems to be Is not close this To think you Yes So go you'll salt 20 years 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.530
 This is how I used to use a broken computer desk 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:36.540
 I had to sit down and work on the ground again 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.540
 This sliding keyboard table is broken 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:46.000
 To do it would have fallen if a little shifted hits in Ravenswood corrupted 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.000
 In even three-stage box of this right, et al. 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.440
 The usability was so bad that it was decided to introduce a drawer unit to make it clearer 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.690
 is 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.330
 Yes I'm going, so I bought this time from the state of the mess that I saw now 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:06.849
 8 feet on ikea's tabletop 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.300
 And when you replace it with a drawer unit and desk chain like this 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.259
 The 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.259
 ni 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.540
 Ah ah ah N 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:26.870
 I wonder how damn it was refreshing 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:26.870
 This by budget summary left is what Io left is oddly left is what left 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.090
 I have not been able to get enough time, but I still can not buy it 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.090
 It is because we have a space to receive Macs 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:48.759
 It is an impression that it seems to be alive more than I thought I would just put two PCs 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:52.259
 This drawer is all the contents of the three-tiered box that you saw earlier 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.259
 It can be stored freely 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.690
 This drawer is enough storage capacity of about remaining 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:06.240
 6 open and close with slide rail 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.410
 In the assembly itself was not so difficult, but there are only 5 bullets indeed 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.540
 Took the 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:14.050
 In again computer desk around with do not yet a completed form to not come even Mac 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:19.690
 After calming down, it is 5 kinds again 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:23.440
 Nde computer desk that has been used for many years to say I would like to introduce and I think it is broken 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:27.580

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.610
