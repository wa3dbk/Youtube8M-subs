00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 what are youtube wave guys are I hope 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.589
 are very well I bring the texture of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 his exam art is a very very texture 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 famous and very beautiful the truth is one thousand 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 favorite textures made a while 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.910
 let's say it was my favorite texture 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 when it was vegetable rat 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 robert not be not to be told alone 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.760
 but when I liked a lot of vegetable 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.760
 because in case you do not know 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.330
 this is the texture that vegetable occupies in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 his series of plant planet that then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.160
 before I saw that series the truth 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 I liked it a lot but well I do not see it anymore 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 but obviously the texture itself gave 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 a quite original and pretty touch 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.579
 nice but some guys finally the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 they carried here to pocket as in the brings 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.629
 some things that were not converted by 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 example here the wheat the carrots the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.650
 potatoes and this is not converted 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.450
 what is bad 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.670
 but as you can see later the majority 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.700
 of things that is the important thing itself yes 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.340
 is converted it can be said that the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.370
 texture is 16 x 16 so if you notice 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.320
 here you will see a little pixelated that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.610
 means that the texture is not the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.060
 original texture of lack expander is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.370
 32 x 32 but good indeed painful for 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.050
 example the heads these if they are 32 x 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.850
 32 or well I do not know if they are 32 or 64 x 64 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.280
 but here in these heads and it is reached 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.470
 to notice that this is hd that is to say these 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.180
 they are made to the original texture but 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 like pretty minecraft and it does not support itself 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.800
 blocks I think of more good text but that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.200
 yes your door but you have books for 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.690
 that in the portage they do with format 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 16 x 16 maybe those who do not understand 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.619
 many stories were 2000 we have been 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.619
 basically speaking good textures 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.470
 There are sizes that are 16 x 16 32 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.020
 etcetera up to 128 and the more the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.119
 number is higher as more h of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 weeks textures and there are textures like 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.450
 this one that need to be very hd so that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 look good and in this case if the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.010
 reduce the pixels obviously 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.230
 a little bit ugly but then yes we 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.200
 keeps capturing the essence not of the 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.430
 texture and then they look pretty good 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 what good guys how did you decide this is the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.620
 texture your art expand a very texture 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.330
 nice to show you I bring you like this 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.780
 obviously when they release a version 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.300
 officer already has full full ported with 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.190
 with the full size and everything 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.540
 is also taking them away in video by 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.890
 the moment I bring you this for all 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.140
 assets that I know there are a lot of people that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.430
 he likes that texture for the same reason 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 I tell them that vegeta la usa is a 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.930
 texture very father and very used and as 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 I tell them it's really worth it because 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.459
 This texture is very original and very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.140
 very father or not good to say one and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.060
 again is very father the texture guys 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.010
 and as I say, I leave you one 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 description already serves well with blog 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.050
 launcher is no longer apk it is a sip that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 As you know, it is installed as always 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.890
 installed in block lunch is like putting 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.780
 the boats have no texture because 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.450
 in the absence of original examination does not have boats 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.040
 of that type and then a few things 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.580
 as first, same, for example, 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.530
 trees do not have textures at the moment 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.840
 but as I say it complies with the basics and what 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.030
 basic because it's so pretty so nothing 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.700
