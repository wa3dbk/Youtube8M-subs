quick one this week here are the board
behind<00:00:11.070> me<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.670> can<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.150> are<00:00:12.450> two

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
behind me if you can see it are two

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.959 
behind me if you can see it are two
words<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.590> are<00:00:13.769> commonly<00:00:14.219> confused<00:00:14.460> by

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
words that are commonly confused by

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.980 
words that are commonly confused by
students<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.359> other<00:00:18.539> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
students one is for and the other is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.810 
students one is for and the other is
since<00:00:19.970> now<00:00:21.020> they<00:00:22.020> both<00:00:22.199> similar<00:00:22.920> meanings<00:00:23.400> but

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
since now they both similar meanings but

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000 
since now they both similar meanings but
are<00:00:23.970> used<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.510> different<00:00:24.810> ways<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.619> these

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
are used in different ways and these

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.790 
are used in different ways and these
ways<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.340> often<00:00:26.849> confused<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> mixed<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.960> but

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
ways are often confused and mixed up but

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
ways are often confused and mixed up but
if<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.010> look<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.150> simple<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
if we look at this we see how simple it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.759 
if we look at this we see how simple it
is<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> right

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
is to get it right

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.100 
is to get it right
firstly<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.360> look<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.750> four<00:00:34.969> four<00:00:35.969> plus<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
firstly we look at four four plus a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310 
firstly we look at four four plus a
period<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.940> period<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:39.989> meaning

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
period of time a period of time meaning

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
period of time a period of time meaning
a<00:00:40.469> length<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.129> time<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.360> example<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.649> two

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
a length of time so for example for two

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
a length of time so for example for two
hours<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.820> waited<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.170> two<00:00:46.200> hours<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.980> my

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
hours I waited for two hours for my

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.500 
hours I waited for two hours for my
friend<00:00:47.840> for<00:00:48.840> three<00:00:49.200> days<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:50.010> went<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> Paris

friend for three days I went to Paris

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
friend for three days I went to Paris
for<00:00:52.020> three<00:00:52.050> days<00:00:53.360> for<00:00:54.360> seven<00:00:54.840> years<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.379> have

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

finally that castle has stood on that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.570 
finally that castle has stood on that
hill<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:04.379> three<00:01:04.799> centuries<00:01:06.920> okay<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hill for three centuries okay so there

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
hill for three centuries okay so there
are<00:01:08.610> periods<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.299> time<00:01:09.510> hours<00:01:10.080> days<00:01:10.439> years<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
are periods of time hours days years and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
are periods of time hours days years and
centuries<00:01:11.869> since<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.830> similar<00:01:14.330> however

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
centuries since is very similar however

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
centuries since is very similar however
instead<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.259> period<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> time<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
instead of a period of time we have a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.289 
instead of a period of time we have a
point<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:21.170> since<00:01:22.170> plus<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.040> point<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.820> time

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
point in time since plus a point in time

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
point in time since plus a point in time
for<00:01:25.200> example<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.939> been<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.479> since<00:01:28.290> 2<00:01:29.159> o

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
for example I have been here since 2 o

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.780 
for example I have been here since 2 o
clock<00:01:29.450> two<00:01:30.450> o<00:01:30.479> clock<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> point<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.280> not

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
clock two o clock is a point in time not

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
clock two o clock is a point in time not
a<00:01:32.850> period<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.659> time<00:01:34.579> okay<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.509> been<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

open point in time but it's still a
point<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.480> time<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:20.010> unfortunately<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.190> not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
point in time that unfortunately is not

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.810 
point in time that unfortunately is not
true<00:02:21.700> anymore<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:23.350> yes<00:02:23.740> I've<00:02:24.040> played<00:02:24.370> guitar
