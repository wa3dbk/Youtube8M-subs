00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
now we are loosening up a line you can

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.200 
now we are loosening up a line you can
also<00:00:33.120> microwave<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:33.960> 10<00:00:34.260> seconds<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.829> so

also microwave it for 10 seconds or so
in<00:00:36.210> hindsight<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.380> might<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.829> used<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.399> little

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
in hindsight I might have used a little

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
in hindsight I might have used a little
bit<00:00:38.790> more<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> had<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> chicken

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
bit more long as I had a lot of chicken

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
bit more long as I had a lot of chicken
but<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.040> taste<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.660> was<00:00:42.660> outstanding<00:00:43.320> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but the taste was was outstanding so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.069 
but the taste was was outstanding so
we're<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> squeeze<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.370> fresh<00:00:44.670> lime

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
we're going to squeeze this fresh lime

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.010 
we're going to squeeze this fresh lime
directly<00:00:46.079> into<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> marinade<00:00:47.090> as<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
directly into the marinade as we have it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.130 
directly into the marinade as we have it
now<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> bowl<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.940> after<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
now in the bowl and then after we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
now in the bowl and then after we
squeeze<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> limes<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> next<00:00:53.520> step<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
squeeze the limes in the next step is to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.270 
squeeze the limes in the next step is to
get<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.480> oil<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.320> simple<00:00:55.649> vegetable<00:00:55.800> oil

want to use olive oil for this roughly
two<00:01:00.750> tablespoons<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
two tablespoons and now we're going to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.870 
two tablespoons and now we're going to
whisk<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.989> emulsifies<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.220> two
