00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.800 

better<00:02:00.979> from<00:02:01.549> Barca<00:02:01.969> but<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.299> cruel<00:02:02.570> game

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
better from Barca but it's a cruel game

really<00:02:17.219> today<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.519> far<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.209> afraid<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.659> more

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
really today so far I'm afraid it's more

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.300 
really today so far I'm afraid it's more
the<00:02:19.260> same<00:02:19.439> for<00:02:19.769> more<00:02:19.920> unsure<00:02:20.069> widths<00:02:20.609> I<00:02:22.310> think

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the same for more unsure widths I think

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.559 
the same for more unsure widths I think

they saw all about big hits but you see
a<00:02:38.069> lot<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:38.519> clever<00:02:38.849> getting<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.420> single

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
a lot more clever getting this single

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.780 
a lot more clever getting this single
every<00:02:40.230> ball<00:02:45.590> ready<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.859> deep<00:02:47.010> saving<00:02:47.489> for

every ball ready in the deep saving for

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.619 
every ball ready in the deep saving for
but<00:02:47.970> still<00:02:48.209> two<00:02:48.389> more<00:02:50.239> through<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.359> ideal

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
but still two more through the ideal
