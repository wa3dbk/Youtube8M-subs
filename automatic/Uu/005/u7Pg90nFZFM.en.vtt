00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 yes hello in this video I want you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.849
 a small overview of the new 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.509
 xbox one give so today was the xbox 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 one presented and yes there are already 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 some information about the xbox and the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 I would like to summarize you once because 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 that's quite a swirl we come true 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.699
 is what is there for new ones 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.130
 features are actually that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.769
 main feature of the xbox is from 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 that is now more than just a console 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 should 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.399
 So she's supposed to be many like that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 pc to become a pc so to speak 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.290
 should there be social networks the tv music 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.149
 to combine into each other so should not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 more to be focused on playing only 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.000
 but also all the other aspects 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.649
 Watching TV or what I'm into 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 be on facebook that should all this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.980
 implement and yes it should be all 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 Devices in the living room with in the system 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.890
 So what do I integrate with 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.689
 smartphones and tablets can then be 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 make entries as far as I know 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.490
 but only with windows 8 tablets 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.170
 Can you then this same as what 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.689
 I use keyboard or so 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.430
 and yes, that should be so integrated 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.119
 and want the xbox but 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.610
 so to speak, the main of the rotary and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 The focal point in the living room will be the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.840
 Everything is about it and you get everything 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.369
 can make 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 There is also a new kinect sensor 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.070
 which can now record via pulse beat 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.960
 So the far better is like that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 previous 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 and yes the controller is at 40 points 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.950
 edited but still looks 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 just like the previous one 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.259
 oh yes, and now there are two new ones 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 control options so once 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.560
 the voice control so that runs so that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.990
 one then simply says xbox and then 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.290
 turns off the xbox 1 or that one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.079
 so that a game can start or the tv 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 can activate mode yes then there is 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.170
 You can still control the gesture 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.410
 even imagine what death with it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 What is meant is that yes about the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 kinect-sensor 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.190
 make any hand movements 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.870
 and then something opens up yes 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:27.250
 then comes the interface that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.000
 just about looks like windows phone 8 and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.400
 The kernel of the xbox one system is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.890
 also built on windows 8 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.410
 So that has pretty much 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.480
 parallel to windows 8 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.970
 yes and this is the multitasking 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.070
 that is needed for that, of course 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.440
 that is more than a console now 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.350
 can now play between and tv 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.760
 just switch without that 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.220
 must restart game and then can 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 just switch back and so on 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.770
 then continue playing to new without the game 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.630
 start 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.590
 then the game is paused 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.630
 with the reason simply then there is still 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.930
 you can do that with snap mode 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.190
 Imagine that, for example 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.140
 you can watch TV then 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.800
 at the same time open facebook and what 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.290
 Post 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.090
 and all that on a monitor 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.720
 that a second window is opened 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.930
 in parallel to the television to the tv on 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.489
 which one then what I do something 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.340
 can any app can and can 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.520
 then you can use them then come 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.550
 we still have to hardware yes that should be one 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.780
 be eight-day cpu and eight gigabyte 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.750
 ram should have the xbox and usb 3.0 and 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.600
 a blu ray drive and the whole 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.630
 should appear in 64 bit architecture 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.330
 and the memory should be 500 gb in size 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.500
 and yes there are interfaces as wlan 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.880
 and hdmi 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.890
 that also new that with wlan but that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.400
 That's why it's so necessary 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.130
 integrated because that too the xbox 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.140
 more and more on cloud sets and yes things 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.269
 In addition, it should store in the cloud 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.130
 also be relieved that one yes 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.360
 player takes what's just for 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.580
 youtuber will be interesting and more 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.820
