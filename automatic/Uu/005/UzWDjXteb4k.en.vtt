00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.779
 because when you said that for pigeon herrera in the book fair was 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.410
 very important 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.950
 the closeness and contact with the public wants to see can be but 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.839
 Photographs 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:12.699
 the combo 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.580
 a hundred arrested who for being human 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.610
 I'm interested but that there are two genomes in the case of 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.739
 dove 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.199
 because he cheered in a lot of people all the time 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.010
 but it is actually the contact is purely the moment of creation 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.180
 that is why it is a subjective opinion 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.980
 but the contact you want 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.990
 she practically when it comes out that her art soto and this 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.880
 and finished the good work for mulberry person who shows up badly but in the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.530
 moment that is being created 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.210
 and settle for the energy of so far is in contact with the public 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.260
 these characters are surrounded by 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 occasions because of the need 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040
 i very particular functions 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.610
 suddenly they are with you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.510
 as well as climate 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.979
 good part of the block 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.480
 percent 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.620
 I've been in photography for many years but 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.860
 let's say photographer matters that can be said of artificial light 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.850
 and I artistically have a serious unsolved problem and that is not going to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.260
 have a solution because it is 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.770
 when I'm photographing them, there's a function done after my production. 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.370
 natural artistic fact 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.700
 in the studio I feel that the artistic fact that was more in my hands 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 because if the creator 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.900
 and I have to get them to transmit even a percentage of 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.420
 what were the merger 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.159
 so although I have more technique in the study I have more proximity 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 I have more than almost everything I have less creative intensity on the part of the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.340
 artist that I photograph I have mine then balance is produced but 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 I never got to solve that scenario photo to save the one from some 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.290
 way 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.360
 have the study technique less now than with the equipment there 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.350
 it is practically impossible 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.580
 oo that the study procedure I have all the technique what happens in the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.519
 scenario I think good at this point is difficult to be
