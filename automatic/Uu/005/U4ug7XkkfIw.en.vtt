strange I don't actually have any

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.290 
strange I don't actually have any
enchantment<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:52.750> letting<00:02:52.990> me<00:02:54.300> all

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
enchantment and it's letting me all

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.450 
enchantment and it's letting me all
right<00:02:55.480> I'm<00:02:55.990> just<00:02:56.320> but<00:02:56.500> here<00:02:56.800> I'm<00:02:57.010> gonna<00:02:57.160> show

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you that's you can now put this in here

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.040 
you that's you can now put this in here
and<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:01.060> fix<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.410> um<00:03:03.160> add<00:03:04.150> some

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
and to fix it you just um add some

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.850 
and to fix it you just um add some
diamonds<00:03:06.010> or<00:03:06.600> whatever<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.350> material<00:03:08.740> that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
diamonds or whatever the material that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.760 
diamonds or whatever the material that
your<00:03:09.010> tools<00:03:09.820> made<00:03:10.000> out<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:11.410> can<00:03:11.590> fix

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
your tools made out of and you can fix

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.040 
your tools made out of and you can fix
it<00:03:12.010> back<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.490> full<00:03:13.210> 100%<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.680> obviously<00:03:16.050> you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
it back to full 100% and obviously you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.140 
it back to full 100% and obviously you
can't<00:03:17.530> fix<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.890> if<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.459> already<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
can't fix it if it's already at a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.449 
can't fix it if it's already at a
hundred<00:03:19.360> percent<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.860> that's<00:03:20.980> pretty<00:03:21.250> obvious

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
hundred percent so that's pretty obvious

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.570 
hundred percent so that's pretty obvious
all<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:23.020> beacon<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.650> don't<00:03:24.250> remember<00:03:24.310> exactly

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
all the beacon I don't remember exactly

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.010 
all the beacon I don't remember exactly
when<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.090> introduced<00:03:25.600> um<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.690> just

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
when this is introduced um but just

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.400 
when this is introduced um but just
we'll<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.760> we'll<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:30.790> do<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:32.200> now<00:03:32.350> we

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
we'll just we'll just do that so now we

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.170 
we'll just we'll just do that so now we
gotta<00:03:32.740> get<00:03:33.130> our<00:03:33.190> speed<00:03:33.459> up<00:03:33.670> blah<00:03:33.970> blah<00:03:34.150> blah

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
gotta get our speed up blah blah blah

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.270 
gotta get our speed up blah blah blah
blah<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.660> guys<00:03:34.780> basically<00:03:35.200> no<00:03:35.530> mostly<00:03:36.070> about

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
blah you guys basically no mostly about

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.430 
blah you guys basically no mostly about
that<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.670> now<00:03:37.270> this<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.810> what<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:37.990> think<00:03:38.350> is

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
that and now this is what I think is

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.470 
that and now this is what I think is
really<00:03:38.740> cool<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:39.490> you<00:03:39.580> notice<00:03:39.700> here<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.330> I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
really cool so if you notice here if I

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.040 
really cool so if you notice here if I
click<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:42.459> does<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.330> all<00:03:43.540> right<00:03:43.690> you

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
click this it does that all right you

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.900 
click this it does that all right you
know<00:03:44.170> what<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.590> regular<00:03:44.920> repeater<00:03:45.250> does<00:03:45.459> but

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
know what a regular repeater does but

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.010 
know what a regular repeater does but
now<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.209> haven't<00:03:46.450> circuit<00:03:46.750> coming<00:03:46.930> from

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
now if I haven't circuit coming from

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.340 
now if I haven't circuit coming from
another<00:03:47.140> way<00:03:47.650> look<00:03:48.430> at<00:03:48.550> this<00:03:49.170> look<00:03:50.170> at<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
another way look at this look at this

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.470 
another way look at this look at this
yeah<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.580> can<00:03:51.730> turn<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:52.030> one<00:03:52.090> off<00:03:52.240> and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
yeah and I can turn this one off and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.260 
yeah and I can turn this one off and
this<00:03:52.540> one<00:03:52.690> will<00:03:52.840> still<00:03:53.140> remain<00:03:53.800> lit<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:55.150> this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
this one will still remain lit now this

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.460 
this one will still remain lit now this
is<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.630> honestly<00:03:55.959> think<00:03:56.080> this<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.290> going<00:03:56.380> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
is I honestly think this is going to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.930 
is I honestly think this is going to
have<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> lot<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.830> adventure<00:03:57.280> map<00:03:57.430> makers<00:03:57.790> who

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
have a lot of adventure map makers who

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.080 
have a lot of adventure map makers who
will<00:03:58.090> want<00:03:58.240> to<00:03:58.390> do<00:03:58.450> some<00:03:58.630> really<00:03:58.780> complex

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
will want to do some really complex

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.790 
will want to do some really complex
redstone<00:04:01.090> here<00:04:01.330> because<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.440> honestly

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
redstone here because this is honestly

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.820 
redstone here because this is honestly
really<00:04:03.130> really<00:04:03.430> cool<00:04:03.640> because<00:04:04.090> now<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.770> do

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
really really cool because now if I do

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.699 
really really cool because now if I do
that<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.370> then<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.030> do<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.420> if<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.440> click<00:04:08.650> this

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
that and then I do this if I click this

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.550 
that and then I do this if I click this
lever<00:04:09.070> again<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.610> still<00:04:09.910> lit<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:11.350> if

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
lever again this is still lit so if

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.050 
lever again this is still lit so if
you're<00:04:11.709> doing<00:04:11.950> some<00:04:12.130> type<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.310> crazy<00:04:12.640> door

this that's no longer trip trip wires

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.500 
this that's no longer trip trip wires
um<00:04:26.490> crush<00:04:27.490> your<00:04:27.640> crops<00:04:27.880> or<00:04:28.060> trample<00:04:28.420> your

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
crops and do not trigger pressure plates

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.610 
crops and do not trigger pressure plates
as<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.610> can<00:04:30.760> tell<00:04:30.970> i<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.600> tnt<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.170> there<00:04:32.350> just

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
as you can tell i have tnt in there just

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.590 
as you can tell i have tnt in there just
to<00:04:32.800> show<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.010> guys<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.580> they<00:04:34.210> don't<00:04:34.420> do<00:04:34.570> that

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
to show you guys that they don't do that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.860 
to show you guys that they don't do that
anymore<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.850> think<00:04:36.940> that's<00:04:37.210> acting<00:04:37.720> that's
