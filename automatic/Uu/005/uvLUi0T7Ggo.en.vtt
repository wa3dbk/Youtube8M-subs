00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
like the way my natural hair looks

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
like the way my natural hair looks
better<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:23.100> did<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.430> last<00:00:23.789> summer

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
better now than it did like last summer

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
better now than it did like last summer
with<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.480> old<00:00:24.720> method<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.279> watch<00:00:26.490> that
