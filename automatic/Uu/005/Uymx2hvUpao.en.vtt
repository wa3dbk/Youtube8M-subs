00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
at Lowe's Home Depot stores like that I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.749 
at Lowe's Home Depot stores like that I
found<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> design<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> internet<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
found the design on the internet and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340 
found the design on the internet and
I've<00:00:14.820> modified<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.480> somewhat<00:00:15.839> as<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.199> see

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I've modified it somewhat as you can see

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.480 
I've modified it somewhat as you can see
the<00:00:16.500> tubing<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.550> double<00:00:18.119> stack<00:00:19.189> what<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.310> did

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the tubing is double stack what we did

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.310 
the tubing is double stack what we did
was<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.670> laid<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> tubing<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.539> top<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.020> itself

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
was we laid the tubing on top of itself

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
was we laid the tubing on top of itself
and<00:00:23.359> then<00:00:24.359> welded<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> joint<00:00:25.730> about<00:00:26.730> every<00:00:27.000> 10

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and then welded the joint about every 10

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
and then welded the joint about every 10
inches<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:29.099> makes<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> strong

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I'll run two more stringers across from

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
I'll run two more stringers across from
left<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.640> support<00:01:17.909> the

drilled out to fit this clevis pin just
to<00:02:01.890> bolt<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> middle<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> holds<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> all

to bolt in the middle that holds it all

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.749 
to bolt in the middle that holds it all
together<00:02:03.619> these<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.680> pieces<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.369> made<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
together these are pieces I made out of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.020 
together these are pieces I made out of
a<00:02:06.170> sheet<00:02:07.170> metal<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:08.310> drilled<00:02:08.580> holes<00:02:08.819> in

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
a sheet metal and just drilled holes in

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.319 
a sheet metal and just drilled holes in
it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
it

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.179 
it
pretty<00:02:11.019> simple<00:02:11.379> design<00:02:11.469> but<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:11.890> way<00:02:12.010> that

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
pretty simple design but the way that

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.699 
pretty simple design but the way that
works<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:13.269> can<00:02:13.540> pivot<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> bike<00:02:14.500> can

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
works this can pivot so the bike can

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.539 
works this can pivot so the bike can
move<00:02:14.859> left<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:17.230> hinge<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.189> here

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
move left and right this hinge is here

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.309 
move left and right this hinge is here
so<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.090> trailer<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.629> turn<00:02:19.930> left<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
so that the trailer can turn left and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.179 
so that the trailer can turn left and
right<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:23.019> moves<00:02:23.409> here<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.829> middle

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
right and this moves here in the middle

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.550 
right and this moves here in the middle
so<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.569> trailer<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.079> go<00:02:26.170> up<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.500> down

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
so that the trailer can go up and down

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.410 
so that the trailer can go up and down
the<00:02:26.709> bumps<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.040> hills<00:02:27.280> couldn't<00:02:28.209> give<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.389> a

the bumps and hills couldn't give you a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:40.370 
the bumps and hills couldn't give you a
quick<00:02:28.629> demonstration<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:29.590> my<00:02:29.739> rider<00:02:29.980> here

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
demonstration here couldn't do a circle

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:07.760 
demonstration here couldn't do a circle
for<00:02:54.430> me<00:02:54.580> Logan
