00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
got a little polarizer algata from

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.300 
got a little polarizer algata from
Jessup's<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.689> box<00:00:24.960> isn't<00:00:25.710> normally<00:00:26.130> this

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and so you know the vast majority of

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
and so you know the vast majority of
their<00:00:35.040> boxes<00:00:35.399> well<00:00:35.579> being<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.969> pristine

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
their boxes well being my pristine

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.700 
their boxes well being my pristine
condition<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.079> has<00:00:37.260> been<00:00:37.469> unboxed

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
condition but this has been unboxed

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.880 
condition but this has been unboxed
before<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> say<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
before in but like you say this is a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.260 
before in but like you say this is a
next<00:00:41.280> X<00:00:41.700> display<00:00:42.059> model<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.739> what<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
next X display model so what can you do

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.279 
next X display model so what can you do
and<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:47.120> stops<00:00:48.120> no<00:00:48.329> no<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.989> ever

and so just go it stops no no if I ever
can<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.840> go<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.250> we've<00:00:53.489> got<00:00:53.640> polystyrene

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
can we go and now we've got polystyrene

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.189 
can we go and now we've got polystyrene
yay

there's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> lump<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.380> metal<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.130> glass

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there's a lump of metal with some glass

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.200 
there's a lump of metal with some glass
in<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.920> stock<00:01:52.920> wedged<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> piece<00:01:54.060> of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
in it stock wedged in a piece of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.130 
in it stock wedged in a piece of
polystyrene<00:01:56.299> it's<00:01:57.299> quite<00:01:57.479> heavy<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.869> thought

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
polystyrene it's quite heavy I thought

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.420 
polystyrene it's quite heavy I thought
I'd<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> bit<00:01:58.530> later<00:01:58.710> than<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:58.979> special

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I'd be a bit later than that special

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'd be a bit later than that special
frame<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> guess<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.009> way<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
frame but I guess that's the way it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
frame but I guess that's the way it
doesn't<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.909> doesn't<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
doesn't have is it doesn't have I had to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.050 
doesn't have is it doesn't have I had to
solve<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.189> quite<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> heavy<00:02:05.700> lens

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
solve so it's just quite a heavy lens

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.510 
solve so it's just quite a heavy lens
for<00:02:06.390> its<00:02:06.540> size<00:02:06.810> anyway<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.890> metal<00:02:08.340> Bell

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
for its size anyway but as metal Bell

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.980 
for its size anyway but as metal Bell
and<00:02:08.819> Wow<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and Wow I like that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.790 
and Wow I like that
this<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.770> my<00:02:12.810> second<00:02:13.810> lens<00:02:14.050> if<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.350> exclude

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this is my second lens if you exclude

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.940 
this is my second lens if you exclude
the<00:02:15.750> maquette<00:02:16.750> lens<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.140> got<00:02:17.350> with<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> camera

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
the maquette lens I got with the camera

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.050 
the maquette lens I got with the camera
and<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.130> know<00:02:21.220> again<00:02:21.250> our<00:02:21.550> new<00:02:21.640> lens<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and so you know again our new lens is a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.430 
and so you know again our new lens is a
new<00:02:22.180> experience<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.840> me<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.230> very

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
new experience for me and it's very

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560 
new experience for me and it's very
exciting<00:02:24.190> but<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.670> quite<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.300> feels

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
exciting but this is quite a it feels

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.690 
exciting but this is quite a it feels
quite<00:02:25.750> well<00:02:25.990> made<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> mean<00:02:26.590> I'm<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.400> sure<00:02:27.460> if

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
quite well made I mean I'm not sure if

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.020 
quite well made I mean I'm not sure if
it's<00:02:27.850> male<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.270> think<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.720> um<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.820> yeah

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
it's male but I think is um but yeah

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.940 
it's male but I think is um but yeah

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
we've got the little Canon Annoying cap

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.390 
we've got the little Canon Annoying cap
um<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.770> it's<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.340> just

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
um I don't know it's just it's just

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
um I don't know it's just it's just
annoying<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.060> should<00:02:37.210> probably<00:02:37.390> stick<00:02:37.930> to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
annoying you should probably stick to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.020 
annoying you should probably stick to
what<00:02:38.170> neck<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.280> case<00:02:39.490> samyang

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
what neck on and in this case samyang

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.060 
what neck on and in this case samyang
are<00:02:40.810> doing<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.380> pretty<00:02:41.560> much<00:02:41.680> every<00:02:41.980> other

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
are doing and pretty much every other

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.770 
are doing and pretty much every other
lens<00:02:42.370> brown<00:02:42.640> with<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> little<00:02:42.940> pinchy<00:02:43.390> ones<00:02:43.570> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
lens brown with a little pinchy ones and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.210 
lens brown with a little pinchy ones and
I<00:02:43.810> guess<00:02:43.960> they<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.230> they've<00:02:44.410> caught<00:02:44.590> up<00:02:44.740> now<00:02:44.770> I

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I guess they are they've caught up now I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.470 
I guess they are they've caught up now I
guess<00:02:45.520> but<00:02:45.760> they<00:02:45.910> should<00:02:46.060> have<00:02:46.150> caught<00:02:46.330> on

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
guess but they should have caught on

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.070 
guess but they should have caught on
quite<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> while<00:02:47.140> ago<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.600> there's<00:02:49.780> lanes

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
quite a while ago and so there's lanes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.690 
quite a while ago and so there's lanes
we've<00:02:50.260> got<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.590> nice<00:02:50.850> 1.8<00:02:51.850> Ness<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.700> it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
we've got it's nice 1.8 Ness and it

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.520 
we've got it's nice 1.8 Ness and it
looks<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> more<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.330> 1.4<00:02:56.050> when<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.320> look<00:02:56.440> at

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
looks the more like 1.4 when you look at

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.570 
looks the more like 1.4 when you look at
it<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.710> way<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.100> guess<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.460> just

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
it this way but I guess that's just

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.560 
it this way but I guess that's just
because<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.270> telephoto<00:02:58.810> um<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.450> yeah

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
because it's telephoto um so yeah

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.870 
because it's telephoto um so yeah
there's<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.140> canon<00:03:02.670> 85mm<00:03:03.670> meter<00:03:04.120> 1.8
