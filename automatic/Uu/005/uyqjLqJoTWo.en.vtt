Amin<00:01:10.890> shirt<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.070> minute<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.700> going

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Amin shirt and in a minute you're going

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
Amin shirt and in a minute you're going
to<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.270> many<00:01:17.570> chart<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> Flint<00:01:22.549> basically<00:01:24.770> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to see many chart is Flint basically and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
to see many chart is Flint basically and
so<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.909> mountains<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> North

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so we have mountains in the North

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.300 
so we have mountains in the North
Cascades<00:01:29.450> mountains<00:01:30.450> made<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> Flint<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
Cascades mountains made out of Flint and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.719 
Cascades mountains made out of Flint and
and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.710> original<00:01:34.979> people

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and this is what the original people

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:50.950 
and this is what the original people
knew<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> why<00:01:38.670> they<00:01:38.880> were<00:01:38.939> coming

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.280 

the<00:01:51.960> idea<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.790> Northwest<00:01:53.790> Coast<00:01:54.030> people

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
the idea that Northwest Coast people

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
the idea that Northwest Coast people
really<00:01:55.290> didn't<00:01:55.710> spend<00:01:56.580> much<00:01:56.729> time<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
really didn't spend much time in the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.890 
really didn't spend much time in the
rugged<00:01:58.110> interior<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.160> mountains<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
rugged interior of the mountains and

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.080 
rugged interior of the mountains and
therefore<00:02:00.900> wouldn't<00:02:01.590> even<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.369> accessed

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
therefore wouldn't even have accessed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.710 
therefore wouldn't even have accessed
the<00:02:03.650> tool<00:02:04.650> stone<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.790> places<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
the tool stone in places like the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.550 
the tool stone in places like the
mountains<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> bias<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.810> developed

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
mountains is a bias that developed

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.240 
mountains is a bias that developed
because<00:02:11.540> most<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.959> archaeology<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
because most of the archaeology in the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.270 
because most of the archaeology in the
Northwest<00:02:14.880> Coast<00:02:15.239> has<00:02:15.540> been<00:02:15.570> done<00:02:16.080> close<00:02:17.070> to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
Northwest Coast has been done close to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.050 
Northwest Coast has been done close to
salt<00:02:17.520> water

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.820 

I<00:02:21.150> knew<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.099> could<00:02:23.160> find<00:02:23.900> decent<00:02:24.900> tool

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
I knew that if I could find decent tool

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.420 
I knew that if I could find decent tool
stone<00:02:26.190> material<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.110> mountains<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:29.130> was

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
stone material in the mountains it was

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.540 
stone material in the mountains it was
likely<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.209> been<00:02:30.239> exploited<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.370> once<00:02:32.370> I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
likely to have been exploited and once I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.630 
likely to have been exploited and once I
found<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.180> ribbon<00:02:33.569> shirt<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:35.250> was

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
found the ribbon shirt then it was

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.780 
found the ribbon shirt then it was
immediately<00:02:36.300> obvious<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
immediately obvious that that was the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.960 
immediately obvious that that was the
source<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.330> some<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.470> tools<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.640> was

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
source of some of the tools that I was

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.020 
source of some of the tools that I was
finding<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.569> archaeological<00:02:43.440> sites<00:02:43.819> once<00:02:44.819> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
finding in archaeological sites once I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.140 
finding in archaeological sites once I
found<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.540> first<00:02:45.720> chert<00:02:46.110> quarry<00:02:46.489> then<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
found the first chert quarry then that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:58.740 
found the first chert quarry then that
link<00:02:48.599> became<00:02:50.269> indisputable

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.660 

what's<00:02:59.470> archaeologically<00:03:00.130> significant

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
had the degree wasn't because we as

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.060 
had the degree wasn't because we as
young<00:05:37.330> people<00:05:37.470> didn't<00:05:38.470> show<00:05:38.500> an<00:05:38.770> interest

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
young people didn't show an interest

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.820 
young people didn't show an interest

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
what they're trying to figure out it has

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.920 
what they're trying to figure out it has
provided<00:05:47.919> me<00:05:48.340> with<00:05:48.370> questions<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.240> I've

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.450 

people<00:06:08.030> were<00:06:08.180> here<00:06:09.160> somebody<00:06:10.160> might<00:06:10.400> have

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
people were here somebody might have

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.360 
people were here somebody might have
gotten<00:06:10.639> born<00:06:11.060> here<00:06:11.470> probably<00:06:12.470> somebody<00:06:13.100> got

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
gotten born here probably somebody got

gotten born here probably somebody got
conceived<00:06:13.940> here<00:06:14.800> probably<00:06:15.800> somewhere<00:06:16.250> here

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
conceived here probably somewhere here

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.280 
conceived here probably somewhere here
if<00:06:16.820> it<00:06:17.030> was<00:06:17.240> used<00:06:17.449> for<00:06:17.660> thousands<00:06:18.139> of<00:06:18.199> years

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
if it was used for thousands of years

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.800 
if it was used for thousands of years
somebody<00:06:18.889> died<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.699> got<00:06:19.850> buried<00:06:20.300> but<00:06:20.660> we

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
somebody died and got buried but we

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.629 
somebody died and got buried but we
won't<00:06:21.020> find<00:06:21.290> them<00:06:21.500> because<00:06:21.889> the<00:06:22.040> soils<00:06:22.460> are

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
won't find them because the soils are

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.570 
won't find them because the soils are
too<00:06:22.820> acidic<00:06:23.380> so<00:06:24.380> you<00:06:25.010> know<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.160> want<00:06:25.460> to

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
too acidic so you know you want to

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.930 
too acidic so you know you want to
reconstruct<00:06:26.419> that<00:06:26.780> whole<00:06:27.199> life<00:06:27.620> history<00:06:28.220> that

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
reconstruct that whole life history that

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.560 
reconstruct that whole life history that
is<00:06:29.270> in<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.199> ground<00:06:30.410> this<00:06:31.040> place<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.760> of

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.950 
course you're going to be largely
unsuccessful<00:06:34.190> because<00:06:35.180> all<00:06:35.330> you've<00:06:35.510> got<00:06:35.780> is
