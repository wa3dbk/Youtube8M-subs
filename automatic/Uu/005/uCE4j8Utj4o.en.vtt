00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
I think that are a way to make it better

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.809 
I think that are a way to make it better
could<00:04:58.900> be<00:04:58.930> if<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.469> make<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.039> scratchy<00:05:00.550> card

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
could be if you make it a scratchy card

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.659 
could be if you make it a scratchy card
or<00:05:00.969> something<00:05:01.389> like<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:02.139> then<00:05:03.009> you<00:05:03.250> pick
