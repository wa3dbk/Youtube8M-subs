00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.360
 you want to learn some of the tricks 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.010
 of these beauties the truth is that no 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.900
 has many let's learn how to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.540
 put the false sizes very fast 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 let's do it with mariluz a star 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.529
 very pretty guest 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.070
 let's remove the tab on one side 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.220
 so as not to damage it 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 We are going to measure it in the eyelid 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's measure it 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.929
 to see how much you have to cut 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.460
 and what comes out of the eyelid is what 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.460
 let's cut 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.930
 let's apply the glue only 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.950
 in the growth of the false eyelash 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.950
 in pure needlework 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.079
 let's avoid the surpluses of 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.550
 glue 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.170
 to prevent him from entering the home 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.700
 we have to wait for it to dry 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.660
 little the glue to adhere to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.660
 a faster way 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.570
 we put it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 sticking it only in the middle of the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.620
 eyelid 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.660
 let's wait for it to dry 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.710
 completely good to prevent it from 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.710
 take off the sides 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.110
 we press towards dad so he 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.760
 adhere completely well and we continue 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760
 to accommodate the edges 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.580
 you accommodate the side 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.580
 and continues is to accommodate the tear 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.400
 and once already stuck to our tab 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.869
 you have to match the tear to the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.620
 false eyelash so you can not see 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.290
 no tab start one of these 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 You can do tricks very fast 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.610
 just that you have to have a lot of practice 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.250
