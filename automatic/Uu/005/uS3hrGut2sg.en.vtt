to beat the roulette table hmm what's a
surefire<00:01:02.789> way<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:04.290> move

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.390 

go<00:01:08.640> ahead<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.120> talk<00:01:09.360> oh<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
go ahead and talk oh well it's the it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.220 
go ahead and talk oh well it's the it
depends<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.940> equalization<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.570> ratios<00:01:12.960> uh

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
depends on the equalization of ratios uh

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.770 
depends on the equalization of ratios uh
it's<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> old<00:01:14.220> equalization<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.120> ratio<00:01:15.479> bid<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's the old equalization of ratio bid a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's the old equalization of ratio bid a
right<00:01:16.350> yeah<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.800> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

go<00:01:17.790> ahead<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.870> it's<00:01:19.320> equal<00:01:19.890> things<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
go ahead well it's equal things are you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.250 
go ahead well it's equal things are you
know<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.479> put<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:21.870> let<00:01:22.080> me<00:01:22.140> show

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
know when you put them here let me show

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.690 
know when you put them here let me show
you<00:01:23.330> first<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.830> take<00:01:25.830> seat<00:01:26.490> two

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you first of all you take seat two

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.000 
you first of all you take seat two
glasses<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.360> same<00:01:27.570> amount<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.590> bowl<00:01:28.770> see

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
glasses the same amount in a bowl see

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.400 
glasses the same amount in a bowl see
and<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.270> equal<00:01:30.450> amounts<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.050> them<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
and they have equal amounts in them and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.540 
and they have equal amounts in them and
therefore<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> same<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.430> each

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
therefore they are the same as each

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.160 
therefore they are the same as each
other<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.240> they're<00:01:33.750> different<00:01:33.930> here

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
other see well they're different here

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
other see well they're different here
you<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you take this one and you take this and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.920 
you take this one and you take this and
you'll<00:01:35.940> see<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> drink<00:01:36.660> together

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you'll see that if you drink together

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.820 
you'll see that if you drink together
and<00:01:37.020> you'll<00:01:37.140> find<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.440> they<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.619> unequal

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
and you'll find that they are unequal

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.950 
and you'll find that they are unequal
and<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.580> when<00:01:38.700> they're<00:01:38.880> unequal<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and that when they're unequal that the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
and that when they're unequal that the
ratios<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:40.680> longer<00:01:40.860> equalized<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.790> here

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
ratios can no longer equalized now here

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
ratios can no longer equalized now here
have<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:44.100> of
