a civilization that has not yet

a civilization that has not yet
discovered<00:00:37.340> navigation<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> very

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
discovered navigation or at the very

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.160 
discovered navigation or at the very
least<00:00:39.270> astronomy<00:00:41.360> but<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.660> point<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
least astronomy but at this point is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.440 
least astronomy but at this point is
hard<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> tell<00:00:43.770> what's<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> an

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
hard to tell what's there is it an

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.340 
hard to tell what's there is it an

we'll<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> shortly<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:55.230> definitely<00:00:55.739> want

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we'll see you shortly we definitely want

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.029 
we'll see you shortly we definitely want
to<00:00:56.100> settle<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> nearest<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> us<00:00:58.039> before

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
to settle what is nearest to us before

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
to settle what is nearest to us before
anyone<00:00:59.550> else<00:00:59.640> does<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:01.469> means<00:01:01.680> more

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
anyone else does because that means more

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.840 
anyone else does because that means more
threats<00:01:02.340> around<00:01:02.520> us<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.289

see what we have here looks like a small
island<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> goes<00:01:16.979> any<00:01:17.939> longer

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
island I don't think it goes any longer

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.649 
island I don't think it goes any longer
than<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.200> end<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.000> will<00:01:21.000> plop<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:22.130> um

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
than the end there so will plop down um

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.210 
than the end there so will plop down um
well<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.780> everyone<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.380> pop<00:01:25.619> down<00:01:25.890> the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
progressively further and further away

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.900 
progressively further and further away
and<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.380> will<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.709> our<00:03:21.920> caravels<00:03:22.370> longer<00:03:22.730> and

harbor in my other LP it was one large
continent<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:30.210> look<00:05:31.210> at<00:05:31.330> that<00:05:31.479> were<00:05:31.690> only<00:05:31.840> eight

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
continent a look at that were only eight

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.200 
continent a look at that were only eight
on<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.440> list<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.860> happiest<00:05:33.250> nations<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:34.000> Greeks

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
on a list of happiest nations the Greeks

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.950 
on a list of happiest nations the Greeks
were<00:05:34.449> second<00:05:34.900> those<00:05:35.800> bastards<00:05:36.630> but<00:05:37.630> we'll<00:05:37.750> get

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
were second those bastards but we'll get

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.010 
were second those bastards but we'll get
him<00:05:38.020> don't<00:05:38.320> worry<00:05:38.470> we'll<00:05:38.979> get<00:05:39.159> him<00:05:39.720> as<00:05:40.720> I<00:05:40.750> was

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
him don't worry we'll get him as I was

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.930 
him don't worry we'll get him as I was
saying<00:05:41.050> my<00:05:41.380> other<00:05:41.560> LP<00:05:41.979> it<00:05:42.220> was<00:05:42.400> all<00:05:42.639> one<00:05:42.909> big

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
saying my other LP it was all one big

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.010 
saying my other LP it was all one big
continent

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
continent

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.689 
continent
so<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> didn't<00:05:44.889> really<00:05:44.919> have<00:05:45.099> to<00:05:45.310> worry<00:05:45.490> too

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
so I didn't really have to worry too

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.960 
so I didn't really have to worry too
much<00:05:45.729> about<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.810> sea<00:05:47.050> or<00:05:47.259> navigation<00:05:47.710> this<00:05:48.669> LP

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
much about the sea or navigation this LP

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.129 
much about the sea or navigation this LP
is<00:05:49.479> exactly<00:05:50.259> the<00:05:50.500> absent<00:05:51.060> it's<00:05:52.060> all<00:05:52.300> about<00:05:52.569> the

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
is exactly the absent it's all about the

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.119 
is exactly the absent it's all about the
ocean<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.919> settling<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.699> exploring<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.650> we

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
ocean and settling and exploring so we

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:58.800 
ocean and settling and exploring so we
have<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.460> rely<00:05:57.699> on<00:05:57.729> harbors<00:05:58.300> like<00:05:58.539> we<00:05:58.690> never

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
have to rely on harbors like we never

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.640 
have to rely on harbors like we never
did<00:05:59.080> before<00:05:59.849> because<00:06:00.849> with<00:06:01.060> harbors<00:06:01.650> that's

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
did before because with harbors that's

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.899 
did before because with harbors that's
how<00:06:02.919> we<00:06:02.979> transfer<00:06:03.610> goods<00:06:03.879> between<00:06:05.310> cities<00:06:06.310> on

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
how we transfer goods between cities on

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.439 
how we transfer goods between cities on
different<00:06:07.750> islands<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.139> continents<00:06:09.449> it's

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
different islands and continents it's

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.999 
different islands and continents it's
the<00:06:10.569> only<00:06:10.750> way<00:06:10.870> we<00:06:11.110> can<00:06:11.229> get<00:06:11.379> that<00:06:11.530> source<00:06:11.860> of

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
the only way we can get that source of

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.820 
the only way we can get that source of
iron<00:06:12.240> connected<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:14.289> our<00:06:15.099> homeland<00:06:16.830> alright

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
iron connected to our homeland alright

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.930 
iron connected to our homeland alright
let's<00:06:18.449> toss<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.479> few<00:06:19.780> more<00:06:19.990> guys<00:06:20.199> on<00:06:20.229> there

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.540 

we're<00:06:24.940> going<00:06:25.090> to<00:06:25.180> have<00:06:26.069> plenty<00:06:27.069> of<00:06:27.190> cities

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
we're going to have plenty of cities

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.070 
we're going to have plenty of cities
there<00:06:27.819> we're<00:06:28.000> really<00:06:28.210> getting<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.569> head

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
there we're really getting the head

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.589 
there we're really getting the head

exactly how about over here to the tip
of<00:06:45.099> that<00:06:45.159> island<00:06:46.080> he<00:06:47.080> doesn't<00:06:47.349> look<00:06:47.440> too

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
of that island he doesn't look too

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.589 
of that island he doesn't look too
promising<00:06:47.770> right<00:06:48.219> now<00:06:48.400> but<00:06:49.240> it's<00:06:49.360> a<00:06:49.419> pretty

good strategic location besides we'll

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.529 
good strategic location besides we'll

cultural<00:07:01.330> improvements<00:07:01.870> because<00:07:01.990> it<00:07:02.349> was

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
cultural improvements because it was
