00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.730
 in a tutorial in which I will teach you 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.020
 How to play 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.000
 resident level 123 that is to all of 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 playstation on your android device 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.150
 first of all they should go to the link of 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.130
 download that I will leave you in the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.970
 description which is hosted in 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.849
 mediafire this I started more activator vi 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.770
 the remedy we download what the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.050
 compressed and we passed it directly to 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.360
 our device 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.690
 I have to clarify first that only 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.930
 you need to be nothing else if you're not root 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.670
 this emulator can not do it and now 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.469
 we go to the device 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.210
 already being inside the device we 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 let's direct to the folder where 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 we keep the tablet 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.969
 we open it 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.660
 and we will go to install the emulator 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.310
 we install it but we give it to realized 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.160
 now we will install the activator 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.600
 and we give to open 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.760
 we give him patching and he will ask us 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.479
 authorization to upload user we give 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.479
 authorize 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 and we give it back patching 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.009
 and now we're headed to the emulator 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.659
 and start downloading the plugins from 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.659
 video and audio needed 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.760
 will ask us for the selected language 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.799
 Spanish obviously will not do games 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.240
 originals of good I agree not 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.740
 auto scan sd card we give to ok 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.740
 and start scanning 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.490
 now I will show you how to download the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.310
 games 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 and then just play 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.090
 and good friend already back in the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.550
 desktop we will go to the link and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 I told them in the description of the video 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.670
 this page called cool rom contains 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
 many files made of games 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
 playstation or not already inside us 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.540
 we will direct to sony round files 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.599
 Play Station 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.599
 and as you can see here are the top 50 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 the download number spoken but 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.460
 we went to download a resident 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.070
 we go to the letter r 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.930
 and as you can see they are newly evil 2 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.930
 disco one fresh 3 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.950
 as you can see 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.890
 Most games are hosted 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.290
 in this page pyrenair in bin files 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.209
 it happens but it's the same as an image 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.930
 did so just need to place it on 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.830
 a folder and transfer them to the cell phone now 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.720
 we go again to the device 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.380
 back inside the device we 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.320
 we direct to the compressed file 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.320
 we will open and decompress the bios 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.469
 we chose a route where 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.370
 unzip it in my case to choose 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:36.510
 the memory card ok ok and now we 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 we direct the emulator 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 and we're going to tear God 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.770
 and we select the file 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.849
 and now it only remains to play 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.599
