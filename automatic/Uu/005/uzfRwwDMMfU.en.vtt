often<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.170> will<00:00:01.439> be<00:00:01.589> asked<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.370> find<00:00:03.200> which

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
often you will be asked to find which

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.930 
often you will be asked to find which
between<00:00:04.620> which<00:00:04.770> two<00:00:05.009> whole<00:00:05.250> numbers<00:00:05.640> or

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
between which two whole numbers or

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.450 
between which two whole numbers or
consecutive<00:00:06.690> whole<00:00:06.839> numbers<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.460> these

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
consecutive whole numbers are these

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.379 
consecutive whole numbers are these
square<00:00:09.269> roots<00:00:09.300> or<00:00:09.780> any<00:00:10.110> square<00:00:10.440> root<00:00:10.650> between

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
square roots or any square root between

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.079 
square roots or any square root between
what<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.450> they<00:00:12.570> mean<00:00:12.780> well<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> find

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
what do they mean well we want to find

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.599 
what do they mean well we want to find
two<00:00:15.389> whole<00:00:15.630> numbers<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.230> approximate<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
two whole numbers that approximate this

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.320 
two whole numbers that approximate this
square<00:00:18.330> root<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> well<00:00:20.330> 17

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
square root how do we do that well 17

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.859 
square root how do we do that well 17
the<00:00:21.960> square<00:00:22.199> root<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> 17<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.070> above<00:00:23.670> 4<00:00:24.359> how<00:00:24.810> do

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the square root of 17 is above 4 how do

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.040 
the square root of 17 is above 4 how do
I<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.080> well<00:00:25.590> 4<00:00:25.980> squared<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:27.090> too<00:00:27.390> small<00:00:27.689> it's

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I know well 4 squared is too small it's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
I know well 4 squared is too small it's
16<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.160> 17<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.699> above<00:00:29.939> 16<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.810> 4<00:00:31.109> squared<00:00:31.470> +<00:00:31.710> 4

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
16 and 17 is above 16 so 4 squared + 4

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.150 
16 and 17 is above 16 so 4 squared + 4
is<00:00:32.969> too<00:00:33.390> small<00:00:33.860> well<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.219> about<00:00:35.450> 5<00:00:36.450> squared

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
is too small well what about 5 squared

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.180 
is too small well what about 5 squared
well<00:00:38.160> 5<00:00:38.430> squared<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.940> 25<00:00:39.110> right<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:41.040> does

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
well 5 squared is 25 right what does

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.750 
well 5 squared is 25 right what does
that<00:00:41.219> mean

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that mean

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.380 
that mean
well<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> means<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.750> 5<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.980> too<00:00:44.550> large<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
well that means that 5 is too large of a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.470 
well that means that 5 is too large of a
root<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> 17<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.430> say<00:00:47.670> between

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
root for 17 so when they say between

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
root for 17 so when they say between
which<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:48.989> consecutive<00:00:49.530> whole<00:00:50.430> numbers<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
which two consecutive whole numbers is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
which two consecutive whole numbers is
this<00:00:51.480> square<00:00:51.750> root<00:00:51.899> between<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.219> right

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this square root between this one right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
this square root between this one right
here<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> square<00:00:54.000> root<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> loops<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.320> square

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
here and square root of loops the square

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.770 
here and square root of loops the square
root<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> 17<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:57.750> could<00:00:57.899> say<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.289> between<00:00:58.579> for

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
root of 17 we could say it's between for

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.640 
root of 17 we could say it's between for
between<00:01:01.039> 4<00:01:02.039> &amp;<00:01:02.340> 5<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:04.019> could<00:01:04.170> say<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> even

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
between 4 &amp; 5 you could say it's even

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
between 4 &amp; 5 you could say it's even
closer<00:01:04.920> than<00:01:05.070> 4<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.700> 16<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.210> closer<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> 17

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
closer than 4 because 16 is closer to 17

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620 
closer than 4 because 16 is closer to 17
and<00:01:07.439> 25<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:08.850> numbers<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.270> consecutive

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and 25 but these numbers are consecutive

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.670 
and 25 but these numbers are consecutive
meaning<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.860> after<00:01:11.340> another<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.590> about

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
meaning one after another so what about

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.280 
meaning one after another so what about
this<00:01:13.909> square<00:01:14.909> root<00:01:15.090> between<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.049> two

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this square root between which two

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
this square root between which two
consecutive<00:01:17.130> whole<00:01:17.520> numbers<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.270> square

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
consecutive whole numbers is this square

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800 
consecutive whole numbers is this square
root<00:01:18.780> well<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.720> know

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
root well what about what do we know

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.410 
root well what about what do we know
about<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> thousand<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
about a thousand well we know that that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
about a thousand well we know that that
if<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.509> take<00:01:24.950> 30<00:01:25.950> times<00:01:26.490> 30<00:01:27.590> let's<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
if I take 30 times 30 let's think of it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.060 
if I take 30 times 30 let's think of it
like<00:01:29.340> 3<00:01:29.579> times<00:01:29.820> 3<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.270> 9<00:01:30.530> well<00:01:31.530> 30<00:01:31.799> times

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
like 3 times 3 which is 9 well 30 times

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.940 
like 3 times 3 which is 9 well 30 times
30<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.790> hundred<00:01:33.299> times<00:01:33.479> larger<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.229> 900

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
30 is a hundred times larger it's 900

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
30 is a hundred times larger it's 900
that's<00:01:35.340> too<00:01:35.610> small<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.780> means<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.259> 30

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that's too small so this means that 30

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.710 
that's too small so this means that 30
squared<00:01:38.600> which<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.780> 900<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.420> less<00:01:42.420> than<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
squared which is 900 is less than a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
squared which is 900 is less than a
thousand<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.530> 30<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> too<00:01:44.369> small

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
thousand so 30 is too small

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.170 
thousand so 30 is too small
what<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.700> 31<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.960> guessing<00:01:49.409> here

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
what about 31 here just guessing here

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
what about 31 here just guessing here
well<00:01:51.180> 31<00:01:51.899> squared<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.040> plug<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.909> i<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.090> get

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
well 31 squared I plug it in i would get

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.440 
well 31 squared I plug it in i would get
961<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.740> too<00:01:56.100> small<00:01:56.540> what<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.860> 32<00:01:58.860> squared

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
961 also too small what about 32 squared

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.760 
961 also too small what about 32 squared
well<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.689> work<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.170> 32<00:02:01.939> times<00:02:02.939> 32<00:02:03.770> 2

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
well we can work this out 32 times 32 2

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.089 
well we can work this out 32 times 32 2
times<00:02:05.009> 2<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.280> 4<00:02:05.430> 2<00:02:06.000> times<00:02:06.240> 3<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.540> 6<00:02:06.659> add<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> 0

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 add a 0

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889 
times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 add a 0
because<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.580> we're<00:02:08.819> dealing<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.090> 30<00:02:09.599> times

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because now we're dealing with 30 times

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.550 
because now we're dealing with 30 times
2<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.560> 60<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.310> 3<00:02:12.300> times<00:02:12.510> 3<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.870> 9

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
2 which is 60 and 3 times 3 is 9

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
2 which is 60 and 3 times 3 is 9
since<00:02:14.430> that's<00:02:15.200> 4:12<00:02:16.200> one<00:02:17.300> 1024<00:02:18.300> that's<00:02:18.480> bigger

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
since that's 4:12 one 1024 that's bigger

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.920 
since that's 4:12 one 1024 that's bigger
than<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> thousand<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
than a thousand so I know that the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.150 
than a thousand so I know that the
square<00:02:22.200> root<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.380> thousand<00:02:22.860> should<00:02:23.040> be

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
square root of a thousand should be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.970 
square root of a thousand should be
between<00:02:24.080> 32<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:26.330> 31

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
between 32 and 31

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.430 
between 32 and 31
what's<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> closer<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.989> well<00:02:30.989> it's<00:02:31.080> closer<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
what's it closer to well it's closer to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.540 
what's it closer to well it's closer to
32<00:02:32.010> because<00:02:32.690> 1,024<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.290> closer<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> thousand

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
32 because 1,024 is closer to a thousand

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.170 
32 because 1,024 is closer to a thousand
then<00:02:36.170> 961<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> would<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.760> answer<00:02:39.060> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
then 961 so that would be my answer for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.559 
then 961 so that would be my answer for
that<00:02:39.239> one

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
that one

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.980 
that one
all<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.230> hope<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.800> helped
