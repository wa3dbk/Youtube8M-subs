00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
3 on there's not going to be any other

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
3 on there's not going to be any other

it<00:04:07.480> down<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.140> over-exaggerate<00:04:08.500> your

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
it down so if you over-exaggerate your

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.340 
it down so if you over-exaggerate your
movement<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.820> will<00:04:10.060> keep<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.420> on<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.080> target

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
movement it will keep it on the target

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560 
movement it will keep it on the target
but<00:04:12.070> if<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.610> kind<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.820> do<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.090> less<00:04:13.330> i

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
but if you just kind of do it less i

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.420 
but if you just kind of do it less i
found<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.230> i'm<00:04:14.440> getting<00:04:14.830> most<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.100> my<00:04:15.190> shots

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
found that i'm getting most of my shots

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.920 
found that i'm getting most of my shots
on<00:04:15.610> target<00:04:15.640> like<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.299> get<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.480> hang<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
on target like you get the hang of it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.449 
on target like you get the hang of it
and<00:04:17.140> just<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.680> used<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:18.010> doing<00:04:18.130> what<00:04:18.340> i<00:04:18.370> just

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
and just get used to doing what i just

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.729 
and just get used to doing what i just
said<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.630> really<00:04:19.959> not<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.140> hard<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.500> can

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
said it's really not that hard you can

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.050 
said it's really not that hard you can
definitely<00:04:21.010> get<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.160> hang<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:21.760> yeah

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
definitely get the hang of it so yeah

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.850 
definitely get the hang of it so yeah
slapping<00:04:22.570> stuff<00:04:22.660> definitely<00:04:23.050> something<00:04:23.470> i<00:04:23.650> do

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
slapping stuff definitely something i do

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.050 
slapping stuff definitely something i do
not<00:04:24.070> think<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.280> going<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.460> be<00:04:24.490> changed<00:04:24.940> or

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
not think is going to be changed or

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.830 
not think is going to be changed or
don't<00:04:25.360> doesn't<00:04:25.600> need<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.840> be<00:04:25.930> changed

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
don't doesn't need to be changed

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.600 
don't doesn't need to be changed
say<00:04:26.960> guys<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.320> black<00:04:27.650> hat<00:04:27.949> it's<00:04:28.130> basically<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
say guys is black hat it's basically the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.770 
say guys is black hat it's basically the
hacking<00:04:29.000> device<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:29.540> hack

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
hacking device that you can hack

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.750 
hacking device that you can hack
scorestreaks<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.620> think<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:31.400> needs<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.669> be

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
scorestreaks I think this needs to be

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.430 
scorestreaks I think this needs to be
nerfed<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.330> needs<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.660> at<00:04:32.810> least<00:04:32.870> harder

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
nerfed and needs to be at least harder

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.650 
nerfed and needs to be at least harder
to<00:04:33.590> hack<00:04:33.770> scorestreaks<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:35.060> because<00:04:35.360> I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
to hack scorestreaks just because I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.750 
to hack scorestreaks just because I
don't<00:04:36.169> know<00:04:36.350> like<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.740> feel<00:04:37.220> like<00:04:37.310> if<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.520> get<00:04:37.729> a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
don't know like I feel like if I get a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.490 
don't know like I feel like if I get a
score<00:04:38.000> streak<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.419> should<00:04:38.810> be<00:04:38.930> rewarding<00:04:39.350> like

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
score streak it should be rewarding like

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.080 
score streak it should be rewarding like
I<00:04:39.650> don't<00:04:39.710> know<00:04:39.830> if<00:04:40.100> there's<00:04:40.460> like<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.610> limit<00:04:40.940> to

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
I don't know if there's like a limit to

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.460 
I don't know if there's like a limit to
what<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.330> can<00:04:41.419> hack<00:04:41.720> with<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.080> thing<00:04:42.260> I'm
