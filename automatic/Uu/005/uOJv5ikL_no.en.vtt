diary<00:00:25.419> i<00:00:27.610> think<00:00:28.610> it's<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.849> little<00:00:28.970> classier<00:00:29.390> to

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
diary i think it's a little classier to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.770 
diary i think it's a little classier to
call<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.169> don't<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.529> think

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.430 

anyway<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:35.270> realized<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.199> be

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
anyway I realized that it would be

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
anyway I realized that it would be
somewhat<00:00:37.829> obnoxious<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
somewhat obnoxious for me to have a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.310 
somewhat obnoxious for me to have a
theme<00:00:40.469> song<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.250> point<00:00:41.660> when<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.899> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
theme song at this point when I in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.430 
theme song at this point when I in
essence<00:00:43.890> haven't<00:00:44.519> really<00:00:44.879> said<00:00:45.690> anything<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
essence haven't really said anything of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440 
essence haven't really said anything of
value<00:00:46.579> of<00:00:47.579> worse<00:00:48.149> um

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
value of worse um

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.410 
value of worse um
and<00:00:50.020> they<00:00:50.320> haven't<00:00:50.740> actually<00:00:51.100> even<00:00:51.760> talked

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
and they haven't actually even talked

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.620 
and they haven't actually even talked
about<00:00:52.600> myself<00:00:53.020> at<00:00:53.440> all

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
about myself at all

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.750 
about myself at all
thus<00:00:55.290> I<00:00:55.500> suppose<00:00:55.860> making<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
thus I suppose making it more of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.569 
thus I suppose making it more of
commentary<00:00:57.450> than<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.870> vlog

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.320 

but<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.600> know<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:03.010> was<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.489> obnoxious<00:01:03.670> to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
but you know if I was that obnoxious to

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.660 
but you know if I was that obnoxious to
have<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.479> theme<00:01:04.780> song<00:01:05.080> already<00:01:05.670> here's

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
have a theme song already here's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:22.080 
have a theme song already here's
probably<00:01:07.240> what<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.390> would<00:01:07.540> be<00:01:07.570> like

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:39.200 

you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.340 

people<00:01:40.210> ask<00:01:40.479> me<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:42.100> what<00:01:42.820> made<00:01:42.970> me<00:01:43.090> do<00:01:43.299> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
people ask me what what made me do it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.070 
people ask me what what made me do it
what<00:01:44.350> made<00:01:44.530> me<00:01:44.680> turn<00:01:44.860> away

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

sometimes<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.350> tell<00:01:48.860> them

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.170 

it<00:01:51.610> was<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.150> personal<00:01:52.799> decision

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
it was just a personal decision

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.460 
it was just a personal decision
that<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.810> found<00:01:56.080> my<00:01:56.230> own<00:01:56.380> way

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.050 

other<00:01:59.100> times<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.610> blame<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:01.020> doctor<00:02:02.060> tell

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
other times I blame it on my doctor tell

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.770 
other times I blame it on my doctor tell
me<00:02:03.210> he<00:02:03.450> told<00:02:03.720> me<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.870> had<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.200> save<00:02:04.410> myself

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.270 

but<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.470> truth<00:02:08.679> is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
but the truth is

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.910 
but the truth is
being<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.270> vegetarian<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:12.260> does<00:02:12.380> not<00:02:12.560> fit<00:02:12.800> in

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
being a vegetarian just does not fit in

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.030 
being a vegetarian just does not fit in
with<00:02:13.100> my<00:02:13.280> new<00:02:13.459> low<00:02:13.670> carb<00:02:13.940> lifestyle<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
with my new low carb lifestyle and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.520 
with my new low carb lifestyle and
that's<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.580> truth<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:18.709> look<00:02:18.890> at<00:02:19.040> me<00:02:20.410> some<00:02:21.410> of

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that's the truth to look at me some of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.830 
that's the truth to look at me some of
you<00:02:21.650> probably<00:02:21.920> don't<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.760> how<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.180> ended<00:02:23.690> up

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
this being my second vlog I've decided

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.170 
this being my second vlog I've decided
that<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.830> must<00:03:19.250> say<00:03:19.459> something<00:03:19.879> relevant

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that I must say something relevant

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.830 
that I must say something relevant
rather<00:03:20.659> than<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:22.150> re-enacting<00:03:23.150> on<00:03:23.540> things

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
rather than just re-enacting on things

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.539 
rather than just re-enacting on things
which<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.230> what<00:03:24.530> i<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.159> don't<00:03:25.459> know

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
which is what i like to do I don't know

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.580 
which is what i like to do I don't know
if<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.730> noticed<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.269> yet<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.840> perhaps<00:03:27.349> you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
if you noticed that yet but perhaps you
