00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.020
 Hello everyone today I present the cyber 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.770
 shot certainly does not need to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 presentations 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.910
 but I say it in Italian is a spear 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.279
 bailes spa launch boiler from 15 up 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.900
 at 24 mm of 24 must be a lot 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.800
 precise if it wanted to bring 20 41 25 or 26 is 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.660
 very light very light so avoid 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.750
 the classic arm hurt 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.940
 if you make several launches of 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 very light baiting for which 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.100
 reason 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.420
 first of all because it is made of carbon 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 with two rails in carbon and this one 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:00.409
 part and a half empty just to not do 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.409
 contract with the air at the bottom of one 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.260
 tongue in a soft plastic that 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:10.580
 serves to give the final range and for 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.540
 being more precise is a product 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.830
 This one is patented here 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.830
 ergonomic handle 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.870
 today there is a bit of wind though in the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.670
 tests carried out can be reached 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.930
 quietly on the 100 meters also 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.980
 besides we try with some boys and not even a 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
 mona 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.290
 we see the launch as at the beginning of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.870
 they will fall under your feet because like all of them 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.770
 things take a bit of practice though 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.180
 already after a dozen launches he wants it 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 they will go in the right direction 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.380
 it fits so well and launches a lot 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.380
 accurate 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.170
 if they can put it 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.500
 even two or three the result will always be 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.500
 this 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.240
 as you can see this here is extremely 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.460
 precise once he has taken the hand 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:27.220
 is sold with a hard case in 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.670
 tribute is everything here is the cyber shot 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.670
 Hi everyone
