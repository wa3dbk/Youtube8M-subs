00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello to all cohesion 35 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.990
 new announcement video 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.490
 simply in fact I'm explaining to you 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.460
 and conditions in which go 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.480
 take place the slideshow of subscribers 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.800
 so just for those who 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.660
 do not know the principle of the trick 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.369
 what is this cd small slideshow 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.800
 that I put in the form of volley 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.150
 generally there are five six shutters 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.919
 last year I had a lot 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.130
 it was really great people got 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.660
 well mobilized and so in these 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.000
 slideshows actually I put pictures 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 that you send me an email address of 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.960
 pictures of fish so either fish 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.399
 that you hold in your arms is a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.210
 fish you take from your hand 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.160
 do not see that it is you who choose 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.600
 so that's the email address it's always 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.620
 the same it's photo pays every time 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.030
 bidule @ gmail dot com at the level of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.310
 his pictures so me I reserve the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.440
 right to choose or not the photos that 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.200
 I usually put I do not put more than 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.850
 six photos per person simply 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.470
 for there to be room a little for 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.790
 everybody 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.780
 after good if there is someone who 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.490
 send me lots of pictures and that the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.820
 photos are really very beautiful giant 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.909
 puts several but I spread them in 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.500
 different slideshow so if you want 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.420
 that your face appears on youtube 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.290
 it's your choice 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.200
 personally I do not mind 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.510
 blur or put black on your photos 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 it's up to you to do it 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.840
 Besides, if you sent me 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.190
 photos before this video with your 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 face and you do not want your 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 face appear two on send me 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 an emergency mail before I show 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.799
 the next slideshow whose next 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.650
 the slideshow it will be on the 15th I think 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.760
 the time I receive some photos 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.260
 at the level of photos so I do not know 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.659
 not if I repeat myself because it's not 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.159
 obvious to think of everything but I want 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.270
 no dead fish I do not want to 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.770
 weights are damaged 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.170
 of fish roll in the ground and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 it's simply because I value 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 I would not suggest offering content from 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 quality but I want the slideshow 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.219
 is nice and still shows a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.750
 respect for nature and for 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.979
 fish and so I will not put an x 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.900
 are damaged an abused fish etc. 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.069
 here is a death fish will not appear 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.750
 not in the slideshow that's for sure 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.129
 what can i think others ah 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.230
 yes, I would like you to send me 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.390
 also if you can some photos by 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 example of fishing spot landscapes or 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.380
 so for example a ask them on a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.750
 water lily a frog photographing in 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.640
 macro etc so as to be able to do in 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.310
 does the introduction and the credits of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.170
 the video here and then if not at the level 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 slideshows so editing is a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 hostage I'm going to do it will be very 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.500
 simple very sober the important thing is that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.549
 it is clear and pleasant to look at 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 level of music I would put 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.739
 perhaps Royalty-Free Music 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.060
 via youtube or via a music band 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.769
 I do not know yet how I'm going 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.579
 proceed 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.410
 maybe it's a friend of mine who 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.090
 will do music I do not know I see 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.019
 in any case, there is still 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.090
 a few days before the first 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.440
 subscribers slide show and then I hope 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.700
 that you will be as numerous as 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.170
 you mobilize that last time 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700
 because it was really great I 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.239
 received plenty of photos and we were able to 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.400
 do I know more if it's 7 or 10 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.970

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.019
