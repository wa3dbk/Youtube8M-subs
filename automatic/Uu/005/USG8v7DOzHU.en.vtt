we're<00:01:02.710> using<00:01:02.859> in<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:03.309> this<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.850> has<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> pretty

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
we're using in this this is has a pretty

we<00:01:06.670> wanted<00:01:07.000> something<00:01:07.270> around<00:01:07.570> ten<00:01:08.020> ten<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.770> a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
we wanted something around ten ten and a

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.040 
we wanted something around ten ten and a
half<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.250> one<00:01:09.430> compression<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.840> we

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
half to one compression so that we

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.380 
half to one compression so that we
wouldn't<00:01:11.350> have<00:01:11.409> problems<00:01:11.950> with<00:01:12.130> gas<00:01:13.000> when

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
wouldn't have problems with gas when

we're traveling these fish tunes are

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.890 
we're traveling these fish tunes are
hyper<00:01:17.170> eutectic<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.130> means<00:01:18.370> that<00:01:18.670> they're

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
hyper eutectic that means that they're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.530 
hyper eutectic that means that they're
saturated<00:01:19.900> with<00:01:20.110> silicon<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.240> gives<00:01:22.240> them<00:01:22.420> a

saturated with silicon and gives them a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.750 
saturated with silicon and gives them a
low<00:01:22.690> expansion<00:01:23.380> rate<00:01:23.560> but<00:01:23.890> they're<00:01:24.130> almost

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
low expansion rate but they're almost

Jeff's<00:01:32.350> putting<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.950> number<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:33.610> piston

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
Jeff's putting in the number one piston

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.600 
Jeff's putting in the number one piston
right<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:34.570> he's<00:01:35.320> got<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.590> special<00:01:36.100> technique

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
right now he's got a special technique

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.160 
right now he's got a special technique
he<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.090> likes<00:01:37.300> doing<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.630> on<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.960> bench

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
he really likes doing it on the bench

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.929 
he really likes doing it on the bench
because<00:01:39.010> gravity<00:01:39.670> aids<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.330> job

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.349 

and<00:01:43.359> once<00:01:43.600> he<00:01:43.719> gets<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.109> Rings<00:01:44.350> through<00:01:45.359> he

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
and once he gets the Rings through he

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.139 
and once he gets the Rings through he
gives<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:46.659> one<00:01:46.840> good<00:01:47.049> bump<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.759> yeah<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:49.090> is

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
gives you one good bump and yeah this is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.370 

when<00:02:40.090> we're<00:02:40.240> looking<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.660> what<00:02:40.840> two<00:02:41.050> or<00:02:41.080> four

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
when we're looking for what two or four

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.270 

it's<00:02:50.020> important<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.800> engine<00:02:51.099> turn

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
it's important that the engine turn

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
it's important that the engine turn
smoothly<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.360> way<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.290> got<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
smoothly all the way if you got a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.170 
smoothly all the way if you got a
binding<00:02:53.890> situation<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.700> got<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.940> take<00:02:55.060> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
binding situation you got to take the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:04.350 
binding situation you got to take the
whole<00:02:55.330> thing<00:02:55.810> apart<00:02:56.220> looking<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.280> any<00:02:58.530> rings

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.880 

so<00:03:05.360> these<00:03:05.780> heads<00:03:06.349> are<00:03:06.769> Pro<00:03:07.280> Comp<00:03:07.870> electronics

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
so these heads are Pro Comp electronics

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.399 
so these heads are Pro Comp electronics

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
knockoffs of a victor junior head so

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.890 
knockoffs of a victor junior head so
they<00:03:12.709> got<00:03:12.860> 208<00:03:13.790> intake<00:03:14.780> valves<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.500> 160<00:03:16.900> on
