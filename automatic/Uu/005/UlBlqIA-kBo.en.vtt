00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.100
 welcome once more to the channel os 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.040
 I bring a race guys this time 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.189
 it's about motorcycles and it's a kind of racing 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.009
 the truth that I love, I think 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.619
 what they usually call career type is 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.750
 parkour or good some people or 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.940
 creators usually call them type 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.129
 parkour vale are made with bikes and good 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.170
 then you have to go overcoming several 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.940
 obstacles that I have putting the creator 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.580
 and the truth is that this race 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.159
 as not being of big cell then 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.140
 he had to be good guys so 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.860
 we go there today, it's happening, it's happened to me 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.809
 I 've spent my time I've spent a lot 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.350
 ok we started badly we started fatal not 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.729
 be fatal we start very badly we will see 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.949
 see how it ends we're going guys what is it 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.479
 what matters after all to see how 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.350
 we finish 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.940
 silly hands today 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 today I have silly hands guys ya 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.000
 you know the silly hands 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 my mother hands worth dumb guy 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 come on let's go last I really know in addition 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 I do not know what happens to me lately in these 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.620
 careers but 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.720
 again mac I overtook everyone 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.720
 I'm quite duck the truth 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.180
 and that I could not take it easy or 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 I easily caught her 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.570
 no way 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.140
 It's worth, it's worth kids, but if I do not speak 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.409
 It's very much worth knowing that it's 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.300
 is why shit you goal fourth is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 because I'm pretty focused because 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.970
 I want to advance a few positions and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.310
 I do not know if it will be because of that but he told me 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.350
 but every time I speak the cago you see 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.850
 the end is worth so let's make a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.560
 try guys let's do a test 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.870
 live here to see what happens 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.870
 Come the calm event I will not speak 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.930
 you see guys if I do not talk things out 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 It's a bit weird and I miss everything but 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.810
 well do not fall down again with the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.110
 milk damn and now I have to give the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.970
 back again colleague fuck vale beca 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 that everyone is not getting ahead 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.470
 we do not host girl 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 in short guys I have the silly hand the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.050
 silly motorbike it seems that today everything is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 silly 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.730
 where are you going gross 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.520
 and you are clear that it is logical as 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.560
 not good we go there at least in 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.980
 this race guys is not giving me 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.650
 as bad as in others the truth that I 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.380
 is doing pretty well since I was done 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.770
 some and the truth is that they are 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.110
 quite similar and lines the cellar 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.250
 you just take the touch and I'll finish 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.510
 to say that he has just overtaken him 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.849
 doing a bit of cheating some of 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.610
 cheating not because actually in 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.130
 reality guys it has come out of pure 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.930
 coÃ±a not worth here we have to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.340
 crash I guess because there was no 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.620
 no more so there would have to be 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.480
 crashing let's see if we can 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.310
 overtake a few positions though 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 I think not because they are pretty 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.459
 advanced is already too early to 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 me is that you are very good and audios good 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.330
 guys finally someone has finished by 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.130
 there so we just have to finish 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.650
 we guys hope that I have 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.900
 really liked this race 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.060
 I think you liked this guy 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.430
 parkour to me the truth is that they are of the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.319
 motorcycle racing I like not 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.890
 no no no no care care care worth 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.569
 I did not know I knew it and well guys I think 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.340
 that the final is close does not come the final 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.319

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.570
