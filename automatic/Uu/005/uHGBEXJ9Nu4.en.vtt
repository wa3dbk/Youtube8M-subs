00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.679
 episode from the west that video that my 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.059
 series of questions and answers like me 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.570

 previously beauty this first year 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.990
 episode as you did not have many questions 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 I'll get some questions that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.689
 made on twitter that is the criterion of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.750
 c series ask questions on twitter but 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 already as it did not go very well 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
 posted this from there on twitter partner 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.700
 So I'll get some questions. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.430
 that most make me on youtube 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.890
 Alright then let's go 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.879
 my first question is win 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 arizmendi am going to continue in playoff 2 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.000
 if I'm going to continue in box 2 to the safe 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 two goals could be that I play more 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 some games but some cuts and pains 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 but I intend to do is focus on the videos 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 more in box 2 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.409
 Of course when I release this I do not know 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 if other videos of gta but I'm going to play 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.500
 enough because it's an exceptional game I 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 I always like you and I'm really looking forward to it. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.520
 with just that this new launch of the opa 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.350
 to the second question of the leonardo 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.320
 Oliveira 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 How old are you, I'm 17 years old. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 English gift fan 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.409
 the third question again from arizmendi 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.600
 This guy wants to get famous. 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.549
 Um, what are Cof Dorin's favorites ? 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 what are my three in the person of 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 his favorite in which the first 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 the first is am 40 3 because of the son 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.829
 and 4 was basically where I started to 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.320
 play code and then it's not because I'm more 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 I'm very familiar let's say like this 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.510
 I think it's very well, fuck, she's kind of the guy. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.010
 the informality is good if 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:13.870
 So I enjoy it a lot and I found it 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:16.510
 of the world through the intervention of the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 third age of Mr. I do not intend 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.330
 enter dsr to labor 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 but the psr after 77 and stayed on it 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.730
 who had not worn his belt lately 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.340
 the country has not played little jury 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 but I after seven or 10 quite a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.890
 politics getting to play normally 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.070
 with her 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.660
 then it can be a and b 43 beer and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.030
 guarantor the fourth question of be light 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.970
 rock 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.510
 how many pieces of cheesecake by 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.240
 day 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.330
 I think he meant that if you 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.250
 many think there is no short not 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.470
 be to her that I make a hot joint 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.820
 of those heady 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.550
 so this is the most 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.459
 prepared next time the fifth question 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.290
 no leonardo oliveira again 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.590
 where does the idea of making videos in the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.959
 youtube was inspired by someone 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.150
 the idea of ​​making videos on youtube I already 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.540
 I said earlier in the story video 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.120
 of an episode of his story was in the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
 video of a machinage guy I do not know if 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.310
 was ivory but the video was posted on 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.870
 a queue well finally his name 's name 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.630
 he was from the miner organized in a 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.230
 simple twitter message as well 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.209
 but it was cool to watch then and I 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.630
 I was inspired by him at the time 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.430
 make dynamic videos and currently I 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.160
 I have some favorite players but nothing 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.180
 that inspires me to make video I think 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.430
 Now I'm fine alone anyway and it's 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.470
 that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.810
 the other question is of the ricardo he spoke 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.110
 he asked me about my career 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.890
 until the site tram the trajectory so far 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.250
 Sayko, I will not do it, I will not answer. 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.470
 This video is sorry 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.340
 because I think it was a video more 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.530
 elaborate 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.209
 I do not know, I do not know if this will come as 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.610
 a theme in the history of the river 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:31.280
 in the next episode but I think this one 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.960
 this topic in forgotten eat sn 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.720
 let us say a greater emphasis of the 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.820
 that a question and answer video 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:43.250
 Okay, so I'm going to make a video. 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:48.440
 talking about it and it's us there 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:53.030
 ask what we do on youtube to 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.840
 What sensitivity do I use to 14 in 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.010
 score at the age of 20 to 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.050
 play in the team 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.970
 you do not have to use the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.640
 higher mother cities 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.260
 I, for one, like it because you have 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.490
 more mobility than your character 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.830
 can give a workout for example 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.419
 Nobody gets behind your back. 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.130
 in matters such as society is 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.470
 I was in sensitivity and yes 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.030
 completely 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.820
 so that's why sensitivity 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.870
 higher to have more mobility and this 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.270
 is obvious 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.340
 Yes, but it's not mandatory for you to use 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.900
 I know a lot of people who play in 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.970
 smaller towns 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.220
 play as well as I've never played 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:37.550
 Very well, but I do not know, but anyway. 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.729
 another question is what are the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.950
 that you play more in the team 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.220
 I think the ports from the first with 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.860
 the stink and stink spider and 4 they are medium 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.729
 so I do not know how to explain it well 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.979
 room 24 pros games spu the games 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.890
 young people have changed a lot in the 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.430
 can not 46 had very little text 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.220
 street and the tanks were the type was 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.550
 quite a few but things were 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.650
 kept in rituals but knows that the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.669
 Current cuts are much more stated today 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.250
 in 88 and the whole fuck knows if you put a 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.630
 hemp heap in the steaming area is easy 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.270
 but I usually use everything that keeps the 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.230
 my character my soul is fast 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.420
 fundamental law 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:30.230
 we're not because I'm a character 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:35.690
 fast and his weapon has been included 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:38.510
 has a video about the other a tutorial 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.880
 cultural type, then expelled and 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.550
 after the pet that shows a little of the 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.330
 portions of use so if you want to go 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.470
 there we are in the description and it is 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.320
 we 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.780
 good guess thats it the questions were 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.510
 s only know I do not have many 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.670
 interesting questions but if you do not 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.650
 Enjoyed the questions you want to ask. 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.530
 some more interesting questions 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.970
 go there on my twitter and asks why 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.330
 this episode did with some questions 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.970
 from youtube as I already said only that the 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.690
 Intention of the video input level is 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.970
 ask or ask questions on twitter 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.580
 so I'll leave it on the application if you 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.840
 You want to ask a question go and is 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.700
 that's right 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.100
 I wanted to say sorry for the three days in 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.020
 another video is because I caught three fell 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.360
 I was waiting for the fabled assemblies. 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.520
 three cars are all being edited with 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.470
