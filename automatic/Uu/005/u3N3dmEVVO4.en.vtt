00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
views of knuckle lifting and army arms

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.509 
views of knuckle lifting and army arms
and<00:00:07.200> stuff<00:00:07.379> like<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.099> we'll<00:00:08.280> see<00:00:08.429> how<00:00:08.490> it

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
goes it's a bit of a trial and error job

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.720 
goes it's a bit of a trial and error job
so<00:00:11.690> off<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.900> go<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:15.980> met<00:00:16.980> quite<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> big<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.640> this

so off we go I met quite a big one this

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.630 
so off we go I met quite a big one this
is<00:00:17.910> seven<00:00:18.270> power<00:00:18.539> closer<00:00:22.039> to<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> center

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
is seven power closer to the center

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:35.560 
is seven power closer to the center
first<00:00:28.670> pull<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.849> up

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.630 

bring<00:00:36.080> it<00:00:36.230> down

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.119 

both<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.620> four<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.860> inch<00:00:47.010> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
both of it in about four of an inch in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.360 
both of it in about four of an inch in
the<00:00:47.219> bottom<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.519> a<00:00:47.579> fully<00:00:48.000> how

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:04.240 

compress<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.329> best<00:00:52.539> ago

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.210 

just<00:01:04.790> narrow<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.270> little<00:01:05.510> bit<00:01:06.200> what<00:01:07.130> if

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
just narrow it a little bit what if

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.610 
just narrow it a little bit what if
she's<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.400> bit<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.730> a<00:01:07.790> heel<00:01:08.000> lift<00:01:08.330> first

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
she's a bit of a heel lift first

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.010 
she's a bit of a heel lift first
slightly<00:01:09.620> just<00:01:09.830> for<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.010> big<00:01:10.190> blur<00:01:10.810> shoes<00:01:11.810> in

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
slightly just for the big blur shoes in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.990 
slightly just for the big blur shoes in
the<00:01:12.620> heel<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.950> my<00:01:13.010> hand<00:01:13.220> just<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.550> lift<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.880> bit

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the heel of my hand just to lift a bit

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.620 
the heel of my hand just to lift a bit
of<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> thing<00:01:14.420> stuff<00:01:14.660> up<00:01:14.810> there

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.600 

I<00:01:21.220> color<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.490> again<00:01:22.759> squeeze<00:01:23.540> right

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.760 

maybe<00:01:30.060> she's<00:01:30.390> narrative<00:01:30.990> itself<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
maybe she's narrative itself but the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.530 
maybe she's narrative itself but the
public<00:01:32.340> stand<00:01:32.610> against<00:01:32.880> poison

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.890 

so<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:42.230> we'll<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.530> first<00:01:43.480> knuckle<00:01:44.480> lift

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
so now we'll do the first knuckle lift

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.640 
so now we'll do the first knuckle lift
which<00:01:45.700> basically<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.970> hummed<00:01:47.690> inside<00:01:48.080> knuckle

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
which basically is hummed inside knuckle

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.860 
which basically is hummed inside knuckle
under<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.950> bottom<00:01:49.310> let<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.240> Claire<00:01:50.480> flow<00:01:50.750> up

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
under the bottom let the Claire flow up

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.340 
under the bottom let the Claire flow up
that<00:01:51.020> knuckle

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.180 

so<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> girl<00:01:55.130> take<00:01:55.400> me<00:01:55.550> knuckle<00:01:55.850> in<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:57.190> you

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
so a girl take me knuckle in that you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.890 
so a girl take me knuckle in that you
can<00:01:58.310> say<00:01:58.550> Keith<00:01:59.060> um<00:01:59.240> as<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.420> bullet<00:01:59.659> just<00:01:59.750> to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
can say Keith um as a bullet just to

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.440 
can say Keith um as a bullet just to
sort<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.140> something<00:02:00.440> from<00:02:00.560> going<00:02:00.800> outward

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
sort of something from going outward

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.930 
sort of something from going outward
just<00:02:02.450> Paul<00:02:02.900> I<00:02:02.930> got<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.590> lot<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> clay<00:02:04.550> up<00:02:04.670> really

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
just Paul I got a lot of clay up really

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.589 
just Paul I got a lot of clay up really
quickly

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.890 

get<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.989> sublight

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.390 

slowly<00:02:16.900> right<00:02:17.140> down<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.620> was<00:02:17.860> getting<00:02:18.160> taller

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
slowly right down I was getting taller

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.920 
slowly right down I was getting taller
those<00:02:18.760> otherwise<00:02:19.030> I'll<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.570> over<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
those otherwise I'll go all over the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.640 
those otherwise I'll go all over the
place<00:02:20.230> just<00:02:21.210> pull<00:02:22.210> her<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.510> again<00:02:25.560> call<00:02:26.560> her

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
place just pull her in it again call her

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.110 
place just pull her in it again call her
in<00:02:26.710> again<00:02:27.040> from<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> bottom<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.790> might<00:02:27.940> go<00:02:28.090> a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
in again from the bottom it might go a

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:41.610 
in again from the bottom it might go a
little<00:02:28.360> bit<00:02:28.570> wobbly<00:02:29.110> what<00:02:29.380> else<00:02:29.590> uh<00:02:29.710> construal

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
to lube up a bit maybe I am right now

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:00.660 
to lube up a bit maybe I am right now
same<00:02:51.860> thing<00:02:52.160> look<00:02:52.490> like<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.850> bottom

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:10.309 

leftie

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.000 

we<00:03:10.829> need<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.189> be<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> bit<00:03:11.519> taller

I'll<00:03:26.640> just<00:03:26.790> try<00:03:27.170> now<00:03:28.170> falling<00:03:28.709> into<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> bit<00:03:29.160> of

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
I'll just try now falling into a bit of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.750 
I'll just try now falling into a bit of
a<00:03:29.310> pasture<00:03:29.520> there's<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.420> bit<00:03:30.569> wider<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.050> bottle

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
a pasture there's a bit wider the bottle

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.860 
a pasture there's a bit wider the bottle
see<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:32.940> get<00:03:33.090> on

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.130 

to<00:03:36.409> squeeze<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.159> again<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.610> bottom<00:03:38.140> they

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
to squeeze in again at the bottom they

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.160 
to squeeze in again at the bottom they
look<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.349> bit<00:03:39.440> rough<00:03:39.709> until<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> finally

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.910 

share<00:03:43.920> pick<00:03:44.160> properly
