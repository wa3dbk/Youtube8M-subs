so<00:04:48.880> thinking<00:04:49.880> groups<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.270> four<00:04:50.509> and<00:04:50.780> then

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
so thinking groups of four and then

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.080 
so thinking groups of four and then
you'll<00:04:51.470> have<00:04:51.590> sixteen<00:04:52.430> notes<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:52.910> can

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
you'll have sixteen notes so you can

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.520 
you'll have sixteen notes so you can
split<00:04:53.389> it<00:04:53.479> into<00:04:53.720> four<00:04:53.960> sub<00:04:54.229> groups<00:04:54.470> of<00:04:54.680> four

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
split it into four sub groups of four

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.960 
split it into four sub groups of four
then<00:04:57.530> go<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.830> third<00:04:58.070> fret<00:04:58.340> fifth<00:04:58.580> fret<00:04:58.729> and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
then go to the third fret fifth fret and

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.700 
then go to the third fret fifth fret and
seventh<00:04:59.389> fret<00:04:59.599> just<00:05:00.050> hit<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.289> third<00:05:00.470> fret

seventh fret just hit the third fret

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.909 
seventh fret just hit the third fret
twice<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.720> stretch<00:05:03.139> take<00:05:03.470> your<00:05:03.620> thumb

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
twice for that stretch take your thumb

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.890 
twice for that stretch take your thumb
lower<00:05:04.669> it<00:05:04.910> down

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
lower it down

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.480 
lower it down
don't<00:05:06.169> keep<00:05:06.289> it<00:05:06.470> restrict<00:05:07.130> this<00:05:07.340> will

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
don't keep it restrict this will

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.460 
don't keep it restrict this will
restrict<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.300> as<00:05:08.389> far<00:05:08.599> as<00:05:08.630> when<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.199> comes<00:05:09.349> to

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
stretching have that thumb down it frees

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.650 
stretching have that thumb down it frees
up<00:05:11.509> your<00:05:11.690> hand<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.110> do<00:05:12.229> a<00:05:12.259> further<00:05:12.530> stretch

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
then go a fifth fret twice seventh fret

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.370 
then go a fifth fret twice seventh fret
once<00:05:17.930> eighth<00:05:18.289> fret<00:05:19.780> okay<00:05:20.780> so<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.229> whole
