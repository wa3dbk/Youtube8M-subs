00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the action it i think is really good and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.700 
the action it i think is really good and
you're<00:01:15.840> talking<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.080> ridiculous<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you're talking about ridiculous it is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
you're talking about ridiculous it is
and<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.509> don't<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:18.750> anyone

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and it's like I don't get how anyone

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
and it's like I don't get how anyone
could<00:01:19.229> argue<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> point<00:01:20.159> after<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
could argue that point after two and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.140 
could argue that point after two and
three<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.369> we're<00:01:23.549> saying<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
three but that's what we're saying is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
three but that's what we're saying is
like<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.479> don't<00:01:24.659> necessarily<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> get

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
like you don't necessarily want to get

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
like you don't necessarily want to get
worse<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.570> ludicrousness<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
worse you know then the ludicrousness of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
worse you know then the ludicrousness of
two<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.250> three<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.939> feel<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.229> sort

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
two or three and I feel like we all sort

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
two or three and I feel like we all sort
of<00:01:31.530> begrudgingly<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.729> three<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.630> everyone

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
of begrudgingly like three but everyone

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
of begrudgingly like three but everyone
would<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.290> preferred<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> movie<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> tried

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
try to enjoy for what it was but it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530 
try to enjoy for what it was but it's
like<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.860> poorly<00:01:56.159> had<00:01:56.759> together<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
