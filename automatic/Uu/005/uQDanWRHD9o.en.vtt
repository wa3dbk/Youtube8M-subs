commando<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.329> two-player<00:02:22.750> game<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
commando is a two-player game but the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.390 
commando is a two-player game but the
two-player<00:02:25.299> mode<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.900> alternating<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.250> it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
two-player mode is alternating so it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.990 
two-player mode is alternating so it's
not<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.579> simultaneous<00:02:28.560> two-player<00:02:29.560> shooter

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
not a simultaneous two-player shooter

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.460 
not a simultaneous two-player shooter
which<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.329> stinks<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.810> two-player

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
which kind of stinks a two-player

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.850 
which kind of stinks a two-player
simultaneous<00:02:32.980> version<00:02:33.910> would<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
simultaneous version would be I think a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.979 
simultaneous version would be I think a
little<00:02:35.980> better<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.519> version<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.570> the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
little better of a version but the

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.069 
little better of a version but the
arcade<00:02:38.350> wasn't<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.769> way<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:40.750> kept<00:02:40.959> it

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
arcade wasn't that way and they kept it

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.120 
arcade wasn't that way and they kept it
true<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.500> arcade<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.160> way<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.980> are

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
true to the arcade that way you are

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.210 
true to the arcade that way you are

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
semi-automatic so you have to keep

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.479 
semi-automatic so you have to keep

that far

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.089 
that far
it's<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.140> depressing<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:01.739> might<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.040> to

it's kind of depressing it might have to

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's kind of depressing it might have to
do<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> fact<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:03.150> bullets<00:03:03.420> are

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
do with the fact that your bullets are

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.309 
do with the fact that your bullets are
the<00:03:03.599> size<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.019> baseballs<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:07.050> guess

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
the size of baseballs and I guess

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.420 
the size of baseballs and I guess
gravity<00:03:07.709> affects<00:03:07.950> them<00:03:08.069> rather<00:03:08.220> quickly<00:03:10.430> and

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360 
fun and I also remember playing it at
home<00:04:44.900> on<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.140> NES<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.950> remember<00:04:46.220> thinking

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
home on the NES and I remember thinking

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.650 
home on the NES and I remember thinking
that<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.700> was<00:04:46.850> great<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> could<00:04:47.300> play<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.570> at

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
that it was great I could play it at

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.020 
that it was great I could play it at
home<00:04:47.810> because<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.169> was<00:04:48.230> identical<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:49.160> the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
home because it was identical to the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.260 
home because it was identical to the
arcade<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.570> didn't<00:04:50.840> spend<00:04:51.110> quarters<00:04:52.240> but<00:04:53.240> I

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
arcade and I didn't spend quarters but I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.080 
arcade and I didn't spend quarters but I
must<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:54.560> retrospect<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.490> think<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:55.910> needed

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
must have in retrospect I think I needed

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.430 
must have in retrospect I think I needed
a<00:04:56.240> new<00:04:56.419> pair<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.600> glasses<00:04:56.780> or<00:04:57.140> something

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
a new pair of glasses or something

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.250 
a new pair of glasses or something
because<00:04:57.560> it's<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:58.120> quite<00:04:59.120> poor<00:04:59.960> looking

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.070 
compared to the arcade but still not as
bad<00:05:03.950> as<00:05:04.070> other<00:05:04.220> ports<00:05:04.850> of<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.660> game<00:05:05.870> was<00:05:06.020> a

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
bad as other ports of it this game was a

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.430 
bad as other ports of it this game was a
portal<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:07.040> many<00:05:07.310> many<00:05:07.550> systems<00:05:08.440> including

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
portal of many many systems including

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.320 
portal of many many systems including
the<00:05:09.560> Atari<00:05:09.919> 2600<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.940> Intellivision

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.800 
the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision
system<00:05:11.930> so<00:05:12.860> I'm<00:05:13.340> sure<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.850> versions<00:05:14.600> of

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
system so I'm sure the versions of

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.340 
system so I'm sure the versions of
commando<00:05:15.410> for<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.070> Atari<00:05:16.400> 2600<00:05:16.880> are<00:05:17.350> probably

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
commando for the Atari 2600 are probably

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.030 
commando for the Atari 2600 are probably
pretty<00:05:18.620> deplorable<00:05:20.530> I'll<00:05:21.530> have<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.710> pick<00:05:21.860> up<00:05:21.950> a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
pretty deplorable I'll have to pick up a

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.190 
pretty deplorable I'll have to pick up a
copy<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.430> give<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:22.970> review<00:05:23.120> here<00:05:23.540> but<00:05:24.169> I

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
copy and give it a review here but I

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.630 
copy and give it a review here but I
don't<00:05:24.320> currently<00:05:24.620> have<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.979> copy<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.490> for

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
don't currently have a copy of it for

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.180 
don't currently have a copy of it for
the<00:05:25.729> Atari<00:05:26.450> 2600<00:05:26.990> or<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.500> Intellivision

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
the Atari 2600 or the Intellivision

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.430 
the Atari 2600 or the Intellivision
system<00:05:31.210> so<00:05:32.210> yeah<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.660> definitely<00:05:33.169> recommend

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.350 
commando for the NES but I don't know if
I<00:05:35.660> could<00:05:35.840> do<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.110> same<00:05:36.729> or<00:05:37.729> say<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.120> same<00:05:38.330> for

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
I could do the same or say the same for

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.330 
I could do the same or say the same for
the<00:05:39.020> other<00:05:39.169> ports<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.830> I'll<00:05:39.979> have<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.220> give

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340
