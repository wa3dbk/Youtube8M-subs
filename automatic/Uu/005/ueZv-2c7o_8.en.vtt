00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
all this you do a solid stutter step

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.319 
all this you do a solid stutter step
Juke<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> hit<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.789> without<00:00:50.940> with

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Juke and then you hit them without with

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
Juke and then you hit them without with
a<00:00:51.360> quick<00:00:51.719> spin<00:00:52.110> move<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.340> left<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
a quick spin move to the left or to the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
a quick spin move to the left or to the
right<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.350> crazy<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and see it run smooth and fluid you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
and see it run smooth and fluid you
could<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.000> FIFA<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
could do that with FIFA it's just that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
could do that with FIFA it's just that
you're<00:01:02.129> playing<00:01:02.280> soccer<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.600> saying

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you're playing soccer you know saying

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
you're playing soccer you know saying
you<00:01:04.049> can't<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.040> mattin<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can't do that in mattin because the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
you can't do that in mattin because the
game<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> game<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.619> jerky<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
game is so is the game is so jerky and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820 
game is so is the game is so jerky and
in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> animation<00:01:09.570> selection<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.590> limited

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
in the animation selection is so limited

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.820 
in the animation selection is so limited
you<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.240> happen<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.680> I'm

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

you don't have that happen you know I'm
saying<00:01:14.100> everybody<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> running<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.479> axis

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
saying everybody is running on an axis

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
saying everybody is running on an axis
there<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> no<00:01:16.470> true<00:01:16.740> foot<00:01:17.130> planting<00:01:17.670> dynamic

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
there is no true foot planting dynamic

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
there is no true foot planting dynamic
that's<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.470> need<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> feat<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's what they need from this feat for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's what they need from this feat for
dev<00:01:21.060> team<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.600> why<00:01:21.750> foot<00:01:22.380> planting<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
dev team that's why foot planting and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.539 
dev team that's why foot planting and
football<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.509> major<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.220> saying

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
football is is major you know I'm saying

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.600 
football is is major you know I'm saying

its major you know like that's like
white<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.939> rice<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.710> has

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
white on rice you know like it just has

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.149 
white on rice you know like it just has
to<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
to be there like it has to be there and

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
to be there like it has to be there and
it's<00:01:35.159> missing<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.930> added<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's missing but if they added this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's missing but if they added this
element<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> mighty<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:39.360> way

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
element this would go a mighty long way

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
element this would go a mighty long way
in<00:01:39.900> terms<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.409> both<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:41.009> games<00:01:41.340> taking

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
in terms of both of those games taking

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
in terms of both of those games taking
that<00:01:42.180> step<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.110> direction<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that step in the right direction of

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.800 
that step in the right direction of
truly<00:01:44.220> having<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.759> sound<00:01:45.149> football<00:01:45.960> game<00:01:46.460> but

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
truly having a sound football game but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810 
truly having a sound football game but
moving<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> point<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.250> said<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
moving on from that point and I said you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
moving on from that point and I said you
just<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> gameplay<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.110> gameplay<00:01:52.350> will

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
just see the gameplay the gameplay will

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.100 
just see the gameplay the gameplay will
speak<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.579> itself<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
speak all for itself but this is the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.069 
speak all for itself but this is the
second<00:01:55.560> point<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:57.020> all<00:01:58.020> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
MLB 12 the show you see how they're

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.480 
MLB 12 the show you see how they're
using<00:02:59.370> dynamic<00:03:00.180> physics<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.280> terms<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.370> the
