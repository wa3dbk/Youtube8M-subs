00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.680
 Now, bubbling ahead is easy with 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.550
 all 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 is a world of its own 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.340
 endless part of the say 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 you can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.629
 mercedes slk 55 amg a power plant on 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.699
 Four wheels packed in a tailored suit 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.299
 balancing source of a joy 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.520
 five and a half liter big v8 downright 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.520
 beguiling the sound of his four methods 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.290
 the six-cylinder competition works 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 in contrast, the boys choir 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.670
 dogs biting the bark do not say one 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.890
 the permanent smoke development at the rear 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.460
 the slk speaks a different language 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 below the very open 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 We're just getting started 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.350
 we come to the data 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.650
 the top speed will be at 250 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.240
 km h electronically limited the sprint 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.210
 on 100 is after 49 seconds 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.160
 Past 360 horses care for one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.820
 maximum torque of 510 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.190
 Newton meters 5439 cubic centimeters 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 Large rooms stand well 1.5 tons 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.440
 empty weight no big 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 Challenge 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.560
 for the package not so for the driver 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.690
 the faux pas is a lot of engine for like that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.819
 little car it's like having one 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.590
 60 inch plasma TV in a ten 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.590
 hang square student dorm 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.740
 I just think the thing is a lot 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.630
 fish a piece for this car that 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.150
 smokes and smokes and stinks nolan totally 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.340
 At the same time we deliver to direct 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.400
 but then immediately the interventions in the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400
 electronics 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.830
 In everyday life, electronics is on 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.280
 guardian angel on the track test one 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.480
 Challenge 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.780
 the only thing a bit critical 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.770
 is when you come home the reflex 8 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.140
 go against and then comes the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.750
 electronics stabilize the car more often 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.069
 times principle ground steered and the and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.510
 if the electronics intervene you do 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.470
 then ever the the neighbors though 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.220
 It's a completely different direction 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.240
 want to go 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.670
 that's a bit where you are a bit 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.410
 have to take care 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.410
 if you really so extreme rides 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.390
 Here is the race diplomat in demand 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.420
 mediator between the power of the engine 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.340
 and the strict rules of electronics 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.890
 I think electronics could be synonymous 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.120
 from the unimog because they are very 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.080
 really intervene very hard 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080
 it lacks the sensitivity 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.010
 really could be a bit like that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.750
 it's a softer hand anyway 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.970
 boom in a hurry need electronics 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 we do not need electronics any more 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.020
 out he has so this transition could be 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.910
 so that children could be harmonious 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.110
 more supple of his now again attacks 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.110
 a tree and then there's free 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.000
 Precise driving is the order of the day 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.480
 electronics you can not quite 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.480
 copy 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.790
 just go to only forward presses 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.040
 the brush and it's cool too 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 you do not have to grab anything but purpose 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.580
 spit not just hingerotzt the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.440
 the price is just under 70,000 euros 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.290
 get into the eight-cylinder pleasure 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.700
 at the slk advisable and send the amg 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 performance package for 5355 euro next to 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.570
 styling features the time away behind the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.750
 18 inches because of ventilated 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.630
 High-performance brakes of caliber 360 mm 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.820
 thanks to the retractable in 22 seconds 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.290
 Variodach can be the sound orly too 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.120
 listen inside unfiltered 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.400
 the interior is mercedes typical 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.810
 functionally designed the performance 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.300
 Steering wheel and the alu shift paddles 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.610
 are as much a part of the package as the carbon 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.610
 elements and amg sports leather seats 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.660
 black beauty looks good though 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.670
 as fast as Naomi Campbell 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.590
 when in electronics at the c63 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.810
 for example, could turn off completely 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.700
 but these things would come in rows 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:01.290
 the forest retrospect the big brother c 63 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.920
 Amg manages with 1750 kilos and 457 hp 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.790
 a 111 73 that is ranked four in 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.070
 our best list 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.620
 the direct opponent z4 m from the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.320
 home bmw is 17ps weaker but 90th 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:22.870
 kilo leaner his resting time a 113 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:24.370
 68 and space currently eight, at least in 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.380
 me as a driver so 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.580
 But individual driving dynamics has the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.900
 no chance against chemistry 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.729
 zero chances 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.160
 Zero chance is not much but so 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.520
 quickly the slk 55 does not exist 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.520
 beaten 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.040
 in the curves, it depends on the 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.680
 force to dose so that the electronics 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.620
 patrick not intervening projection on 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.620
 the straight reaches the 192 2 km h 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.190
 good 8 km h faster than the bmw 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.539
 two more turns and a chicane can 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.990
 black beauty his opponent paroli 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.990
 Offer 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.210
 Patrick is right for the league 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.610
 the super sportsman has it as expected 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.130
 not enough with a strong 111 55 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.450
 he has his rivals z4 m roadster 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.630
 clearly beaten 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.080
 even big brother c63 will be in fifth place 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.460
 directed 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.460
 a surprising place four 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.560
 however, the track test is in progress 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.420
 also faster last year 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.130
 become 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.170
 to etch weather and edges 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.560
 the topmost bitumen movie literally 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.840
 wake up 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.860
 this increases the grip level and the 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.860
 lap times fall 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:25.449
 mercedes slk 55 amg i just say small 

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:27.339
 and mean z4 m roadster beaten c63 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.049
 beaten his bigger brother 

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.699
 surely he benefits from that 

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:32.649
 tracktest asphalt a bit faster 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.109
 has been over the winter but thanks 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.489
 seven-speed automatic has short wheelbase 

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:38.079
 he also drove the time and therefore 

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:42.159
 probably not shut down the esp completely 

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:45.599
 was not bad the power dwarf has 

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:45.599
 used his zero chance
