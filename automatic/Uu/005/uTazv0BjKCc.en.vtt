00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.730
 National tone 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.849
 This time thinking about achieving the goal 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.880
 I would like to talk about it 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:24.390
 In this way in a pretty world Kedomo I There are various of Tteyuu idea for goals 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.560
 Some people can achieve their goals and some people cannot. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.000
 Do you think 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:38.329
 In proportion to people who can not be achieved by 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 I think that the situation that 90. 80% people can not achieve is born 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:48.440
 In still and say whether this situation would why happened the first place to make way itself of its goals 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.899
 It is big that there is a problem 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.320
 So if you think about what you really need to do, you can achieve your goal 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:02.780
 I think that I want to your story because what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 Well, when you listen to this story, how can you achieve your goals? 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 Always is Rutteyuu things to have a compass in order to achieve that goal 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.070
 Basically, if there is a target place for marriage, there is no way to get there 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.460
 You need to know the way to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.550
 But many people do not have the compass 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 As we aim at the destination without knowing Japanese music at all, it is difficult to achieve 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.130
 It means that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.549
 vice versa 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 It will have a compass up to the target value in their own the Tteyuu people who can reach the target value 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 Even if there is a mountain in the way to the destination, it is in a state where the direction is also known 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.509
 It means that we can get over even if there are others 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.360
 Teaching the way to keep that compass 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:58.260
 There is only one way of thinking that I would like to talk about 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.480
 I think that you want to ask a little bit because it is only one 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.800
 That way of thinking 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:10.039
 It means that you must be in a suitable state 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.329
 It means that you must be in a suitable state 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.870
 I integral mean I'm a thing Tteyuu not only to the appropriate state 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:24.159
 Also it's a thing Tteyuu's 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 Worthy of human beings to say the state has reached the target value is still able to reach its target value 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:35.330
 It means that you will reach it when you become 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:40.690
 The three months in the case Tteyuu want to drop the 5 kg body weight in Well 3 months, for example, diet 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:45.160
 Aiming for a state where the weight of bookkeeping falls afterward 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.750
 It's such that say the result comes with a by becoming to the state 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.770
 It may be a bit difficult, but the person who achieves the goal is 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:59.260
 In a state appropriate to achieve that goal 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:03.700
 Well the Once carried out have their own I would do is I, for example, professional athletes, such that Rutte 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.290
 The state that is suitable for the purpose is the method other than becoming a professional person 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.569
 There is no 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.989
 so 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:18.750
 Always put in mind that Tteyuu do it but this, for example, appropriate state in the pros 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.930
 If you can do what you can do with what consciousness you can reach it or you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.859
 That 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.400
 What you come so it can be seen that I mean are you lack in comparison with the appropriate state 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.579
 is not it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.650
 Toka previous problem of eyes if you do not aim is Rutte things in the appropriate state to finger 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.730
 2 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.680
 Because or you use the physical strength or ended up using the energy or I spent a concentration 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.280
 I stumble there 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.660
 Even when I got stuck 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.880
 I can not see the target value- I'm still here 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.769
 I to Fu is Tteyuu until the man's Do I'm a woman of about this here or gone Well th 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.819
 It is to say that 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.500
 What does it mean that I am in a proper state that I want to be? 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.420
 Keep in mind what it means to make an effort worthwhile 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.230
 By aiming for the goal 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.290
 Tanigaa' Tari and mountain wants in that advances the way 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.910
 Well there are rivers and I think there are various problems, but 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.190
 Even if there is such a problem, it means that we can get over it 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:25.910
 It is I want you to remember to say not only to the appropriate state that if 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:29.639
 Even if I have not reached the goal yet , I happen to be my current goal 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:36.500
 It is not just a condition to reach 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:43.220
 Even if it was half of the goal achieved now, then another half 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.760
 Always accustomed to the state if we were the Tteyuu 2 seems effort and ingenuity in order to overcome the target 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.170
 It is to say that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:53.090
 Today may be a simple story and some difficult parts 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.090
 Thank you for watching until the end
