00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
kind of wishful thinking that Emma can

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
kind of wishful thinking that Emma can
hook<00:01:22.290> onto<00:01:22.909> Jeremy<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.420> they

hook onto Jeremy but that's what they

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
hook onto Jeremy but that's what they
need<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.899> that's<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.380> few<00:01:25.860> writers<00:01:26.100> have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
need to do that's what few writers have

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
need to do that's what few writers have
done<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> season<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.539> will<00:01:27.659> keep<00:01:27.869> them

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
