 and what kind of place of jairo palomino and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 I have had injuries eventualities in the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 football 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.460
 relationships is already done a lot that not 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.240

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.340
 again thank you goodbye 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.490
 it has freed me from that the last one is 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.880
 important 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.060
 that I frame a little for me was in the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.130
 2009 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 that out there we are playing very well 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.580
 we teach 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480
 to get ahead but 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 the lesson suddenly out there can not 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.520
 at the time 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.280
 the transition race 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.700
 Now I'm fine in your quiet study 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.670
 lessons waiting for what 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.530
 misfortune to at least play that what 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.310
 they deliver everything in every training in 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.440
 each party 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.390
 for lost 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.870
 I feel the waiting shirt 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.959
 after what 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.140
 let's show all that hello me to them 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.330
 and of all the companions and the body 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.489
 technician we can show you how well 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.709
 I plan Jairo because he was not in 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.709
 competition player conditions 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.560
 First of all, everything is ending 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.040
 close the topic of rabies 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.520
 you can usually 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.400
 the best way also out there 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.260
 he gave them several offers for his baby 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.420
 the racing is about to complete in 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.140
 bonding with them 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.980
 unfortunately 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.019
 it could not 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.030
 can be specified then we were 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.459
 analyzing offers outside and obviously 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.230
 hoping that the free country is here 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.470
 Colombia to reopen for for 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.150
 link us because not only from veracruz 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.150
 that we have another one for veracruz in mexico 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.570
 I do not think I know because I took the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.160
 decision to go to Argentina because 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.900
 I was very convinced that he was going 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.260
 that the negotiation was going to dissipate 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.010
 then over there discard the pre discard 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.140
 the option to go to Mexico 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.480
 unfortunately, it was not the case 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.160
 racing and decision or veracruz but 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.160
 God knows how to do his things 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.620
 I did not know we were going to come then 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 good 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.050
 which finally sends the message 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.469
 fans to commit to that 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.999
 institution 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.210
 First of all, always accompany us 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:54.039
 each party 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.680
 the team will be handed over to 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.960
 maximum the palomino ranch court in 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.449
 every 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.270
 let him play it because he is going to deliver 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.639
 to the maximum as it always does it is going to be 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.190
 respect the shirt and make respect 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.860
 those colors and hopefully I can 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.630
 have good empathy with them that they 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.639
 please join me and talk about 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.590

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.370
