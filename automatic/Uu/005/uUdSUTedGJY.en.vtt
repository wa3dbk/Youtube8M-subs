00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:03.920 
this is the video review for Real Steel

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.059 
this is the video review for Real Steel
Midas<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.660> like<00:00:06.660> noisy<00:00:07.080> boy<00:00:07.319> he's<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
Midas and like noisy boy he's one of the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.419 
Midas and like noisy boy he's one of the
more<00:00:08.250> stable<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.860> about<00:00:10.860> real<00:00:11.130> steel

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
more stable of the about real steel

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.539 
more stable of the about real steel
figures<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:13.080> mostly<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:13.769> he<00:00:14.309> has

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
figures and it's mostly because he has

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.220 
figures and it's mostly because he has
normal<00:00:15.450> legs<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.760> Zeus<00:00:17.760> does<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> he<00:00:19.199> has

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
normal legs like Zeus does and he has

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.140 
normal legs like Zeus does and he has
feet<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.890> go<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.369> around<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:21.480> Adam<00:00:21.869> does

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
feet that go all around like Adam does

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.519 
feet that go all around like Adam does
so<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.420> doesn't<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.869> feet<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.470> are

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
so one that doesn't have feet that are

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
so one that doesn't have feet that are
quite<00:00:26.010> wide<00:00:26.460> enough<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> support<00:00:27.240> him<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.599> all

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
quite wide enough to support him in all

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.349 
quite wide enough to support him in all
poses<00:00:28.260> he<00:00:28.859> does<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.640> pose<00:00:29.789> ability<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
poses he does have the pose ability that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500 
poses he does have the pose ability that
know<00:00:30.570> he's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> boy<00:00:30.929> doesn't<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.510> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
know he's a boy doesn't have so in that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.160 
know he's a boy doesn't have so in that
way<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:35.190> figure<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> noisy<00:00:36.570> boy<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
way this figure and noisy boy are the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 
way this figure and noisy boy are the
most<00:00:37.590> superior<00:00:38.090> mutt<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.079> guy<00:00:40.260> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
most superior mutt but this guy really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
most superior mutt but this guy really
fails<00:00:41.030> he's<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.270> paint<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.260> he

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
colors and he could really use some

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070 
colors and he could really use some
black<00:01:07.650> panel<00:01:08.130> line<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.090> break<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.930> off

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
black panel line just to break it off

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560

these<00:02:37.210> clicky<00:02:37.570> joints<00:02:37.960> are<00:02:38.080> really<00:02:38.710> tight<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
these clicky joints are really tight I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.850 
these clicky joints are really tight I
mean<00:02:39.820> it's<00:02:39.940> almost<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.240> he<00:02:40.600> has<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.320> slightly

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
mean it's almost like he has a slightly

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.200 
mean it's almost like he has a slightly
more<00:02:42.100> rubbery<00:02:43.860> plastic<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:45.400> him<00:02:45.580> because<00:02:45.850> this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
more rubbery plastic on him because this

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.980 
more rubbery plastic on him because this
is<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.200> starting<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.740> bend<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.250> stress

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.480 
is really starting to bend and stress
which<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> shame<00:02:50.500> because<00:02:50.560> despise

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
which is a shame because despise

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
blandness he's not bad he just could

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.500 
blandness he's not bad he just could
have<00:02:57.460> been<00:02:57.640> better<00:02:57.790> if<00:02:57.910> they<00:02:58.060> had<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> bit<00:02:58.360> more

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
have been better if they had a bit more

there are some bigger figures but I

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.590 
there are some bigger figures but I
don't<00:03:14.380> have<00:03:15.130> much<00:03:15.310> interest<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:16.120> those<00:03:16.240> at<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
don't have much interest in those at the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.479 
don't have much interest in those at the
time<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:17.020> might<00:03:17.260> take<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:17.950> up<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.220> see<00:03:18.340> how

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
time I might take one up and see how

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.000 
time I might take one up and see how
they<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.500> last<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.860> these

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
they are but this is the last of these

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.910 
they are but this is the last of these
and<00:03:21.340> really<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.820> line<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.870> doesn't<00:03:23.770> have

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
and really this line just doesn't have

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.400 
and really this line just doesn't have
the<00:03:23.950> quality<00:03:24.430> control<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.970> needs<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.660> really

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
the quality control it needs and really

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.449 
the quality control it needs and really
it<00:03:26.500> doesn't<00:03:26.560> need<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:27.010> great<00:03:27.220> quality

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
it doesn't need that great quality

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.360 
it doesn't need that great quality
control<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.180> needs<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.600> function<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:29.110> all

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
control it just needs to function at all

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.850 
control it just needs to function at all
which<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:32.020> at<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> draw<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.620> get

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
which it's like at a draw if you get

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.010 
which it's like at a draw if you get
joints<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.550> will<00:03:35.700> stress<00:03:36.700> apart<00:03:37.540> over<00:03:37.690> time

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
joints that will stress apart over time

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.360 
joints that will stress apart over time
or<00:03:38.290> not<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:41.709> shame<00:03:42.040> because<00:03:42.220> this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
or not and it's just shame because this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.460 
or not and it's just shame because this
could<00:03:42.550> have<00:03:42.670> been<00:03:42.760> such<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> neat<00:03:43.300> line<00:03:43.480> those

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
could have been such a neat line those

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.030 
could have been such a neat line those
are<00:03:44.590> my<00:03:44.680> thoughts<00:03:44.860> thank<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.550> for<00:03:45.700> watching
