00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.040
 is the new screen that has received 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.069
 today as we see it works correctly 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 but it happens that the button does not work 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.010
 home how are we going now 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.230
 on the way 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.230
 and any application 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.500
 and the home button 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.500
 do not press do nothing 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 I discovered that there are some contacts 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.879
 that you can measure the continuity of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 home button now I will show you and / or indicate 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.500
 where are the contacts so that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.390
 see that it does not close the contact when the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600
 screen when when you pressed the button 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.750
 home when we return here we are again with 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 the old screen disassembled here 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 and the new one still packed and unmounted 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.180
 we see that down here 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.059
 there are two contacts are network is total 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.290
 there is also the old budget 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.970
 just above the microphone gap 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.860
 those contacts serve for when 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 press the button there is continuity in those 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.530
 two contacts 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.000
 let's try like on the screen 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.000
 old the continuity and the new 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.770
 let's see the new screen first 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.820
 pulse 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.820
 press 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.470
 swift let's see with the contact 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.310
 It was very good from the old screen 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.610
 pulse 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.360
 we see in the metro there is 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.360
 continuity be gentle pulse 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.940
 and so we see that the screen as you have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.480
