00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.890 

it<00:01:52.240> sounds<00:01:52.720> quite<00:01:52.990> good<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.909> really<00:01:55.360> does<00:01:55.630> run

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
it sounds quite good it really does run

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.410 
it sounds quite good it really does run
right<00:01:56.140> along<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.250> despite<00:02:00.790> only<00:02:01.000> having<00:02:01.090> one

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
right along and despite only having one

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.899 
right along and despite only having one
engine<00:02:01.840> choice<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.400> see<00:02:03.580> why<00:02:03.700> they<00:02:03.820> don't

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
engine choice you can see why they don't

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.300 
engine choice you can see why they don't
put<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.240> v8<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.720> us<00:02:04.930> anymore<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.860> at<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
put the v8 in us anymore you know at the

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.930 
put the v8 in us anymore you know at the
VA<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:07.030> was<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.869> old<00:02:07.930> GS<00:02:08.380> wasn't<00:02:08.979> faster

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
VA that was in the old GS wasn't faster

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.400 
VA that was in the old GS wasn't faster
than<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.270> really<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.690> anyway<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.230> just

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
than this really in anyway and it just

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.620 
than this really in anyway and it just
got<00:02:11.530> worse<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.010> economy<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.330> compare

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
got worse and economy when you compare

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.470 
got worse and economy when you compare
it<00:02:13.660> across<00:02:13.810> its<00:02:14.470> class<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.910> other<00:02:16.120> cars

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
it across its class to the other cars

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
it across its class to the other cars
and<00:02:16.989> really<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.380> think<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.800> mid-level<00:02:18.280> car

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
and really I think the mid-level car

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.500 
and really I think the mid-level car
sure<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> 335<00:02:19.480> s<00:02:19.840> faster<00:02:20.260> than<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.700> m37

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
sure a 335 s faster than this and in m37

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
sure a 335 s faster than this and in m37
might<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.290> although<00:02:23.739> I'll<00:02:23.890> tell<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.160> when<00:02:24.280> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
might be although I'll tell you when you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.750 
might be although I'll tell you when you
drive<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.570> m37<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.470> doesn't<00:02:26.800> feel<00:02:27.340> quite<00:02:27.640> as

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
drive the m37 it doesn't feel quite as

manual mode one of those disappointments

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.580 
manual mode one of those disappointments
is<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.420> fact<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:08.110> still<00:03:08.410> has<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
is the fact that this still has a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.069 
is the fact that this still has a
six-speed<00:03:09.190> transmission<00:03:09.910> which<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.540> realize

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
six-speed transmission which I realize

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.810 
six-speed transmission which I realize
just<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.470> few<00:03:11.650> years<00:03:11.980> ago<00:03:12.160> would<00:03:12.459> have<00:03:12.579> sounded

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
just a few years ago would have sounded

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.880 
just a few years ago would have sounded
weird<00:03:13.570> but<00:03:14.350> today<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:16.360> do<00:03:16.630> sort<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.350> expect

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
weird but today you do sort of expect

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.030 
weird but today you do sort of expect
again<00:03:18.540> more<00:03:19.540> ratios<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.620> car<00:03:20.860> could

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
again more ratios and this car could

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.100 
again more ratios and this car could
definitely<00:03:21.250> use<00:03:21.730> them<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.120> know<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.510> all

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
definitely use them you know that all

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.250 
definitely use them you know that all
8-speed<00:03:23.739> transmission<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.579> they<00:03:24.730> put<00:03:25.030> in

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
8-speed transmission that they put in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.430 
8-speed transmission that they put in
for<00:03:26.260> example<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.920> ISF<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:28.329> think<00:03:29.019> would<00:03:29.200> do<00:03:29.410> a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
for example the ISF I think would do a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.530 
for example the ISF I think would do a
bit<00:03:29.890> more<00:03:30.190> for<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.670> engine<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.209> make<00:03:31.390> it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
bit more for this engine and make it

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.229 
bit more for this engine and make it
even<00:03:31.840> sporty<00:03:32.709> or<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:32.950> characteristic<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
even sporty or and characteristic the

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.020 
even sporty or and characteristic the
good<00:03:34.450> news<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.380> year

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
good news is for this year

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.220 
good news is for this year
they<00:03:36.780> did<00:03:37.190> go<00:03:38.190> through<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.060> reprogram<00:03:39.959> this

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
they did go through and reprogram this

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.800 
they did go through and reprogram this
six-speed<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.069> make<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.430> quicker<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:42.270> bit

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
six-speed to make it quicker a bit

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.170 
six-speed to make it quicker a bit
smarter<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.650> better<00:03:43.980> at<00:03:44.250> rev-matching<00:03:44.819> on

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
smarter and better at rev-matching on

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.350 
smarter and better at rev-matching on
down<00:03:45.420> shifts<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:49.670> engine<00:03:50.670> works<00:03:50.940> quite<00:03:51.330> well

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
down shifts the engine works quite well

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.630 
down shifts the engine works quite well
sure<00:03:52.230> could<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.770> couple<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.160> horsepower

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
sure could have a couple more horsepower

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.729 
sure could have a couple more horsepower
but<00:03:53.880> really<00:03:54.239> you're<00:03:54.480> not<00:03:54.630> left<00:03:54.900> wanting<00:03:55.530> for

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
but really you're not left wanting for

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.470 
but really you're not left wanting for
much<00:03:55.950> there<00:03:56.220> sounds<00:03:56.880> good

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
much there sounds good

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.990 
much there sounds good
transmission<00:03:58.470> works<00:03:58.709> well<00:03:59.010> might<00:03:59.790> need<00:03:59.970> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
transmission works well might need a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.870 
transmission works well might need a
couple<00:04:00.090> more<00:04:00.420> ratios<00:04:00.930> how<00:04:01.830> about<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.370> rest<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
couple more ratios how about the rest of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.000 
couple more ratios how about the rest of
the<00:04:03.030> dynamics<00:04:03.660> well<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:06.319> steering<00:04:07.319> works

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the dynamics well the steering works

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.000 
the dynamics well the steering works
well<00:04:08.970> technically<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.930> does<00:04:10.260> pretty<00:04:10.890> much

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
well technically it does pretty much

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.340 
well technically it does pretty much
what<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.640> wanted<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.269> know<00:04:12.390> as<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:13.080> move

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
what you wanted to you know as you move

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.280 
what you wanted to you know as you move
it<00:04:13.590> around<00:04:14.390> what<00:04:15.390> you're<00:04:15.600> conveying<00:04:15.959> through

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
it around what you're conveying through

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.380 
it around what you're conveying through
the<00:04:16.410> wheel<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:17.370> what's<00:04:17.730> gonna<00:04:17.880> happen<00:04:18.269> with

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
the wheel is what's gonna happen with

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.050 
the wheel is what's gonna happen with
the<00:04:18.510> car<00:04:18.829> but<00:04:19.829> how<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.850> feels<00:04:21.419> doing<00:04:21.930> that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the car but how it feels doing that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.120 
the car but how it feels doing that
easing<00:04:24.060> crane<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.840> know<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.590> steering

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
easing crane you know the the steering

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.880 
easing crane you know the the steering
the<00:04:26.760> common<00:04:27.300> term<00:04:27.720> for<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.260> numb<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.830> I

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
the common term for it is numb and I

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.020 
the common term for it is numb and I
think<00:04:29.130> numb<00:04:29.400> might<00:04:29.640> be<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:30.830> little<00:04:31.830> unfair<00:04:32.280> you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
think numb might be a little unfair you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.120 
think numb might be a little unfair you
do<00:04:33.240> know<00:04:33.630> what's<00:04:33.900> going<00:04:34.169> on<00:04:34.350> because<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
do know what's going on because the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.810 
do know what's going on because the
actual<00:04:35.430> suspension<00:04:36.240> tuning<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:37.380> very<00:04:38.280> good<00:04:38.580> so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
actual suspension tuning is very good so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.140 
actual suspension tuning is very good so
from<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.690> ride<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.740> handling<00:04:41.250> perspective

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
from a ride and handling perspective

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.719 
from a ride and handling perspective
again<00:04:42.900> Lexus<00:04:43.380> has<00:04:43.530> really<00:04:43.950> done<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.400> lot<00:04:44.520> of

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
again Lexus has really done a lot of

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.300 
again Lexus has really done a lot of
work<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.419> new<00:04:45.810> suspension<00:04:46.410> geometry<00:04:46.740> that's

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
work this new suspension geometry that's

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.540 
work this new suspension geometry that's
in<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.640> car<00:04:48.470> makes<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.040> when<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.280> go

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
in this car makes it so that when you go

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.620 
in this car makes it so that when you go
over<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.940> normal<00:04:51.780> mode<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.330> really

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
over to normal mode you get a really

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.770 
over to normal mode you get a really
quite<00:04:55.289> refined<00:04:55.740> ride<00:04:56.150> with<00:04:57.150> pouted

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
completely wiping away what's happening

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.600 
completely wiping away what's happening
with<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.120> road<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:01.080> when<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.950> flip<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.280> back

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
doesn't change the suspension tuning so

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.390 
doesn't change the suspension tuning so

swear you know it becomes a fun thing to

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.700 
swear you know it becomes a fun thing to
go<00:05:19.950> toss

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
go toss

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.779 
go toss
on<00:05:21.039> backroads<00:05:21.600> which<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:23.560> old<00:05:23.680> GIS<00:05:24.190> might

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
on backroads which the old GIS might

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.810 
on backroads which the old GIS might
have<00:05:24.970> seemed<00:05:25.300> grunty<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.740> really<00:05:27.550> couldn't

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
have seemed grunty but really couldn't

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.279 
have seemed grunty but really couldn't
play<00:05:28.000> with<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:28.630> again<00:05:28.690> when<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.139> go

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
play with this and again when you go

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.320 
play with this and again when you go
look<00:05:29.530> at<00:05:29.650> this<00:05:29.889> car<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.580> it's<00:05:30.789> dynamics

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
look at this car and it's dynamics

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.439 
look at this car and it's dynamics
across<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.840> line<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.080> think<00:05:32.880> BMW<00:05:33.880> still<00:05:34.210> needs

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
across the line I think BMW still needs

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.279 
across the line I think BMW still needs
in<00:05:34.660> those<00:05:34.810> aspects<00:05:35.350> in<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.830> XF<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.669> Waze<00:05:36.970> is

in those aspects in the XF and Waze is

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.960 
in those aspects in the XF and Waze is
sporty<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.440> dynamic<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:39.039> drive<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.940> e

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970

depending on which model you get can

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
adjusted the stability system so it has

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.100 
adjusted the stability system so it has
a<00:06:23.509> bit<00:06:23.780> more<00:06:23.810> play<00:06:24.229> in<00:06:24.259> it<00:06:24.500> but<00:06:25.419> I've<00:06:26.419> yet<00:06:27.050> to

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
a bit more play in it but I've yet to

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.110 
a bit more play in it but I've yet to

been able to activate it and whatever

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.290 
been able to activate it and whatever
you<00:06:29.419> really<00:06:29.840> start<00:06:30.199> to<00:06:30.289> get<00:06:30.380> into<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.860> the

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
you really start to get into it the

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.580 
you really start to get into it the
stability<00:06:32.300> control<00:06:32.690> system<00:06:33.139> even<00:06:33.380> though<00:06:33.470> it

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
stability control system even though it

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.010 
stability control system even though it
says<00:06:33.740> you<00:06:33.919> can<00:06:34.069> turn<00:06:34.280> off<00:06:34.550> traction<00:06:35.030> it

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
says you can turn off traction it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.420 
says you can turn off traction it
doesn't<00:06:36.320> say<00:06:36.470> you<00:06:36.530> can<00:06:36.770> fully<00:06:37.009> turn<00:06:37.250> off

doesn't say you can fully turn off
stability<00:06:38.090> it's<00:06:38.300> definitely<00:06:38.660> not<00:06:38.780> defeatable

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
stability it's definitely not defeatable

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.520 
stability it's definitely not defeatable
and<00:06:40.090> very<00:06:41.090> rarely<00:06:41.539> I<00:06:41.780> think<00:06:42.139> would<00:06:42.289> have<00:06:42.380> come

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
and very rarely I think would have come

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.230 
and very rarely I think would have come
into<00:06:42.710> play<00:06:42.949> with<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.520> rear-wheel<00:06:43.789> drive<00:06:43.880> only

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
into play with the rear-wheel drive only

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.939 
into play with the rear-wheel drive only
one<00:06:44.630> I<00:06:44.900> think<00:06:44.990> that<00:06:45.199> might<00:06:45.440> be<00:06:45.470> a<00:06:45.590> bit<00:06:45.800> of<00:06:45.889> a

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
one I think that might be a bit of a

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.770 
one I think that might be a bit of a
different<00:06:46.280> story<00:06:46.460> but<00:06:47.240> we<00:06:47.389> haven't<00:06:47.599> had<00:06:47.690> a

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
different story but we haven't had a

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.719 
different story but we haven't had a
chance<00:06:47.840> to<00:06:48.289> drive<00:06:48.560> one<00:06:48.949> of<00:06:49.099> those<00:06:49.280> yet<00:06:49.789> so
