00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.130
 you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.180
 today i'm not going to tell anything about her nice time checking on your horse already 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.949
 then does not have that problem 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.529
 it may be that you do check with a few set for example 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.600
 But it can also happen that you noticed that the pain eased for the 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.869
 responded 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.100
 if you really could attend and know neighborhoods 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.010
 a few back we stay then of course it is always going wrong 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.649
 consult experts 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.630
 hence these tests themselves already have some idea 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.050
 to what extent your horse is with the voter 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.600
 the test that is done more often to check for pain a few times 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.180
 is the next one I'll demonstrate with 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.500
 continue with the nails 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.490
 went over the back of a horse 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.840
 it often looks tub still has a frightening breakdown actually 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.680
 this Friday some information 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.990
 namely we want to test three different things we want to test on it 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.700
 horse is sensitive on the skin 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.650
 or that is sensitive on the muscles or that is sensitive on the vertebrae or the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.520
 ligaments and in particular the superficial part deeper 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 located structures cannot be tested 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740
 this test gives some information on Friday 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.500
 what this test actually only brings 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.939
 spare horse is sensitive on the skin but the many say nothing at all 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.220
 that it is also sensitive to the muscles 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 I now show you the three different tests, the tests for the skin 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 sensitivity to muscle sensitivity and to the sensitivity of the vertebrae 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.670
 I start with the skin 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 And that is actually the test that just made it a different competition friendlier 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.100
 because I do it a little slower 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.060
 I use my nails just a little and I put one among them 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.950
 guide next to the spine 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.460
 and then a quiet backwards 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 and then I look at the horse giving a response 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.330
 well he indicates reaction but this is pure reaction that gives to the skin 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.549
 they sag somewhat sensitive on the skin, but that should also be because 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.410
 the horse reacts if there is a vision on his skin so this is one for me 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.330
 absolutely no different 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.320
 the following test in goal is actually much more relevant 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.660
 the point is then on the horse they are sensitive on the muscles 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.120
 what i do then is to put my fingers still on the skin and on the muscle and 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.120
 then press enter the depth 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.489
 and i do that at different places i move my hand with ice it 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.340
 move 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.809
 I hardly touch, or hardly touch, for a few times 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.379
 he is also often from front to back 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.379
 and I see if it gives immune response to the muscle 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.079
 but this is not a defense response 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.310
 I'm going to do the best for a while now, as he actually doesn't hear but for you 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.639
 to show what happens if a horse does respond 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.009
 I am now doing the same test with my nails 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.459
 thereby pull in the muscle 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.049
 look and then you see that doing 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.319
 the back of a horse is pulled slightly downwards that the horse 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.859
 tightens his back muscles and that is a new window response and that is possible 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.859
 indicate that the horse is sensitive to its players 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.089
 you do that both on the left and right of the spine 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.259
 the third prize between pestis tests whether the horse is sensitive or its spinal 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:03.239
 protrusions that are the protrusions of the vertebrae and run over them 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.089
 also a ligament is that ice cream that way 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.930
 I can start to suspend myself 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.869
 And then again, your hand stops 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:13.569
 in a certain place on the bone 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.549
 and then busy 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 and then move your hand and then give back 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.289
 and that's how you do it 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.449
 all day long 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.439
 and hereby the horse is allowed 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.399
 don't respond 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.729
 in the sense that he is pushing his back down 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.139
 sixth place against a finger impression that the government is always like that 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.659
 and I don't want the purple to push back down 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.339
 here we see that the horse has indeed not responded 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.989
 I no longer show very briefly what it would look like if the horse did 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.339
 give a response for that I put the ice on the lake if you actually do not hear 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.239
 but then you can see what happens 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.519
 the moment that horse is painful 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.299
 I am now busy with ten for Koeman 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.509
 just a little bit with my days to provoke your response 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.120
 He can get with this reaction that the horse sometime back 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.609
 what presses down in the viewer with him is even difficult for each other 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.179
 so it is pretty sensible that the reach is in eleven 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.499
 those are actually the 3 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.229
 yes voice you can do 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.340
 if the horse reacts to the skin that is not such a problem 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.729
 give the reaction to the bike 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.659
 he usually wants to ask that it is sensitive in that area too 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.979
 communicate you also give reaction in the workplace who have planned 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.249
 then that's for sure 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.619
 As a sign that you have to take it seriously let the viewer through an expert 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.599
 out 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.240
 this means 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.300
 anp
