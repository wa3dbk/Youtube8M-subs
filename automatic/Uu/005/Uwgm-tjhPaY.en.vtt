00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello who make us I hope that 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.980
 you are well I find today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.109
 to share with you two methods 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.220
 which are alternatives to the mrap and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.260
 so for that they do not offer the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.700
 engrave his methods that allows me or who 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.549
 allows whoever wears hair 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.199
 smooth high school opera high school seezanne h and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.039
 the evening without having to retouch 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.210
 the next morning 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 and so it's a method that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 I particularly like it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.710
 succeed rather well and never 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 by the way makes a video where I you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 shows how I go to europe is to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 to say really very long but I 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 did not change at the method level 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.929
 so you enjoyed this video 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.270
 you have been very very very numerous in 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.800
 to have said that it is good but that it is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.820
 difficult to do and I agree 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 say that when we do not have the hang of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.090
 hand and just what is a little galley and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 so I know I could find 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.809
 two alternatives to the arm so you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.579
 also you can keep your hair 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 smooth his know-how of a sure hit the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.860
 morning and especially in a very simple and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.260
 for that of course it will take a scarf 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.789
 shares to bun a brush and then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.070
 that's all and so at the whim 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 with the first method of course 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 that he can not forget to brush himself 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.670
 hair starting with the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.930
 tips 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.040
 so yes I already moisturize the hair 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.330
 in the valiant but do any 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.070
 way I had you did not make a video 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
 where I show you when I put a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 scraped hair in the evening before bedtime 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.750
 with smooth hair and so you 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 will see the information point that goes 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.799
 drag to the site you are then the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 first method is called the arm cros 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 and it's just a wrap of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 cross way 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.310
 so I show you right now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 how do we do so then you it is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.380
 not funny hair in two parts a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.799
 another rather equal party bruce is good 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.159
 to keep them smooth and flat 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.390
 then you take the first half 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.390
 to flatten your hair here 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.120
 and then you 're rapper but like 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.840
 the white ones and there you flatten your hair 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.880
 you catch on that side and you 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.780
 go up like that when you catch 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.020
 a chignon savings and you're going 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 come secure but really on the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.790
 tip on the ends of beautiful hair 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.080
 so here you keep it well I want to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 flat and you apache and then we can 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.300
 not go to the other side 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 so here I take my other part of 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 hair I'm doing a drag like that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.709
 and then I come back from wind I believe 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.170
 another machine will have I think 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.040
 so here is the hair attached if 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 you have very short hair 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.660
 do not hesitate to add as many 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.070
 starting to chignon as necessary for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.870
 really maintain the hair according to 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190
 you lift there I take in to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.470
 scarves so it's really a scarf 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.600
 very simple nothing exceptional it is 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 in satin and I come series behind 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.180
 like that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.650
 locatel i'm ready to sleep so 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.819
 according to Reuters and that's it 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.340
 simply the rap crozes 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.939
 if you are afraid that your hair will mark 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.840
 you can not slip the pins 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:08.159
 since the headscarf so here I am out 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.310
 a first pin g out the 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.310
 second 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.690
 here and so if the headscarf and berlin has 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.100
 finally it should not move at night 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.420
 if you are scared like under the bush era 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.030
 do not hesitate to take it down really 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 down on the forehead and ears so the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.540
 evening it happens that I do not feel 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.710
 really like I had a mask on 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.210
 eyes at least I'm sure my 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.820
 scarf will not be seen there I 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.530
 really go down on the trunk 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.700
 and not on the ears, though 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 do not over tighten because otherwise it's the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.160
 woman was finally animated in the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.480
 real are there you go 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.490
 then for the second method there 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.580
 yet you need to pine 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.780
 bun of your scarf is always 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
 to have first 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.170
 behind the debauchery of this method 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.920
 it's really my favorite method when 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.590
 I'm lazy to make me serious so 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.700
 I'm doing this method simply 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.790
 then to be methods you have to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.610
 gather your hair back there 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.740
 must the bush and always the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:14.610
 dvd of a sure then you want to ride 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.109
 in a ponytail of course not see the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.959
 hair long enough to do that 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.830
 I agree 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.410
 then I'm going to make a bun 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.490
 really very loose so I turn a 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.090
 little my hair to keep them 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.260
 together and I turn them as if 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.260
 I was going to make a bun but without 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.570
 squeeze hard and there is no need for 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.320
 putties in general I take some 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.590
 bun pins 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.380
 and I come to think one and then one 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.750
 second to really be sure that that 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.000
 do not move during the night so there I 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.040
 feel a little sumo but it's the state 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.780
 who really does me if you are afraid that 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.700
 your roots great flat again at night 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.630
 you go you can take a small 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.070
 little cream to smooth the contour of 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.510
 your hair so pretty the edge 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.910
 besides, I have character that I apply 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.490
 his camp at night so in principle them I 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.890
 plate my hair then I brush and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.140
 there as just now I like to be in 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.940
 scarf and their revenge I 'm fine at 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.040
 what my hair tomorrow will be a veneer 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.440
 and logically the next morning my 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.850
 hair are the same forever 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.350
 stiff that the day before they still 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.720
 small years of a high station 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.650
 bun that I did but it's something 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.800
 something that suits me because I like 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.670
 not see the hair ready to awesome background 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.880
 which is a little bit of a movements 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.290
 few of you and so here 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.450
 and so that's the video is over 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.620
