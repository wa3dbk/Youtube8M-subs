face frameless cabinet is the Machine
the<00:00:14.490> cabinet<00:00:14.880> parts<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the cabinet parts and we're going to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.550 
the cabinet parts and we're going to
start<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.580> panel<00:00:18.210> saw<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:18.930> which

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
start on this panel saw right here which

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740 
start on this panel saw right here which
is<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.950> to<00:00:20.100> allow<00:00:20.369> us<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.610> cut<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> parts<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
is going to allow us to cut the parts to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.010 
is going to allow us to cut the parts to
a<00:00:21.780> nominal<00:00:22.410> size<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.240> when<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.270> say<00:00:24.510> nominal

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
a nominal size and when I say nominal

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.779 
a nominal size and when I say nominal
size<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:25.980> they're<00:00:26.190> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.520> little

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
size I mean they're going to be a little

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
size I mean they're going to be a little
larger<00:00:27.029> than<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.289> need<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
larger than what they actually need to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.640 
larger than what they actually need to
be<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.699> will<00:00:29.910> size<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.600> down<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
be we will size them down over on the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.400 
be we will size them down over on the
table<00:00:31.859> saw<00:00:32.250> after<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:33.570> cut<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.230> so

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
table saw after I get them cut here so

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
table saw after I get them cut here so
let<00:00:35.310> me<00:00:35.399> tell<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.570> about

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
varieties of vertical panel saws they

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.840 
varieties of vertical panel saws they
range<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.270> oh<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.260> one's<00:00:46.469> probably<00:00:46.850> $1,500

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
range from oh this one's probably $1,500

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.049 
range from oh this one's probably $1,500
up<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.360> around<00:00:48.770> $80,000<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
up to around $80,000 this is on the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
up to around $80,000 this is on the
lower<00:00:51.270> end<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> price<00:00:52.320> range<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.980> would

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lower end of the price range this would

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
lower end of the price range this would
be<00:00:53.250> perfect<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> small<00:00:54.270> cabinet<00:00:54.719> shop

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
be perfect for the small cabinet shop

be perfect for the small cabinet shop
the<00:00:55.260> $80,000<00:00:56.010> models<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.610> digitally

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the $80,000 models are digitally

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.279 
the $80,000 models are digitally
controlled<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.410> precise<00:01:00.289> again

controlled and very precise again

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
controlled and very precise again
remember<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:01.950> using<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
remember we're just using this to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
remember we're just using this to
nominally<00:01:03.450> cut<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:03.870> pieces<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.350> material<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
nominally cut our pieces of material so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.149 
nominally cut our pieces of material so
it<00:01:05.519> doesn't<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> precise<00:01:07.159> let

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it doesn't have to be that precise let

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
it doesn't have to be that precise let
me<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.299> specifics<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
me show you some of the specifics of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
me show you some of the specifics of
this<00:01:10.260> piece<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> equipment<00:01:11.420> our<00:01:12.420> material<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this piece of equipment our material is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.730 
this piece of equipment our material is
going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> sit<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> bed<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.500> bed<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to sit on a bed and the bed is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to sit on a bed and the bed is
made<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.520> rollers<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.479> roll<00:01:18.900> along<00:01:19.280> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
made up of rollers that roll along so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
made up of rollers that roll along so
it's<00:01:20.460> very<00:01:20.640> easy<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.390> move<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.960> material

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's very easy to move your material

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's very easy to move your material
once<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> bed<00:01:23.549> back<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> forth

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.840 

we<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> portable<00:01:30.930> saw<00:01:31.620> up<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we have a portable saw up here that is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
we have a portable saw up here that is
mounted<00:01:33.300> on<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:33.900> bars<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.920> are

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
mounted on two bars that are

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.540 
mounted on two bars that are
perpendicular<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.840> bed<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.400> get

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
perpendicular to the bed so that we get

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.250 
perpendicular to the bed so that we get
a<00:01:38.610> nice<00:01:38.910> 90<00:01:39.420> degree<00:01:39.900> cut<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
a nice 90 degree cut just have a little

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.170 
a nice 90 degree cut just have a little
knob<00:01:43.440> here<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:44.010> loosens<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.970> allows

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
knob here that loosens this and allows

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.290 
knob here that loosens this and allows
me<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.480> move<00:01:45.690> it<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.550> run

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
me to move it up and down and I can run

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.490 
me to move it up and down and I can run
this<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.370> cut<00:01:50.550> my<00:01:50.700> materials

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.370 

the<00:01:55.500> salt<00:01:55.800> can<00:01:55.979> also<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.670> turned<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the salt can also be turned so that the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.830 
the salt can also be turned so that the
blade<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.710> running<00:01:59.280> horizontally<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
blade is running horizontally the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440 
blade is running horizontally the
problem<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.850> can't<00:02:03.150> move

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
problem there is is that you can't move

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.719 
problem there is is that you can't move
it<00:02:03.630> side<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.050> side

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it side to side

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.249 
it side to side
you<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> move<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.330> material<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you have to move the material through it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
you have to move the material through it
so<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.470> don't<00:02:07.740> use<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.100> very<00:02:08.130> often<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so we don't use it very often for that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.340 
so we don't use it very often for that
operation<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:12.150> last<00:02:12.390> part<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.900> need<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> talk

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
operation the last part we need to talk

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.040 
operation the last part we need to talk
about<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.400> scale<00:02:15.000> Center<00:02:15.600> measuring

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
about is the scale Center measuring

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.840 
about is the scale Center measuring
scale<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.740> we<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> know<00:02:17.490> where<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
scale because we have to know where to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.790 
scale because we have to know where to
put<00:02:18.120> our<00:02:18.180> piece<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.600> material<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.500> saw<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
put our piece of material on the saw to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.370 
put our piece of material on the saw to
make<00:02:20.100> our<00:02:20.280> cuts<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.350> a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
make our cuts as you can see we have a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.949 
make our cuts as you can see we have a
scale<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.160> inches<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> scale

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
scale here in inches and we have a scale

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.870 
scale here in inches and we have a scale
here<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.320> millimeters<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.670> this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
here in millimeters and on this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.060 
here in millimeters and on this
particular<00:02:27.390> project<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.080> European<00:02:28.560> cabinet

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
particular project the European cabinet

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.350 
particular project the European cabinet
we're<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.459> working<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.910> millimeter

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
we're going to be working in millimeter

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.180 
we're going to be working in millimeter
so<00:02:30.600> we'll<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.900> working<00:02:31.260> off<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.770> bottom

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so we'll be working off of this bottom

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.540 
so we'll be working off of this bottom
scale<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.840> stop<00:02:34.230> right<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.459> we

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
scale we have a stop right here that we

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030 
scale we have a stop right here that we
can<00:02:35.730> move<00:02:35.910> along<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.810> put<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
can move along here and put it on the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.840 
can move along here and put it on the
exact<00:02:39.410> measurement<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.980> want<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> cut<00:02:41.610> on

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
exact measurement that we want to cut on

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.650 
exact measurement that we want to cut on
the<00:02:41.970> saw<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.200> once<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.980> stop<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.459> set<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
the saw so once the stop is set we just

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.390 
the saw so once the stop is set we just
move<00:02:46.140> our<00:02:46.320> material<00:02:46.910> over<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.180> stop

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.670 

and<00:02:52.409> make<00:02:53.409> our<00:02:53.440> cut<00:02:55.349> since<00:02:56.349> we're<00:02:56.530> building

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
and make our cut since we're building

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.740 
and make our cut since we're building
this<00:02:57.010> cabinet<00:02:57.430> out<00:02:57.549> of<00:02:57.670> melamine<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.629> a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
this cabinet out of melamine and it's a

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.229 
this cabinet out of melamine and it's a
solid<00:02:59.019> material<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.580> don't<00:03:00.760> really<00:03:00.909> need<00:03:01.120> to

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
solid material we don't really need to

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.660 
solid material we don't really need to
worry<00:03:01.450> about<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.930> direction<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.530> grain<00:03:02.890> but

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
worry about the direction of grain but

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.170 
worry about the direction of grain but
if<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.810> was<00:03:05.019> wood<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:06.129> had<00:03:06.340> grain<00:03:06.730> which

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
if this was wood and we had grain which

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.440 
if this was wood and we had grain which
is<00:03:07.209> usually<00:03:07.750> going<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> long<00:03:08.769> direction

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
is usually going in the long direction

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.240 
is usually going in the long direction
we<00:03:10.450> wouldn't<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.840> able<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.170> lay<00:03:11.349> our<00:03:11.530> sides<00:03:11.890> out

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
we wouldn't be able to lay our sides out

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.690 
we wouldn't be able to lay our sides out
like<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.769> because<00:03:14.769> then<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.159> grain<00:03:15.430> would

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
like this because then the grain would

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.910 
like this because then the grain would
be<00:03:15.849> going<00:03:16.209> horizontally<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.140> sides<00:03:17.530> so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
be going horizontally on the sides so

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.160 
be going horizontally on the sides so
we'd<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.760> rethink<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.810> because

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
we'd have to rethink this but because

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.949 
we'd have to rethink this but because
we're<00:03:20.349> using<00:03:20.379> melamine<00:03:21.099> we're<00:03:21.640> able<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.150> lay

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
we're using melamine we're able to lay

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.349 
we're using melamine we're able to lay
it<00:03:23.079> out<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.829> best<00:03:24.069> way<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.310> optimize<00:03:25.030> our

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
it out in the best way to optimize our

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.050 
it out in the best way to optimize our
material<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.140> what<00:03:27.099> I've<00:03:27.220> done<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.879> I've

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
material and what I've done here is I've

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.110 
material and what I've done here is I've
taken<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.569> 4x8<00:03:29.440> sheet<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.069> melamine<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.940> we

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
taken a 4x8 sheet of melamine like we

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.809 
taken a 4x8 sheet of melamine like we
have<00:03:31.299> here<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.980> blown<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.129> up<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> piece<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
have here and blown it up on a piece of

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.210 
have here and blown it up on a piece of
paper<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:35.109> how<00:03:35.890> I'm<00:03:36.069> going

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
paper so that you can see how I'm going

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.970 
paper so that you can see how I'm going
to<00:03:36.280> cut<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.940> cabinet<00:03:37.390> parts<00:03:37.720> out<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.859> is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
to cut the cabinet parts out and this is

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.979 
to cut the cabinet parts out and this is
a<00:03:39.040> very<00:03:39.250> simple<00:03:39.640> cabinet<00:03:40.329> we<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:40.569> have<00:03:40.720> two

a very simple cabinet we just have two

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.640 
a very simple cabinet we just have two
sides<00:03:41.290> we<00:03:42.129> have<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.280> bottom<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.940> top<00:03:43.629> and<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.290> shelf

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.940 
sides we have a bottom a top and a shelf
and<00:03:44.940> what<00:03:45.940> I'm<00:03:46.060> trying<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.420> do<00:03:46.659> is<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.200> cut<00:03:47.709> this

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
and what I'm trying to do is is cut this

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.880 
and what I'm trying to do is is cut this
in<00:03:48.220> such<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> way<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:50.349> a<00:03:50.379> minimum

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
in such a way that I have a minimum

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.589 
in such a way that I have a minimum
amount<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.340> waste<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.090> can<00:03:52.239> see<00:03:52.420> these

help<00:03:58.419> illustrate<00:03:58.959> how<00:03:59.680> we're<00:03:59.950> going<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.400> cut

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
help illustrate how we're going to cut

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.420 
help illustrate how we're going to cut
our<00:04:01.150> cabinet<00:04:01.569> parts<00:04:01.840> out<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.049> want<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.470> draw<00:04:02.859> the

it chips very easily and also I might

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.220 
it chips very easily and also I might
add<00:06:17.650> that<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:18.580> can<00:06:18.850> cut<00:06:19.210> you<00:06:19.420> very<00:06:19.660> easily<00:06:19.900> on
