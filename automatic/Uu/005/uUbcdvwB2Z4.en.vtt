today I'm going to show you a simple
exercise<00:00:03.959> for<00:00:05.210> developing<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:07.020> muscle

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
exercise for developing the muscle

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.850 
exercise for developing the muscle
control<00:00:08.069> needed<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> good<00:00:09.960> finger<00:00:10.679> vibrato

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
control needed for a good finger vibrato

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.570 
control needed for a good finger vibrato
up<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.300> way<00:00:12.719> high<00:00:12.960> positions<00:00:13.559> where<00:00:14.429> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
up in the way high positions where you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
up in the way high positions where you
really<00:00:15.000> can't<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.509> an<00:00:15.599> arm<00:00:15.750> vibrato<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
really can't have an arm vibrato and you

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.210 
really can't have an arm vibrato and you
really<00:00:17.039> can't<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.880> wrist<00:00:18.510> vibrato<00:00:19.220> you're

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
really can't have a wrist vibrato you're

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.259 
really can't have a wrist vibrato you're
limited<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:21.150> finger<00:00:22.080> vibrato<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.269> that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
limited to a finger vibrato and that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.099 
limited to a finger vibrato and that
involves<00:00:24.930> getting<00:00:25.140> control<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
involves getting control over this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.510 
involves getting control over this
knuckle<00:00:29.090> okay<00:00:30.090> most<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> us<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.340> any

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
knuckle okay most of us don't have any

now most people when they try to do this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.709 
now most people when they try to do this
their<00:00:48.329> fingers<00:00:48.809> snaps<00:00:49.320> watch<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.010> ah<00:00:53.690> here<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
their fingers snaps watch this ah here I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.160 
their fingers snaps watch this ah here I
can<00:00:54.960> demonstrate<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.500> better<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.890> this<00:01:00.170> do

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
can demonstrate it better like this do

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.050 
can demonstrate it better like this do
you<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.500> snap<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:04.140> bad

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
you see this snap that's bad

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
you see this snap that's bad
what<00:01:06.060> we're<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> try<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> train

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
what we're going to try to do is train

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
what we're going to try to do is train
yourself<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> snap<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
yourself to not do that snap so what you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.920 
yourself to not do that snap so what you
have<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.170> start<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.830> very

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
have to do first is start with very

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.920 
have to do first is start with very
minimal<00:01:15.930> pressure<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.220> finger

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
minimal pressure with your finger

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
minimal pressure with your finger
start<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.110> any<00:01:19.650> finger<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.549> choice<00:01:20.850> I'm

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
start with any finger of your choice I'm

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
start with any finger of your choice I'm
going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> start<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
going to start with this one it's the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
going to start with this one it's the
one<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> broke<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:25.740> little

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
one I broke so I have very little

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.020 
one I broke so I have very little
control<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.869> knuckle<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.759> see

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
control over that knuckle you can see

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
control over that knuckle you can see
where<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.329> crooked<00:01:30.540> long<00:01:31.470> story<00:01:31.829> okay<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
where it's crooked long story okay so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.490 
where it's crooked long story okay so
you're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> work<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> slowly

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.929 

you

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.370 

and<00:01:44.030> add<00:01:44.780> pressure<00:01:45.289> just<00:01:46.100> slightly<00:01:47.380> enough

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
and add pressure just slightly enough

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.709 
and add pressure just slightly enough
cyllid<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> bends<00:01:49.749> smoothly<00:01:52.270> I'd<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.659> a

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
cyllid it bends smoothly I'd like it a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.719 
cyllid it bends smoothly I'd like it a
little<00:01:53.990> smoother<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:56.109> you<00:01:57.109> can<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.250> tilt

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
little smoother and you can you can tilt

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.639 
little smoother and you can you can tilt
the<00:01:59.090> pad<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.569> your<00:01:59.600> finger<00:01:59.719> to<00:02:00.200> help<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.619> a

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
the pad of your finger to help you a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:09.249 
the pad of your finger to help you a
little<00:02:01.189> bit<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:04.390> then<00:02:05.390> back<00:02:05.689> up<00:02:06.459> down<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:08.259> it

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
little bit and then back up down and it

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
little bit and then back up down and it
can<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.619> done<00:02:09.860> with<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.129> lot<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.599> concentration

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
can be done with a lot of concentration

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.530 
can be done with a lot of concentration
it<00:02:12.440> does<00:02:12.680> take<00:02:12.980> concentration<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.970> overcome

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it does take concentration to overcome

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.630 
it does take concentration to overcome
that<00:02:14.780> urge<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:16.730> snap<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.370> learn

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
that urge to just snap you have to learn

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.660 
that urge to just snap you have to learn
where<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.000> threshold<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.489> get

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
where your threshold is then as you get

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.690 
where your threshold is then as you get
better<00:02:22.910> at<00:02:23.269> this<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:24.200> start<00:02:24.470> adding<00:02:24.739> pressure

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
better at this you start adding pressure

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.900 
better at this you start adding pressure
oh<00:02:27.220> I'm<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:29.140> overdid<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.370> you'll<00:02:31.370> your<00:02:31.700> body

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
oh I'm I overdid it you'll your body

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.490 
oh I'm I overdid it you'll your body
will<00:02:32.150> tell<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.569> if<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.870> added<00:02:33.170> too<00:02:33.379> much

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
will tell you if you added too much

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.220 
will tell you if you added too much
pressure<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:35.209> won't<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.569> able<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.780> prevent<00:02:36.079> it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
pressure you won't be able to prevent it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.490 
pressure you won't be able to prevent it
from<00:02:36.410> snapping<00:02:37.359> so<00:02:38.359> add<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.569> little<00:02:39.109> bit<00:02:39.260> less

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
from snapping so add a little bit less

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.680 
from snapping so add a little bit less
pressure<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:44.450> can't<00:02:44.840> snap<00:02:45.260> down<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.690> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
pressure and it can't snap down and it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.620 
pressure and it can't snap down and it
also<00:02:47.870> can't<00:02:48.319> snap<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.239> shows

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
also can't snap up because that shows

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.210 
also can't snap up because that shows
lack<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.410> control<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.910> add<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.239> little<00:02:53.690> pressure
