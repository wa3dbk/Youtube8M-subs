r they're not as I guess rugged is the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.910 
r they're not as I guess rugged is the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
way that you could call it they step

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
way that you could call it they step
down<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> couple<00:00:29.519> different<00:00:29.609> features<00:00:30.300> but

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
down in a couple different features but

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
down in a couple different features but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
sound but at a much much lower price tag

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
sound but at a much much lower price tag
so<00:00:38.010> let's<00:00:38.190> take<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> look<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> DB<00:00:39.030> RS<00:00:39.360> let's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so let's take a look at the DB RS let's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.119 
so let's take a look at the DB RS let's
see<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> differences<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
see what some of the differences are and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
see what some of the differences are and
then<00:00:41.489> we'll<00:00:41.610> talk<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.090> sound

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
then we'll talk about sound

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610 
then we'll talk about sound
now<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> DBR<00:00:45.600> uses<00:00:45.990> a<00:00:46.020> different<00:00:46.470> type<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
now the DBR uses a different type of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560 
now the DBR uses a different type of
plastic<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.250> DXR<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.060> know<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.390> also

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
plastic the DXR as you know is also

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.390 
plastic the DXR as you know is also
plastic<00:00:48.900> as<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.290> but<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.770> one's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.130> little

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
plastic as well but this one's a little

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.480 
plastic as well but this one's a little
bit<00:00:50.520> thinner<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.330> not<00:00:51.630> as<00:00:51.870> resistant<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:53.220> far

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
bit thinner it's not as resistant as far

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.700 
bit thinner it's not as resistant as far
as<00:00:53.700> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.330> if<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> drop<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.350> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as you know of you if you drop this this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.960 
as you know of you if you drop this this
thing<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.220> dent<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.640> you've<00:00:56.790> got<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
thing is going to dent so you've got a

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.480 
thing is going to dent so you've got a
baby<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.810> bit<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.010> nothing

honestly it's just you know any kind of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.300 
honestly it's just you know any kind of
speaker<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.740> baby<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
but the big difference of course as far

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.650 
but the big difference of course as far
as<00:01:07.620> looks<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> front<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.570> bit

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
as looks as the front just a little bit

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.330 
as looks as the front just a little bit

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
way around you're going to get a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.080 
way around you're going to get a
beautiful<00:01:52.650> sound<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> we'll<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.820> more

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
beautiful sound out of it we'll go more

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
beautiful sound out of it we'll go more
on<00:01:54.150> sound<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.690> just<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.990> moment<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> big

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
on sound in just a moment one of the big

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.000 
on sound in just a moment one of the big
differences<00:01:56.310> comes<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.200> wattage<00:01:58.830> I

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
differences comes in with the wattage I

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.160 
differences comes in with the wattage I
mean<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> DX<00:01:59.610> r10<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> very<00:02:00.570> high<00:02:00.810> powered

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
mean the DX r10 is a very high powered

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.710 
mean the DX r10 is a very high powered
speaker<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.040> guy<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.729> much<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.540> for

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
speaker this guy not so much so for

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.350 
speaker this guy not so much so for
example<00:02:04.260> just<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> show<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.220> on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.550> specs<00:02:06.210> on

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
example just to show you on the specs on

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
example just to show you on the specs on
this<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.960> continuous<00:02:07.590> wattage<00:02:08.010> of<00:02:08.130> this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
this one the continuous wattage of this

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
this one the continuous wattage of this
one<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.660> 325<00:02:09.660> watts<00:02:10.019> or<00:02:10.200> 700<00:02:11.160> P<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> 325

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
one is 325 watts or 700 P but the 325

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.560 
one is 325 watts or 700 P but the 325
continuous<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.190> 260<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
continuous we have 260 going to the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.110 
continuous we have 260 going to the
woofer<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.530> 65<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> highs

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
woofer and then 65 going to the highs

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.020 
woofer and then 65 going to the highs
now<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.080> may<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.650> sound<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.040> lot<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
now that may not sound a lot lot to you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.440 
now that may not sound a lot lot to you
but<00:02:21.510> again<00:02:21.540> wattage<00:02:22.530> means<00:02:22.830> nothing<00:02:23.610> what's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
but again wattage means nothing what's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.780 
but again wattage means nothing what's
important<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.049> me<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.709> specs<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.670> know

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
important to me is the specs or you know

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.759 
important to me is the specs or you know
the<00:02:26.910> SPL<00:02:27.390> how<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.080> actual<00:02:28.590> output

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
the SPL how we know what actual output

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.830 
the SPL how we know what actual output
are<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.070> looking<00:02:29.340> at<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.580> peak<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:30.600> about<00:02:30.780> a

we have a lot of the same features as a
DX<00:02:53.880> R<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> DSR<00:02:54.900> series<00:02:55.349> let's<00:02:55.709> take<00:02:55.860> a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
DX R and the DSR series let's take a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.360 
DX R and the DSR series let's take a
look

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.220 
we have the channel 1 through 2 or the
mix<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.170> again<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.129> just<00:03:25.430> literally<00:03:26.230> mix

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
mix so again you can just literally mix

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.770 
mix so again you can just literally mix
in<00:03:27.440> where<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.799> says<00:03:27.980> channel<00:03:28.400> 1<00:03:28.549> only<00:03:29.060> that

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
in where it says channel 1 only that

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.789 
in where it says channel 1 only that
outputs<00:03:30.260> here<00:03:30.560> or<00:03:30.739> channel<00:03:31.670> 1<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.510> mix<00:03:33.079> so

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
outputs here or channel 1 and to mix so

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.080 
outputs here or channel 1 and to mix so
for<00:03:34.430> example<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.030> I'm<00:03:35.180> doing<00:03:35.540> let's<00:03:35.780> say<00:03:36.079> a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
for example if I'm doing let's say a

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.640 
for example if I'm doing let's say a
ceremony<00:03:38.090> system<00:03:38.569> right<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.959> for<00:03:39.349> one<00:03:39.470> reason

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
ceremony system right and for one reason

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.490 
ceremony system right and for one reason
or<00:03:39.829> another<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.280> only<00:03:40.579> want<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.269> output<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
or another I only want it to output the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.710 
or another I only want it to output the
microphone<00:03:43.159> only<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.909> second<00:03:44.329> one<00:03:44.480> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
microphone only to the second one and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.750 
microphone only to the second one and
have<00:03:44.900> music<00:03:45.290> going<00:03:45.319> only<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.159> of<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.430> one

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
have music going only out of this one

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.580 
have music going only out of this one
I'd<00:03:47.030> have<00:03:47.209> my<00:03:47.329> music<00:03:47.390> here<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.079> my<00:03:48.409> microphone

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
I'd have my music here and my microphone

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.130 
I'd have my music here and my microphone
here<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.459> would<00:03:49.879> let<00:03:50.030> go<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
here I would let go of this and the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.530 
here I would let go of this and the
microphone<00:03:51.650> only<00:03:52.099> would<00:03:52.519> output<00:03:52.970> out<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.359> that

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
microphone only would output out of that

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.360 
microphone only would output out of that
into<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.079> next<00:03:54.319> speaker<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:55.099> a<00:03:55.190> pretty

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
into the next speaker it's a pretty

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.490 
into the next speaker it's a pretty
creative<00:03:55.700> feature<00:03:56.090> which<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.319> know<00:03:57.440> at

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
creative feature which I'm you know at

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.899 
creative feature which I'm you know at
some<00:03:57.620> point<00:03:57.859> or<00:03:57.950> another<00:03:57.980> would<00:03:58.489> really<00:03:58.700> come

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
some point or another would really come

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.610 
some point or another would really come
in<00:03:59.000> handy<00:03:59.329> on<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.930> right<00:04:00.079> hand<00:04:00.260> side<00:04:00.349> of

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
course we've got a DSP with the D

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.009 
course we've got a DSP with the D
contour<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:03.260> contour<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:03.829> we've<00:04:04.010> got<00:04:04.190> your

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
contour the contour here we've got your

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.509 
contour the contour here we've got your
front-of-house<00:04:06.019> main<00:04:06.530> option<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.099> have<00:04:07.250> off

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
front-of-house main option you have off

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.729 
front-of-house main option you have off
or<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.239> use<00:04:08.389> it<00:04:08.419> as<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> monitor<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.349> it

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
or you can use it as a monitor and it

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.099 
or you can use it as a monitor and it
shows<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.190> little<00:04:10.400> graphical<00:04:11.120> version<00:04:11.720> of

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
shows you a little graphical version of

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.949 
shows you a little graphical version of
what<00:04:12.349> each<00:04:12.650> contour<00:04:13.609> option<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.419> then<00:04:14.810> you

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
what each contour option is and then you

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.319 
what each contour option is and then you
have<00:04:15.139> your<00:04:15.410> high<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:15.859> power-cut<00:04:16.609> are<00:04:16.820> your

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
have your high a power-cut are your

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.390 
have your high a power-cut are your
basically<00:04:18.109> your<00:04:18.289> bass<00:04:18.440> cutoff<00:04:18.769> here<00:04:18.979> so<00:04:19.310> you

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
basically your bass cutoff here so you

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.710 
basically your bass cutoff here so you
can<00:04:19.519> have<00:04:19.579> at<00:04:19.700> zero<00:04:20.109> 100<00:04:21.109> Hertz<00:04:21.349> or<00:04:21.669> 120<00:04:22.669> I've<00:04:23.180> I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
can have at zero 100 Hertz or 120 I've I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.650 
can have at zero 100 Hertz or 120 I've I
mostly<00:04:24.380> use<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.770> at<00:04:24.919> 100<00:04:25.729> just<00:04:26.180> because<00:04:26.419> with

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
mostly use it at 100 just because with

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.760 
mostly use it at 100 just because with
some<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.020> cocktail<00:04:27.349> music<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> play

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
some of the cocktail music that I play

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.770 
some of the cocktail music that I play
has<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.070> much<00:04:28.340> lower<00:04:28.580> bass<00:04:28.940> notes<00:04:29.210> on<00:04:29.419> there<00:04:29.599> and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
has a much lower bass notes on there and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.510 
has a much lower bass notes on there and
it's<00:04:30.169> not<00:04:30.289> it<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.770> distorts<00:04:31.160> or<00:04:31.400> anything

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's not it that it distorts or anything

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.490 
it's not it that it distorts or anything
like<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.789> but<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.360> get<00:04:32.599> nicer<00:04:33.020> sound<00:04:33.260> when

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
like that but I get nicer sound when

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.070 
like that but I get nicer sound when
it's<00:04:33.620> at<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.770> hundred<00:04:34.220> if<00:04:35.060> I'm<00:04:35.240> using<00:04:35.419> subs<00:04:35.840> of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
it's at a hundred if I'm using subs of

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.960 
it's at a hundred if I'm using subs of
course<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.620> keep<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.830> at<00:04:36.889> 100<00:04:37.250> 120

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
course I would keep it at 100 120

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.430 
course I would keep it at 100 120
depending<00:04:38.300> how<00:04:38.389> we've<00:04:38.539> crossed<00:04:38.780> over<00:04:39.110> and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
depending how we've crossed over and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.680 
depending how we've crossed over and
then<00:04:40.010> for<00:04:40.190> ceremonies<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.789> usually<00:04:41.150> have<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.389> at

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
then for ceremonies I usually have it at

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.040 
then for ceremonies I usually have it at
zero<00:04:42.849> so<00:04:43.849> when<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> first<00:04:44.240> saw<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.510> DVR

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
zero so when I first saw the DVR

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.260 
zero so when I first saw the DVR
speakers<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.919> then<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.039> saw<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.310> DX<00:04:46.729> ours<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
speakers and then I saw the DX ours and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.879 
speakers and then I saw the DX ours and
the<00:04:47.360> D<00:04:47.510> SRS<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.080> owned<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.410> other<00:04:48.560> two<00:04:48.740> as

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
the D SRS and I owned the other two as

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.240 
the D SRS and I owned the other two as
well<00:04:49.120> my<00:04:50.120> main<00:04:50.360> concern<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:50.810> if<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.289> go<00:04:51.590> with<00:04:51.979> a

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
well my main concern is if I go with a

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.460 
well my main concern is if I go with a
cheaper<00:04:52.789> speaker<00:04:53.240> am<00:04:53.419> i<00:04:53.539> sacrificing<00:04:53.780> sound

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
cheaper speaker am i sacrificing sound

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.920 
cheaper speaker am i sacrificing sound
quality<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.220> answer's<00:04:55.550> no<00:04:55.580> now<00:04:56.539> there<00:04:56.780> are

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
quality the answer's no now there are

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.320 
quality the answer's no now there are
little<00:04:57.650> slight<00:04:58.099> differences<00:04:58.789> in<00:04:58.849> terms<00:04:59.180> of

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
little slight differences in terms of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.610 
little slight differences in terms of
sound<00:04:59.510> especially<00:04:59.599> at<00:04:59.990> higher<00:05:00.169> volumes

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
sound especially at higher volumes

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.140 
sound especially at higher volumes
because<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.310> other<00:05:01.460> two<00:05:01.610> speakers<00:05:01.820> can

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
because the other two speakers can

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.570 
because the other two speakers can
handle<00:05:02.539> much<00:05:03.199> more<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.770> know<00:05:03.919> sound<00:05:04.250> or<00:05:04.550> you

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
handle much more you know sound or you
