00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
go searching for the geocache so we have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
go searching for the geocache so we have
a<00:01:10.860> few<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.310> we've<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.610> recorded<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a few that we've actually recorded to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.399 
a few that we've actually recorded to
the<00:01:12.600> device<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the device here now we can see the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
the device here now we can see the
closest<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.220> apparently<00:01:18.140> stinky<00:01:19.140> forever

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
closest one is apparently stinky forever

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
closest one is apparently stinky forever
I<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> go

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I don't really think we want to go

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
I don't really think we want to go
finding<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.930> diamond<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> rough

finding that one diamond in the rough

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.140 
finding that one diamond in the rough
that<00:01:22.710> sounds<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.220> better<00:01:23.490> that's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that sounds a little better that's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
that sounds a little better that's
apparently<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.689> four<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> half<00:01:25.200> miles

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
apparently about four and a half miles

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.569 
apparently about four and a half miles
away<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> description

now this this menu item here this

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.380 
now this this menu item here this
demonstrates<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.560> yet

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
demonstrates that we have not yet

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.580 
demonstrates that we have not yet
attempted<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> find<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.780> cache

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
attempted to find this cache

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.160 
attempted to find this cache
now<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.370> go<00:02:14.670> through<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.170> note

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
now we can actually go through and note

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
now we can actually go through and note
that<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.440> found<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.310> say<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.580> haven't

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that we found it we can say we haven't

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.869 
that we found it we can say we haven't
found<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.019> say<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> cache<00:02:20.430> needs

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
found it we can say that the cache needs

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.780 
found it we can say that the cache needs
maintenance<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.660> if<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.069> Tupperware

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
maintenance so if the if the Tupperware

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.780 
maintenance so if the if the Tupperware
container<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.330> broken<00:02:24.599> down<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:26.489> cache

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
container is broken down and the cache

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.610 
container is broken down and the cache
itself<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.360> falling<00:02:27.660> apart<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.470> can

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
itself is falling apart we can we can

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.559 
itself is falling apart we can we can
note<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.950> here<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.459> can<00:02:29.849> also<00:02:29.970> enter<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.330> note

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
note that here we can also enter a note

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.440 
note that here we can also enter a note
about<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.670> experience<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
about the about the experience of

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.289 
about the about the experience of
finding<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.870> cache<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.700> all<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.970> stuff<00:02:36.180> will

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
finding the cache now all the stuff will

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.449 
finding the cache now all the stuff will
be<00:02:36.420> uploaded<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.900> geocaching<00:02:37.799> comm<00:02:38.160> when<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
be uploaded to geocaching comm when we

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.009 
be uploaded to geocaching comm when we
actually<00:02:38.760> connect<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.480> service<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> we

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
actually connect to that service so we

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.130 
actually connect to that service so we
can't<00:02:43.230> actually<00:02:43.349> use<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.950> device<00:02:44.220> as<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:45.360> just

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
can't actually use the device as a just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.430 
can't actually use the device as a just
a<00:02:46.230> dedicated<00:02:46.650> GPS<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.430> want<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
a dedicated GPS if we want to to do that

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.800 
a dedicated GPS if we want to to do that
we'll<00:02:49.680> need<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.130> into<00:02:50.489> either<00:02:51.060> waypoints

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
we'll need to go into either waypoints

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.400 
we'll need to go into either waypoints
or<00:02:51.989> into<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.880> maps<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.260> our

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
or into the maps here so we can see our

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.809 
or into the maps here so we can see our
current<00:02:58.739> location<00:02:58.829> we're<00:02:59.400> not<00:02:59.519> we're

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
current location we're not we're

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.580 
current location we're not we're
actually<00:02:59.879> in<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.209> studio<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:00.840> having<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
actually in the studio so it's having a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.369 
actually in the studio so it's having a
hard<00:03:01.739> time<00:03:01.799> finding<00:03:02.190> our<00:03:02.489> actual<00:03:02.760> location

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
hard time finding our actual location

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.930 
hard time finding our actual location
but<00:03:04.379> we<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.709> use<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.519> you've<00:03:05.640> ever<00:03:05.760> used

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
but we can use it if you've ever used

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
but we can use it if you've ever used
