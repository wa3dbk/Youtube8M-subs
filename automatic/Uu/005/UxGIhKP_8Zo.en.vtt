00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 Cuckoo is amel bent on urban mergers 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.520
 not miss it 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.520
 palermo I think I have so much 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.460
 I think I chose to call this 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.750
 album a stop because because we 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.380
 always looking when we want to give a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.669
 name an album a thread 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.989
 actually when you listened 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.199
 the album I know there is no thread 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.970
 musical conductor since there is no 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.830
 a song that looks like another 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 it's by an album all I add warren 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.530
 August 10th or not so I was thinking is this 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.339
 what is it that gave the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.290
 title of a song it was going to be 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.190
 interesting there was this song 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.760
 instinct who who who for me in 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.470
 the meaning explained a little the approach of 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
 this album is to say here 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.540
 trust that in this sixth sense and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.320
 evolve as sacred went to meet 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.760
 people without thinking without 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.619
 intellectualize just by feeling the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 things by being really oneself at 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.850
 closer to his truth and for me 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.360
 it's instinct when we do the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.360
 things at the moment 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 look at us there for me inside 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 of me it's not it's not a shock because 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 that people who know me people 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.540
 with whom I go out people people with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.610
 who I spend nights at home my 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 family my friends and his looks from us 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 it does not shock them at all because 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 it's me it's me when I'm not in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 singing sad songs and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 when I'm not in my anxieties and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.980
 in the past and it is on the contrary all 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.080
 the world tells me but when do you 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.390
 go make pieces that my kiki who 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.180
 show your audience did not you that that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.729
 anxious and anxious and stress with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 the call and that's me I did not want I 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.640
 did not want to make pieces like 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 look at us because I did not see 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170
 the interest of making pieces that do not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170
 tell nothing 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.470
 it's not even simple it's simple 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.299
 the text etc I found that it was 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.810
 mess makes songs like that in 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.520
 his album 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.420
 and then after 10 years and after 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.560
 four albums I told myself but 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 finally if I have no pieces like 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.610
 that people will never have this part 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.170
 of me who is lighter this part 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.440
 from me who is very energetic the joy of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.060
 to live positivity and I told myself 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.350
 but eventually I'm dead to them because 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.970
 life is not that pain the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.239
 sadness and grief life it's also 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.370
 lightness life is also laughter 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.620
 and the joy of living and so it's for 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.900
 me in the eyes of us it's me 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.130
 when in fact it's me too but it's 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.480
 a month that I never wanted to show 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.480
 that I show that now 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.659
 Beyoncé is not my idol but I have 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.760
 a lot of admiration for her I 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.000
 find it's an amazing artist 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.010
 a model a model of both woman 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.400
 and artist is the showgirl by 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.540
 excellence but I have g but as 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.470
 like as have been 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 britney spears jennifer lopez madonna 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.359
 it's all these women it's all these 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.430
 women who is dancing and singing 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.870
 and that make you dream necessarily they 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.159
 become references that are 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.829
 references after actually my body 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.500
 is serious the crisis he is a fan of beyonce 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.879
 they adore beyoncé he loves he loves 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.959
 so suddenly actually when he goes 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.030
 do me a choreography there will be 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.670
 also he'll go see the influences 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.200
 of each other and we 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.280
 find after me I will not say 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.500
 yeah i have a bndes choreography 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.599
 it's actually that's it's stop 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.189
 we were between gillot and b2c we wanted 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.849
 must be in accordance with 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.620
 my physique 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.540
 I do not have the body of Britney nor the body 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.019
 madonna bah I still have no 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.370
 athletic 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.629
 so it's the shapes it's the curves 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.480
 so we'll get them into more trouble 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.519
 Latino for the purpose of hung and etc 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.049
 and of course we're going right now 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.819
 bridge with a beyoncé that's 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.889
 normal but it does not bother my novel 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.870
 it's the ultimate reference it's michael 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.030
 jackson female and if we must have 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.799
 a model when we sing and want 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.299
 to dance at the same time I needed it 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.709
 have to go watch them take it 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.790
 best models and well we do not know 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.780
 for me it's the best of the models 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.040
 it's the one that makes it the wall 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.030
 and I am 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.130
 a brutus deal 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.940
 it's not really that complicated anymore 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.260
 I invited ne-yo on my album not that 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.970
 because he's a great singer 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.760
 did it because I wanted to 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.650
 works the melody together but 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.290
 I wanted us to work the 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.280
 heart arrangements together I have 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.050
 price because it is I exchange 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.590
 price it seemed like he had a 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.360
 final casting youtube is taken bravo no 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 I invited because I wanted him 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.580
 brings me his composers experience 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.930
 and authors I had no I had 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.340
 a melody but some I was not 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.070
 fan of the melody on the song that 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.150
 I had then at the moment change 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.470
 this springboard dances with the stars we 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.420
 came to paris recorded this title 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.140
 then this is me right now that's what 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.240
 I am living 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.590
 I would like to talk about it is what you 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.420
 can help me and know how to write 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800
 together so ne-yo it was really 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.270
 because here he is a composer of 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340
 sick we have to say it 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.980
 written to ask for beyoncé for 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.980

 can make melodies write for 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.780
 singers so here I wanted I 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.760
 wanted to play 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.570
 I wanted I wanted to enjoy everything 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.570
 what he can do in fact 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.290
 we always have a favorite song in 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.570
 his album to each album I had my 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.010
 favorite songs 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.110
 on this fifth album is the times 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.800
 who run the times that run because 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.970
 that because that's when when it's 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.470
 to try one of the only ones I have 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.820
 not written elsewhere it's françois 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.970
 welgryn who knows me very well with 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.790
 who has been writing since the first album 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.080
 called me who told me here I got you 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.520
 write a song already that's it 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.510
 wonderful when someone write to you 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.340
 a song it's not like you when 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.840
 you are given a song I listen to the 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.870
 song I'm so crying 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.980
 I say to myself but in fact we defend even 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.560
 a song because there is a sentence 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.450
 who looks like us and we're going to love 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.550
 a song here for a sentence me 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.560
 every word I heard was 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.820
 it was me it was but I called them 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.290
 I was in tears on Thursday but something 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.750
 crazy french what did you do what you 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.790
 wrote this song it upsets me 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.980
 it upsets me today I the 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.419
 sing every second I cry because 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.760
 that really ugly the emotional charge 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.750
 she went from one is actually 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.060
 I like it I would have liked it to be my 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.410
 first single on sape was possible 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.440
 because we see it here if you want to be in 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.169
 radio let's not get out a song 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.720
 like that but that's it for me this is the 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.800
 song from the album and 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.659
 and I will fight for a few cases 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.520
 for it to exist in single because 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.870
 I really want like that people 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.949
 do not miss this song and 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.750
 it's not pretentious because it's 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.620
 not even me doing so but the 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.030
 really I think they did a 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.080
 extraordinary work on this chance 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:53.849
 it's too beautiful it's I love yes I have 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.849
 not want to stay there 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.550
 m 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.949
 kalyna is that he is never such the 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.710
 know and I say it all the time it's 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.219
 for me one of the most beautiful voices 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.330
 one of the most beautiful French voice is 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:14.349
 when we know it when we know the 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.840
 woman we discover a soul as beautiful 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.310
 that her voice she went awesome and 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.960
 actually means with whom I could 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.909
 I really want to sing 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.189
 and actually I had found 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.879
 pieces but that I like and more and 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.379
 it is therefore 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.270
 so we're going to do this duo we 're going to 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:30.370
