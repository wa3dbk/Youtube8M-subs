okay I'm welcome back we have here and I
am<00:00:11.099> as<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> ball<00:00:11.610> Glock<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> uPVC<00:00:12.960> doors

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
am as the ball Glock for the uPVC doors

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
am as the ball Glock for the uPVC doors
as<00:00:13.559> discussed<00:00:14.490> earlier

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
as discussed earlier

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
as discussed earlier
I'm<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> show<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.680> how

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
I'm not we're going to show you is how

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.279 
I'm not we're going to show you is how
to<00:00:16.920> actually<00:00:17.400> change<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.940> code<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:19.050> ball

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
to actually change the code on this ball

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.400 
to actually change the code on this ball
Glock<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> will<00:00:20.640> notice<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.380> we<00:00:22.380> have

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Glock now you will notice that we have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
Glock now you will notice that we have
one<00:00:22.949> two<00:00:23.490> three<00:00:24.240> four<00:00:24.779> five<00:00:25.350> six<00:00:26.510> combinations

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
one two three four five six combinations

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
one two three four five six combinations
that<00:00:27.750> therefore<00:00:28.470> tells<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that therefore tells you that's the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.620 
that therefore tells you that's the
numbers<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.720> three<00:00:31.140> four<00:00:31.500> five<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.160> six

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
numbers one two three four five and six

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260 
numbers one two three four five and six
at<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> moment<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.320> time<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> code<00:00:35.700> as

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
at this moment in time we have a code as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.770 
at this moment in time we have a code as
programmed<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.110> four<00:00:37.800> three<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:38.790> six<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.390> if

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
programmed as four three two six so if

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
programmed as four three two six so if
we<00:00:39.960> put<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> four<00:00:40.829> three<00:00:41.489> two<00:00:42.230> six<00:00:44.780> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
we put in four three two six that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.889 
we put in four three two six that
operates<00:00:46.879> I'll<00:00:47.879> try<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.120> again<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
operates I'll try that again just to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.229 
operates I'll try that again just to
show<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.789> cam<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
show you if you look there that cam is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.470 
show you if you look there that cam is
not<00:00:51.360> moving<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> number<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.480> four

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
not moving if I put the number in four

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.939 
not moving if I put the number in four
three<00:00:55.020> two<00:00:55.520> six<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> cam<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.620> there

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
three two six look at the cam and there

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.439 
three two six look at the cam and there
you<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> operate<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> latch

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you go that's going to operate the latch

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.049 
you go that's going to operate the latch
okay<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:03.030> about

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
okay so how do we actually go about

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.390 
okay so how do we actually go about
changing<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> code<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.710> most<00:01:04.949> important

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
changing the code the most important

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
changing the code the most important
thing<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.229> clear<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
thing to do first of all is to clear the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
thing to do first of all is to clear the
chamber<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.000> clear<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> chamber<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
chamber so to clear the chamber that you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
chamber so to clear the chamber that you
need<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> operate<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> handle<00:01:11.340> down<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
need to operate the handle down and that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
need to operate the handle down and that
clears<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> chamber<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.070> no

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
clears all the chamber so there's no

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
clears all the chamber so there's no
buttons<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.880> been<00:01:15.090> pressed<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.470> need

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
buttons have been pressed what you need

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580 
buttons have been pressed what you need
to<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> write<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:19.080> number

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to then do is to write down what number

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.060 
to then do is to write down what number
you're<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.600> code<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.650> get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you're going to have as your code so get

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
you're going to have as your code so get
yourself<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.520> piece<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.700> paper<00:01:23.939> we'll<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
yourself a piece of paper we'll put that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
yourself a piece of paper we'll put that
down<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> second<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
down for a second and we think to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
down for a second and we think to
ourselves<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.700> number<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.750> we're

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
ourselves what is the number that we're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.460 
ourselves what is the number that we're
gonna<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.020> us<00:01:31.229> for

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
gonna have so I think we for for us for

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
gonna have so I think we for for us for
demonstration<00:01:32.220> purposes<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.060> have

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
demonstration purposes we're gonna have

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.100 
demonstration purposes we're gonna have
the<00:01:33.540> code<00:01:33.890> three<00:01:35.240> four<00:01:36.560> one<00:01:38.150> six<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.810> going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the code three four one six that's going

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
the code three four one six that's going
to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> code<00:01:40.759> now<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> important<00:01:42.360> thing

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to be the code now the important thing

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.380 
to be the code now the important thing
that<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.500> need<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.970> system

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that we need to do or what this system

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
that we need to do or what this system
runs<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> costars<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.850> sequential

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
runs the costars is they are sequential

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.679 
runs the costars is they are sequential
so<00:01:49.409> when<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.829> want<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> program<00:01:50.369> three<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.420> has

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so when we want a program three it has

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.620 
so when we want a program three it has
to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.020> free<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.590> being<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> first<00:01:53.220> code<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to be free as being the first code the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.969 
to be free as being the first code the
way<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.640> need<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> lift<00:01:57.270> up

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
way to do this is we need to lift up

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.910 
way to do this is we need to lift up
this<00:01:58.979> chamber<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.649> move

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this chamber here like these and move

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
this chamber here like these and move
that<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:03.000> indicator<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.110> little

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that little indicator there that little

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
that little indicator there that little
knob<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.189> know<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.490> can

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
knob you all there I know if you can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
knob you all there I know if you can
zoom<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.149> close<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.869> off<00:02:07.020> alright

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
zoom in that close there go off alright

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.190 
zoom in that close there go off alright
move<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:08.970> knob<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> later<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
move that little knob you later to the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.520 
move that little knob you later to the
to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> center<00:02:11.430> line<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> right<00:02:12.690> hand

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to the center line it on the right hand

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.050 
to the center line it on the right hand
red<00:02:14.490> mark<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.800> first<00:02:17.100> number<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
red mark so the first number in the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.470 
red mark so the first number in the
sequence<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.720> 3<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.560> 3<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> third<00:02:20.520> chamber

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
sequence is 3 so 3 is the third chamber

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.530 
sequence is 3 so 3 is the third chamber
down<00:02:21.630> 1<00:02:21.990> 2<00:02:22.290> 3<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.850> need<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
down 1 2 3 so what we need to do is to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.310 
down 1 2 3 so what we need to do is to
lift<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:26.220> move<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.730> over<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
lift that up and move it over so it's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.010 
lift that up and move it over so it's
right<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> red<00:02:29.280> mark<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.540> pin

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
right on that red mark that little pin

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.350 
right on that red mark that little pin
inside<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:32.010> sitting<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.640> red<00:02:32.880> mark<00:02:33.120> on

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
inside there is sitting that red mark on

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
inside there is sitting that red mark on
the<00:02:33.450> right<00:02:33.630> hand<00:02:33.870> side<00:02:33.990> once<00:02:34.740> you've<00:02:34.890> done

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the right hand side once you've done

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.930 
the right hand side once you've done
that<00:02:35.310> press<00:02:35.850> 3

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
that press 3

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.090 
that press 3
the<00:02:38.940> next<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.600> number<00:02:40.110> 4<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.740> 1<00:02:41.130> 2<00:02:41.670> 3<00:02:41.700> 4<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.950> what

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the next is number 4 so 1 2 3 4 so what

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
the next is number 4 so 1 2 3 4 so what
we<00:02:44.220> need<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.580> again<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.330> lift<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.750> up

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
we need to do again is to lift that up

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
we need to do again is to lift that up
and<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.340> case<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.760> need<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> move<00:02:48.150> it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and in this case we need to move it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.020 
and in this case we need to move it
slightly<00:02:48.630> over<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.370> fingers<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.880> this

have to lift this one up move it right
over<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.590> course<00:03:19.620> I'm<00:03:19.980> trying<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.670> at

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
over of course I'm trying to do this at

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.390 
over of course I'm trying to do this at
the<00:03:20.940> same<00:03:21.120> time<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:22.050> show<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.350> because<00:03:23.220> I'd

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the same time to show you because I'd

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.890 
the same time to show you because I'd
have<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:24.000> front<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.360> me<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.690> would<00:03:24.780> be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
have this in front of me and it would be

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.050 
have this in front of me and it would be
a<00:03:24.930> lot<00:03:25.110> easier<00:03:25.400> that's<00:03:26.400> number<00:03:26.550> 1<00:03:26.820> press

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
a lot easier that's number 1 press

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.960 
a lot easier that's number 1 press
number<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.160> number<00:03:29.190> six<00:03:29.610> which<00:03:29.850> is

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
number one and then number six which is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.720 
number one and then number six which is
right<00:03:30.150> down<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.390> bottom<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:32.340> need<00:03:32.550> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
right down the bottom here we need to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.920 
right down the bottom here we need to
move<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.150> one<00:03:33.300> over<00:03:35.330> so<00:03:36.330> he's<00:03:36.570> sitting<00:03:36.750> right

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
move that one over so he's sitting right

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
move that one over so he's sitting right
there<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.500> press<00:03:37.680> 6<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.760> you'll<00:03:39.540> hear<00:03:39.840> that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
there and press 6 and you'll hear that

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.710 
there and press 6 and you'll hear that
defined<00:03:40.590> click<00:03:41.160> because<00:03:41.970> we've<00:03:42.360> programmed

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
defined click because we've programmed

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.090 
defined click because we've programmed
this<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.440> four<00:03:43.739> digit<00:03:43.980> system<00:03:46.100> and

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
this to be a four digit system and

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.610 
this to be a four digit system and
therefore<00:03:47.580> then<00:03:47.820> we<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.720> now<00:03:48.930> programmed

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
therefore then we have now programmed

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.170 
therefore then we have now programmed
the<00:03:49.799> fourth<00:03:50.070> digit<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:50.910> will<00:03:51.000> hear

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
the fourth digit in and you will hear

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.449 
the fourth digit in and you will hear
that<00:03:51.360> define<00:03:51.810> click<00:03:52.110> if<00:03:52.620> we<00:03:52.830> now<00:03:52.980> press<00:03:53.280> this

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
that define click if we now press this

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.820 
that define click if we now press this
down<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.630> resets<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> Chamber's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
down that resets the Chamber's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.979 
down that resets the Chamber's
everything's<00:03:56.670> fine<00:03:56.940> okay

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
everything's fine okay

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.350 
everything's fine okay
and<00:03:58.080> now<00:03:59.010> if<00:03:59.190> we<00:03:59.310> put<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.670> number<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.150> now

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and now if we put that number in now

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.080 
and now if we put that number in now
which<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.840> three<00:04:02.420> four<00:04:03.470> one<00:04:04.640> six<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.910> hear

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
which is three four one six you hear

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.449 
which is three four one six you hear
that<00:04:06.299> define<00:04:06.660> click<00:04:07.019> pressed<00:04:07.769> it<00:04:07.950> down<00:04:07.980> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
that define click pressed it down and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.420 
that define click pressed it down and
you<00:04:08.670> can<00:04:08.850> see<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.870> cam<00:04:10.170> rotated<00:04:10.860> again

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
you can see that that cam rotated again

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.979 
you can see that that cam rotated again
you<00:04:11.580> want<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.790> try<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.180> few<00:04:12.209> times<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
you want to try it a few times just to

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.770 
you want to try it a few times just to
make<00:04:13.080> sure<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.459> actually<00:04:14.700> working

that you do to is to get the chamber and
to<00:04:45.600> lift<00:04:45.960> them<00:04:46.140> up<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.850> pop<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.150> little<00:04:48.450> blue

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
to lift them up and pop the little blue

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.530 
to lift them up and pop the little blue
knob<00:04:48.900> jewel<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.560> can<00:04:49.830> see<00:04:50.040> there

against the left hand red line and what
that<00:04:55.290> basically<00:04:55.500> does<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.490> eliminates

that basically does is it eliminates

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.290 
that basically does is it eliminates
that<00:04:57.870> number<00:04:58.710> out<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.400> cold<00:04:59.670> altogether

that number out of the cold altogether
so<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.380> can't<00:05:01.620> inadvertently<00:05:02.490> jump<00:05:02.850> around

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
so it can't inadvertently jump around

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.930 
so it can't inadvertently jump around
and<00:05:03.950> inadvertently<00:05:04.950> be<00:05:05.220> part<00:05:05.490> of<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> code

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
and inadvertently be part of the code

and lock yourselves out

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.110

so<00:05:07.680> once<00:05:08.160> you've<00:05:08.310> actually<00:05:08.490> finished<00:05:08.760> putting

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
so once you've actually finished putting

so once you've actually finished putting
the<00:05:09.210> code<00:05:09.450> in<00:05:09.660> three<00:05:09.870> four<00:05:10.110> one<00:05:10.290> six<00:05:10.530> I'm<00:05:10.740> going

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
the code in three four one six I'm going

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.290 
the code in three four one six I'm going
to<00:05:10.950> do<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.160> same<00:05:11.370> as<00:05:11.490> well<00:05:11.670> with<00:05:11.850> number<00:05:12.120> two

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
to do the same as well with number two

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.000 
to do the same as well with number two
because<00:05:12.840> if<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.080> notice<00:05:13.320> there<00:05:13.590> number<00:05:13.890> two

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
because if you notice there number two

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.470 
because if you notice there number two
is<00:05:14.160> just<00:05:14.370> sitting<00:05:14.640> up<00:05:14.700> there<00:05:14.760> quite<00:05:15.120> happily

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
is just sitting up there quite happily

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.200 
is just sitting up there quite happily
well<00:05:16.140> we'll<00:05:16.320> push<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.770> over<00:05:16.980> drop<00:05:17.790> him<00:05:18.000> down

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
well we'll push that over drop him down

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.100 
well we'll push that over drop him down
so<00:05:18.900> he<00:05:18.930> sits<00:05:19.350> there<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:20.430> therefore<00:05:21.390> now<00:05:21.570> he<00:05:21.630> is

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
so he sits there and therefore now he is

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.530 
so he sits there and therefore now he is
now<00:05:22.290> locked<00:05:22.590> out<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.190> code<00:05:23.400> sequence<00:05:23.730> and

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
now locked out of the code sequence and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.170 
now locked out of the code sequence and
we<00:05:24.660> would<00:05:24.810> recommend<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.440> do<00:05:25.710> that

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
we would recommend that you do that

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
we would recommend that you do that
until<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.300> next<00:05:27.330> time<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.930> want<00:05:28.110> to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
until the next time that you want to

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.320 
until the next time that you want to
change<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.560> code<00:05:28.740> okay<00:05:29.490> that's<00:05:29.880> great<00:05:30.060> thank

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
change the code okay that's great thank

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.320 
change the code okay that's great thank
you

the<00:05:36.080> beauty<00:05:36.440> with<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.710> Borg<00:05:36.950> lock<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.550> that

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
the beauty with the Borg lock is that

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.510 
the beauty with the Borg lock is that
you<00:05:38.330> have<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.690> ability<00:05:38.780> to<00:05:39.440> change<00:05:39.980> the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
you have the ability to change the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.940 
you have the ability to change the
length<00:05:40.670> of<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.000> code<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:42.140> your<00:05:42.290> code<00:05:42.530> could<00:05:42.800> be

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
length of the code so your code could be

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.190 
length of the code so your code could be
only<00:05:43.130> one<00:05:43.250> digit<00:05:43.730> or<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.660> can<00:05:44.780> be<00:05:44.900> as<00:05:44.990> much<00:05:45.020> as

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
only one digit or it can be as much as

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.160 
only one digit or it can be as much as
six<00:05:45.620> digits<00:05:46.130> long<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:47.600> little<00:05:47.780> indicator

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
six digits long this little indicator

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.690 
six digits long this little indicator
here<00:05:48.860> this<00:05:49.760> shows<00:05:50.290> how<00:05:51.290> many<00:05:51.560> digits<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:52.460> code

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
here this shows how many digits the code

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.320 
here this shows how many digits the code
is<00:05:52.910> going<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.210> be<00:05:53.860> if<00:05:54.860> this<00:05:55.340> little<00:05:55.580> digit<00:05:56.120> is

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
is going to be if this little digit is

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.720 
is going to be if this little digit is
further<00:05:56.810> right<00:05:57.260> over<00:05:57.560> in<00:05:57.650> this<00:05:57.770> far<00:05:58.070> end<00:05:58.340> over

further right over in this far end over
here<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:59.870> will<00:06:00.260> say<00:06:00.530> that<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:01.280> code<00:06:01.520> would<00:06:01.730> be

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
here it will say that the code would be

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.530 
here it will say that the code would be
one<00:06:02.090> digit<00:06:02.570> long<00:06:02.780> if<00:06:03.530> however<00:06:03.980> this<00:06:04.820> is<00:06:05.090> right

over<00:06:05.780> here<00:06:06.260> then<00:06:07.010> it<00:06:07.190> will<00:06:07.310> say<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:07.760> code

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
over here then it will say that the code

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.720 
over here then it will say that the code
is<00:06:08.030> six<00:06:08.420> digits<00:06:08.870> long<00:06:09.100> we<00:06:10.100> have<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.490> programmed

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
is six digits long we have it programmed

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.720 
is six digits long we have it programmed
