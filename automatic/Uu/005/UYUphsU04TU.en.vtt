is<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.479> week<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.810> think

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is really more like the week I think

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
is really more like the week I think
it's<00:01:25.170> better<00:01:25.290> than<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.530> week<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.490> far<00:01:26.700> as

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it's better than a week but as far as

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
it's better than a week but as far as
how<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> navigate<00:01:27.119> especially<00:01:27.479> using<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
how you navigate especially using the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
how you navigate especially using the
hardware<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.710> PlayStation<00:01:29.159> controller<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
hardware the PlayStation controller it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
hardware the PlayStation controller it's
more<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.540> wii<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> xbox<00:01:31.470> 360

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
more like the wii what the xbox 360

piece of software in the dashboard that
you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can't<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> Kinect

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649

itself<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.860> i'm<00:02:11.099> pretty<00:02:11.129> sure<00:02:11.459> they'll

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
itself which i'm pretty sure they'll

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.910 
itself which i'm pretty sure they'll
probably<00:02:11.819> bring<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.540> defeat

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
probably bring that in defeat

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160 
probably bring that in defeat
hopefully<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:13.849> then<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.420> sucks<00:02:14.690> now<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
hopefully if not then that sucks now the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.930 
hopefully if not then that sucks now the
biggest<00:02:15.650> deciding<00:02:15.980> factor<00:02:16.370> between<00:02:16.520> both<00:02:16.790> of

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
biggest deciding factor between both of

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.979 
biggest deciding factor between both of
these<00:02:17.030> vices<00:02:17.239> probably<00:02:17.720> going<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> be

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
these vices probably going to be

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.780 
these vices probably going to be
software<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.739> games<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.190> that's<00:02:19.610> really

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
software and games for that's really

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.160 
software and games for that's really
going<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.940> decide<00:02:20.209> which<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.050> be

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
going to decide which one is going to be

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.260 
going to decide which one is going to be
the<00:02:21.290> biggest<00:02:21.470> success<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:22.880> far<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the biggest success now as far as the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.089 
the biggest success now as far as the
whole<00:02:23.450> general<00:02:23.870> lineup<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.530> games<00:02:24.739> i<00:02:24.920> think

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
whole general lineup of games i think

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.220 
whole general lineup of games i think
the<00:02:25.160> connect<00:02:25.430> has<00:02:25.640> probably<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.750> 20<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.200> more

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the connect has probably like 20 or more

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.050 
the connect has probably like 20 or more
games<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.950> came<00:02:28.099> out<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> lot

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
games that came out for you have a lot

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.390 
games that came out for you have a lot
of<00:02:29.090> our<00:02:29.390> variety<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.800> kinect<00:02:31.160> games

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
of our variety with the kinect games

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.220 
of our variety with the kinect games
playstation<00:02:31.940> move<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.600> probably<00:02:32.810> had<00:02:33.080> about

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
playstation move you probably had about

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.710 
playstation move you probably had about
six<00:02:33.890> or<00:02:34.010> seven<00:02:34.190> maybe<00:02:34.459> ten<00:02:34.819> our<00:02:35.180> games<00:02:35.569> that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
six or seven maybe ten our games that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.690 
six or seven maybe ten our games that
came<00:02:35.840> out<00:02:36.020> with<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:36.739> overall<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.250> think<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
came out with it but overall I think the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.280 
came out with it but overall I think the
overall<00:02:38.209> reaction<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> game<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.050> came

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
overall reaction to the game that came

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.380 
overall reaction to the game that came
out<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.709> some<00:02:40.010> sucked<00:02:40.340> some<00:02:41.060> are<00:02:41.209> good

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
out with this some sucked some are good

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.210 
out with this some sucked some are good
and<00:02:41.450> some<00:02:41.690> really<00:02:42.110> stood<00:02:42.319> out<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:43.099> it's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and some really stood out I think it's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.949 
and some really stood out I think it's
kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> even<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:43.940> both<00:02:44.150> platforms<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.750> can't

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
kind of even for both platforms I can't

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.870 
kind of even for both platforms I can't
review<00:02:45.140> all<00:02:45.350> those<00:02:45.560> games<00:02:45.800> but<00:02:46.340> he's<00:02:46.489> talking

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
review all those games but he's talking

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.250

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
different than the week which probably

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.440 
different than the week which probably
everybody<00:03:37.070> has<00:03:37.280> already<00:03:37.549> probably<00:03:38.180> going

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
a different dynamic to the games you

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:45.789 
a different dynamic to the games you
really<00:03:45.230> feel<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.440> you're<00:03:45.709> actually

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
really feel like you're actually
