prisoners I ran out I don't know why I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.460 
prisoners I ran out I don't know why I
made<00:00:18.410> this<00:00:18.560> open-ended<00:00:19.070> open<00:00:19.700> beach<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:20.720> I'm

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
made this open-ended open beach and I'm

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.109 
made this open-ended open beach and I'm
thinking<00:00:21.740> about<00:00:21.829> prisons<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.579> I'm<00:00:22.730> stinking

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
thinking about prisons and I'm stinking

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.970 
thinking about prisons and I'm stinking
that<00:00:23.270> I<00:00:23.660> think<00:00:23.869> that<00:00:23.989> if<00:00:24.259> I<00:00:24.349> was<00:00:24.500> open<00:00:24.770> up<00:00:24.860> a

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
that I think that if I was open up a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280 
that I think that if I was open up a
prison<00:00:25.310> built<00:00:25.669> like<00:00:25.910> next<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.329> beach<00:00:26.509> and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
prison built like next to the beach and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.400 
prison built like next to the beach and
like<00:00:27.470> each<00:00:27.739> prison<00:00:28.189> cell<00:00:28.430> would<00:00:28.700> be<00:00:28.820> like<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.410> by

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
like each prison cell would be like a by

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.830 
like each prison cell would be like a by
itself<00:00:30.739> like<00:00:31.369> it's<00:00:31.610> one<00:00:31.910> prison<00:00:32.270> cell<00:00:32.450> like<00:00:32.720> in

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
itself like it's one prison cell like in

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.210 
itself like it's one prison cell like in
the<00:00:32.930> middle<00:00:33.079> of<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.200> ocean<00:00:33.290> not<00:00:33.800> maybe<00:00:34.100> not

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
the middle of the ocean not maybe not

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.979 
the middle of the ocean not maybe not
the<00:00:34.340> ocean<00:00:34.460> or<00:00:35.329> maybe<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.660> could<00:00:35.780> be<00:00:35.840> like

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the ocean or maybe you could be like

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.139 
the ocean or maybe you could be like
underwater<00:00:36.440> like<00:00:36.949> a<00:00:36.980> shark<00:00:37.489> cage<00:00:37.730> like<00:00:38.030> you

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
underwater like a shark cage like you

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.150 
underwater like a shark cage like you
know<00:00:38.269> a<00:00:38.300> shark<00:00:38.690> weak<00:00:38.930> people<00:00:39.170> like<00:00:39.410> serve<00:00:40.010> it

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
know a shark weak people like serve it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.590 
know a shark weak people like serve it
to<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.340> cage<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:40.789> then<00:00:40.879> look<00:00:41.059> at<00:00:41.180> sharks<00:00:41.480> and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
to the cage and then look at sharks and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.779 
to the cage and then look at sharks and
video<00:00:41.809> tape<00:00:42.019> sharks<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:43.219> think<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:43.640> could

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
video tape sharks and I think that could

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.240 
video tape sharks and I think that could
be<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.910> really<00:00:44.149> good<00:00:44.359> room<00:00:45.109> really<00:00:45.769> good<00:00:45.980> cell

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
be a really good room really good cell

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.220 
be a really good room really good cell
for<00:00:46.789> prisoners<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.329> know<00:00:47.449> just<00:00:47.660> right<00:00:48.199> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
for prisoners you know just right a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.079 
for prisoners you know just right a
minute<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> ocean<00:00:48.920> like<00:00:49.039> that<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.429> then

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
minute of the ocean like that and then

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.150 
minute of the ocean like that and then
and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:50.629> like<00:00:50.839> um<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.440> another<00:00:51.649> idea<00:00:52.010> is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
and then like um the another idea is

I think that they did the view you know
that<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> review<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.260> whole<00:02:18.350> world<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
horizon like you know but then like Doug

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.000 
horizon like you know but then like Doug
you<00:02:25.790> trap<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.330> can't<00:02:26.600> move<00:02:26.720> at<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.920> look

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.710 
you trap you can't move at all you look
around<00:02:28.340> maybe<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.610> lose<00:02:28.790> all<00:02:29.120> sense<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.450> space

around maybe you lose all sense of space
and<00:02:29.870> time<00:02:29.930> maybe<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.830> that's<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.220> you

room<00:03:17.570> or<00:03:17.750> something<00:03:17.930> like<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.070> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
room or something like in the the the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.970 
room or something like in the the the
and<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.630> pictures<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.260> rooms<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.680> like

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
and the pictures of the rooms just like

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.910 
and the pictures of the rooms just like
the<00:03:22.850> horizon<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:24.050> sky<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.560> beachy

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
the horizon the sky and the beachy

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.550 
the horizon the sky and the beachy
looking<00:03:25.220> at<00:03:25.340> maybe<00:03:25.640> even<00:03:26.270> it's<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.600> miles

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
looking at maybe even it's like miles

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.080 
looking at maybe even it's like miles
miles<00:03:27.740> away<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.430> Reinhardt<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:28.970> like

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
miles away like it's Reinhardt it's like

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.130 
miles away like it's Reinhardt it's like
a<00:03:29.150> rule<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.540> tracks<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.390> think<00:03:32.690> that's<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
a rule that tracks so I think that's the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.040 
a rule that tracks so I think that's the
best<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.740> worst<00:03:33.770> kind<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.220> cell<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.670> know

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
best and the worst kind of cell you know

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.380 
best and the worst kind of cell you know
to<00:03:36.050> be<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.800> see<00:03:37.070> into<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.430> ocean<00:03:38.240> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
to be in you can see into the ocean the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.900 
to be in you can see into the ocean the
world<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.110> sky<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> limitless<00:03:40.340> sky

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
world in the sky and the limitless sky

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.850 
world in the sky and the limitless sky
but<00:03:41.540> then<00:03:41.690> you're<00:03:41.930> trapped<00:03:42.350> in<00:03:42.740> this<00:03:42.800> little

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
but then you're trapped in this little

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.120 
but then you're trapped in this little
circle<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.610> can't<00:03:43.850> move<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.800> does<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:45.920> make

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
circle you can't move and does that make

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.920 
circle you can't move and does that make
the<00:03:46.340> view<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:47.270> what<00:03:47.450> does<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.630> make<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
the view like what does that make the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.650 
the view like what does that make the
view<00:03:48.170> like<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:49.400> gives<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.700> hope<00:03:49.910> but<00:03:50.240> at<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
view like it gives you hope but at the
