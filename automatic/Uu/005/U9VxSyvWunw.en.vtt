00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.440 
then another on off and the VA our song
and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> plug<00:01:07.950> says<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.640> active<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and then this plug says very active and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.830 
and then this plug says very active and
then<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> AC<00:01:11.549> DC<00:01:12.060> plug<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.130> then<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
then have a AC DC plug and then I have a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.429 
then have a AC DC plug and then I have a
DC<00:01:15.890> AC<00:01:17.000> off<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:20.030> do<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.659> exactly<00:01:21.990> what

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
DC AC off I do not know exactly what

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.880 
DC AC off I do not know exactly what
this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.610> box<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.360> i<00:01:24.890> also

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this is for with this box is for i also

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
this is for with this box is for i also
picked<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:30.110> SS<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.689> put<00:01:34.340> 120<00:01:35.340> volts<00:01:36.020> max

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
picked up this SS and put 120 volts max

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.399 
picked up this SS and put 120 volts max
a<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> says<00:01:40.110> 15<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:43.009> app<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> says

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
a and then it says 15 a app here it says

what that's for but it only has one
extension<00:02:18.200> cord<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.799> had<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.310> tell<00:02:19.580> me<00:02:19.730> what

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
extension cord so had to tell me what

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.420 
extension cord so had to tell me what
boats<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.110> guess<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.530> coming<00:02:21.890> out<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> wall

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
