 When asked to provide data to investigative agencies, 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.110
 The Soul also post notice 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:17.580
 But the process by which a client checks his or her delivery of data is quite complex. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.009
 There may be reasons for everyone , but there are some who think that the legal process 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.460
 It is also pointed out that it is not. 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:28.199
 Let's take a look at Kim Hyun-joo pd. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 Yes, yes. First of all, human rights NGOs are prohibiting CyberSathel. 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.860
 Tell me what it is. Tell me about your investigation. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.120
 I do not want to be able to search for messengers such as KakaoTalk unintentionally. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.920
 It is contents. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.769

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510
 I started 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:05.570
 This is now effective in monitoring the state power, investigative authorities and watchdogs. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 Let's fix the actual situation with the current Communication Privacy Protection Act. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.570
 The fact that personal information is easily provided by the investigating agency 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.950
 That's the part. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:21.620
 On the other hand, it's kind of hard for the parties to know the facts. 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.380
 4 Actually, telcos have disclosed that their personal information was provided to investigators. 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.420
 Ida has ignored the needs of our customers. 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.370
 Since then, it has been illegal for some customers not to disclose their offer , 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.410
 We've been suing him. 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.160

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.960

 That's it. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.680
 In the case of SK Telecom, what about other carriers? 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.239

 4 I've applied for it directly. Let me see what the results are. 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:19.230
 The paper I'm holding is a confirmation letter from sk telecom. 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:23.189
 4 I did not have any communications available to investigators over the past year . 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.310
 I checked the exemption with me. I had one. 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:32.969
 4 If you came to the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office was a part of the screen you see the available facts 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.200
 The Incheon District Prosecutor's Office made a request for skt on June 28 last year 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:39.510
 It's coming out. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.790
 The area marked in black, that is, the name, resident number, phone number, address , 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.829
 It comes out that it was provided. 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:51.620
 If it is confirmed that the personal information is provided to the investigating agency in this way, 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.620
 Some investigators may be asked whether the request 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:01.440
 Yes, without the warrant, but with personal information. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.130
 Four this is illegal is illegal to have provided four yigeonde government official said 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 I have never been contacted, so I have to check with Kim pd . 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.720
 You know . 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.690
 Is there any way I can raise a complaint about this here 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.489
 You can claim damages 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.830
 In October 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that no communication was provided without a warrant. 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:27.360
 I had to pay 500,000 won for the seat of the Supreme Court. 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.630
 There is a ruling, but if you file a claim for damages, you 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.830
 The lawyer's judgment is high. 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.110
 But yes, as given to the above description to confirm the fact that communication Source 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.070
 The process is a little cumbersome. 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.420
 However, it is a violation of the law that this procedure is made cumbersome . 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.240
 He pointed to it. 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:52.970
 4 You violated the Act on the Promotion of Information Network Usage and Information Protection, etc. 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.970
 We will see, listen to the Open Net lawyer Kim Da-hyun 

00:04:53.049 --> 00:05:03.399
 I looked directly at some of the stores that had a specific intestinal visit 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:07.869
 But when you get on a nice collection of personal information that should go anywhere. What is the total 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:09.639
 If a check right a lot of money when you can live younger self when registering online secondary 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:14.709

 Or awful easy home while his mother read that there are provided three priests government 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:31.300
 Is that the leakage problem and use when you want to make sure that these 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:34.619
 The law clearly states that it should be easier . 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.619
 It is difficult now. 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.490
 If you violate this provision, as the lawyers say there's more than just 30 million won fine 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.060
 It's furniture. 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:53.010
 Currently, the Open- minded Permanent Resident Participation Solidarity Association 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:56.570
 The telecommunication committee has requested the broadcasting tonnage for the correctional order imposition fines disposition . 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.570
