00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
what they're doing and they're just

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.100 
what they're doing and they're just
dumping<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.239> water<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.720> there

dumping this water in there
we've<00:02:43.620> got<00:02:43.890> coal<00:02:44.640> ash<00:02:45.080> waste<00:02:46.080> water<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.620> is

we've got coal ash waste water that is

we've got coal ash waste water that is
bright<00:02:47.280> blue<00:02:47.519> we<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.720> licorice<00:02:49.410> smelling

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
bright blue we have licorice smelling

bright blue we have licorice smelling
flammable<00:02:51.120> water<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.840> came<00:02:52.049> as<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> result<00:02:52.500> of

flammable water that came as a result of

fracking<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.660> West<00:02:54.930> Virginia<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
fracking in West Virginia I think that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.400 
fracking in West Virginia I think that
was<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> story<00:02:56.489> from<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.849> month<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.239> two<00:02:57.360> ago

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
was the story from a month or two ago

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.009 
was the story from a month or two ago
this<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.890> incredible<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.660> we

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
this is just incredible and and we we

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.710 
this is just incredible and and we we
don't<00:03:01.319> seem<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:02.430> will<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.790> take<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.120> people

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
don't seem what will it take for people

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.569 
don't seem what will it take for people
to<00:03:03.870> realize<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.799> don't<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.489> be

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
to realize you know we don't have to be

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.759 
to realize you know we don't have to be
dealing<00:03:05.819> with<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.360> type<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.810> energy<00:03:06.930> we

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
dealing with this type of energy we

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.949 
dealing with this type of energy we
could<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.069> completely<00:03:08.579> on<00:03:08.959> alternative

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
could be completely on alternative

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.750 
could be completely on alternative
energy<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.069> just<00:03:11.280> doesn't<00:03:11.579> seem<00:03:11.700> that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
energy and and it just doesn't seem that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.309 
energy and and it just doesn't seem that
there's<00:03:12.209> anything<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.810> will<00:03:12.930> make<00:03:12.959> people

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
there's anything that will make people

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.910 
there's anything that will make people
realize<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:14.269> we<00:03:15.269> could<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.840> could<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
realize this we could we could be but I

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.949 
realize this we could we could be but I
mean<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.579> term<00:03:17.730> too-big-to-fail<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.480> think

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
mean the term too-big-to-fail I think

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.690 
mean the term too-big-to-fail I think
doesn't<00:03:19.139> just<00:03:19.380> apply<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.680> banks<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.340> think<00:03:20.579> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
doesn't just apply to banks I think it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.190 
doesn't just apply to banks I think it
applies<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.000> these<00:03:21.299> energy<00:03:21.660> companies<00:03:21.690> as

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
applies to these energy companies as

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.050 
applies to these energy companies as
well<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.650> mean<00:03:23.130> what<00:03:23.310> are<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.400> gonna<00:03:23.549> do<00:03:23.790> you're

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
well I mean what are you gonna do you're

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.460 
well I mean what are you gonna do you're
gonna<00:03:24.150> shut<00:03:24.420> down<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.750> energy<00:03:25.079> company<00:03:25.440> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
gonna shut down this energy company and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.559 
gonna shut down this energy company and
then<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.859> have<00:03:26.459> all<00:03:26.700> these<00:03:26.850> people<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.389> no

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
then have have all these people have no

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.530 
then have have all these people have no
power<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:29.760> unfortunately

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
power because of that it's unfortunately

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 
power because of that it's unfortunately
something<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.380> keep<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.859> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
something you have to keep up and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.530 
something you have to keep up and
running<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.819> same<00:03:33.030> type<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.269> thing

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
running it's the same type of thing

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.890 
running it's the same type of thing
Louis<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.959> think<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.350> we<00:03:34.440> could<00:03:34.590> apply<00:03:34.799> to

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
Louis I think that we could apply to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.069 
Louis I think that we could apply to
Obamacare's

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
Obamacare's

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.590 
Obamacare's
negative<00:03:37.829> effect<00:03:38.220> when<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.579> comes<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:39.090> you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
negative effect when it comes to you

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.479 
negative effect when it comes to you
give<00:03:39.780> 30<00:03:40.109> million<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.650> customers<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> the
