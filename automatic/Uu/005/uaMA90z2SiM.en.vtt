00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:12.080
 hello friends in this opportunity the channel 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 Professor Green Lopez will guide you as 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.560
 make a puppet with recyclable material 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:23.599
 and invite them to join the campaign 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.509
 of a puppet for a smile which 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:32.349
 it consists of making a puppet and 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.349
 give it to a boy or girl thanks 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 good for the explanation of the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.910
 patterns for puppet making 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.240
 with the pieces of cloth we have the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.520
 need to make a pattern we can 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.830
 do it on cardboard and pass it on paper 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:10.200
 bond the measures of this pattern are in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 the long side of the pattern should measure 30 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.450
 centimeters in width 16 centimeters 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.670
 at the bottom but as you 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.130
 we are going up towards the mouth part 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.259
 We are reducing that we try to make 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 15 centimeters wide this is going to be in 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 located in the fold of the fabric of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 way that when we open it is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.530
 as a kind of heart so that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.500
 have more or less the idea for the part 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.620
 from the mouth 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.290
 then we have this pattern that is the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.530
 internal part of the mouth we place 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.950
 about folding the fabric and having 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 a height of 7 centimeters wide 15 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.170
 centimeters so that it fits in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.170
 this sector of the body of twitter 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.879
 good as you will see then here we have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 made the cut guiding us by the pattern 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:16.970
 where we get this way to be very 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.210
 pending to have the fold of the fabric 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.130
 for the mouth of this sector and for the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.130
 body on this side 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.920
 this is the view of the cut that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.770
 we just made the piece of fabric and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 So it must be staying this is for the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.260
 internal part of the mouth and around here 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.230
 we are going to double to then do the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 seams of how to paste these pieces 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.610
 let's proceed to paste first the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.400
 inner part of the mouth for that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.440
 we put the pattern in this way and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.280
 we put the circle of the mouth 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 In this sector 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.390
 ok it's coming to us then after 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.959
 sewing this puppet base now 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.300
 let's make the ornaments the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 implements the eyes and decoration 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.380
 that we are going to place 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.019
 to make the eyes of the puppets 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.720
 we are going to need the packaging and 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.140
 packages that bring the pills or 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.879
 some trinkets a few grains in this 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.920
 here we have the caraotas here 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:47.420
 that are black and we do the cleaning 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.870
 of the silver part 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 and we use a piece of cardboard 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.719
 White 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.129
 thus achieving these eyes 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.129
 funny then made with recycling 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.540
 to make the puppet's hair we take 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.230
 a plastic bag we cut the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.450
 tips and we make a curtain of 3 strips 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.860
 which we weave as a clinic 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.950
 then later it is 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 recommended to know her at the head of 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.830
 puppet so that it does not go away 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:39.180
 detach we try to make a small 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.180
 pollinica and some moorings at the tips 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.930
 to make puppet accessories in 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.130
 this case the hat we use caps 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.800
 of plastic bottles and with a 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.650
 black cardboard we make the cuts of the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.050
 top of the environment and the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.720
 part of the hat below we stick 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:09.560
 with stick on the bar and good we get this 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.560
 this work 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 good the little hat we have stuck a 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.390
 tie with a little flower is a 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.740
 decoration and as a final ending a 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:28.210
 skirt I made with about 50 centimeters 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.500
 of bright tulle and this good this is the 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.210
 proposal of this puppet that surely 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.600
 it will please the heart of many children 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:45.000
 I hope you like this project and you 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.000
 get excited to do it thank you
