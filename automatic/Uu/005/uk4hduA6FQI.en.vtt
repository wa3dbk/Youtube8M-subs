next slide came out and they were a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.170 
next slide came out and they were a
trainer<00:01:14.880> model<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:16.880> probably<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
trainer model so probably you know the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.530 
trainer model so probably you know the
model<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> saw<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.299> then<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
model that I saw it first and then I was

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
model that I saw it first and then I was
thinking<00:01:24.680> why<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.710> Reebok<00:01:26.310> are<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.610> putting

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
thinking why the Reebok are not putting

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.730 
thinking why the Reebok are not putting
the<00:01:27.360> next<00:01:27.509> five<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> basketball<00:01:28.439> models

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the next five in the basketball models

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.350 
the next five in the basketball models
as<00:01:28.890> well<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> mean<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:29.970> much<00:01:30.090> every

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
as well I mean and pretty much every

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
as well I mean and pretty much every
other<00:01:30.479> sport<00:01:30.890> they<00:01:31.890> should<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.880> hex

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
other sport they should just use hex

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
other sport they should just use hex
light<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.540> forefoot<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.380> team<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.680> well

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
light and forefoot and the team as well

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.300 
light and forefoot and the team as well
what<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> cushioning<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.689> guess

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
what about a cushioning but I guess

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.499 
what about a cushioning but I guess
maybe<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.610> more<00:01:38.850> expensive<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.360> him

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
maybe it was more expensive to him

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.990 
maybe it was more expensive to him
implemented<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.259> both<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> nevertheless

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
implemented on both but nevertheless

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
implemented on both but nevertheless
this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.210> another<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:46.619> classic<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.159> me
