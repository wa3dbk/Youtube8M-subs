00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
things as well so this one definitely

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.810 
things as well so this one definitely
had<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.530> space<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:47.280> but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

had a little bit more space to use but
it's<00:01:47.939> also<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.390> heavier<00:01:49.100> overall<00:01:50.100> than<00:01:50.310> the

it's also a lot heavier overall than the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
it's also a lot heavier overall than the
other<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.240> these<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.509> two<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.869> good

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

leathers<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:55.350> definitely<00:01:55.799> worth

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
leathers and are definitely worth

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
leathers and are definitely worth
checking<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.750> they're<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.990> inexpensive

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
checking out they're not inexpensive

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
checking out they're not inexpensive
these<00:01:59.219> bags<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.759> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.180> heirloom

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bags they're guaranteed for life there I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.149

think<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> ad<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> page<00:02:04.500> says<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> these

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
think the ad on the page says that these

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.850 
think the ad on the page says that these
are<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> bags<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.850> your<00:02:06.710> ancestors<00:02:07.710> will

are the bags that your ancestors will

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.889 
are the bags that your ancestors will
fight<00:02:08.129> over<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.580> things<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> it's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
fight over and things like that and it's

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449
