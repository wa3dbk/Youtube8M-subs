00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.850
 good today we are going to show you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.559
 how to repair a speedometer of a 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.559
 toyota hylux 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.360
 the client says it was not to walk the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.360
 speedometer 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.289
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:29.030
 is to check what 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:32.240
 the speedometer is not cable 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.400
 our cable cops would have to 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.710
 locate the casing that comes out of the speedometer 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.340
 towards the box that surely tele 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 shortened in this case is electronic 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.300
 what does electronic work mean 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.629
 as sensor a box 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.629
 which gives you speed 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.980
 let's do now 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.570
 It is to locate the position of the sensor in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.890
 this one on this occasion is below 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.260
 from the box which I already took it 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.680
 It is true 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.900
 they reached us but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.100
 although we have the file 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.020
 and the sensor was placed in that body 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 what is the problem of sight decrease 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 that is a fact attacking in the field 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.040
 7 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.180
 and we are sent to the connections 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.660
 policy what we are going to do is 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.660
 repair it 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.820
 how is the fact here 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.770
 This is a welding row 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.610
 what we are going to do is so that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 break back 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.080
 we will pay with poxipol 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.670
 to prevent cables from working or the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.670
 welding and breaking 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.759
 another thing that we should verify only by 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.979
 the idea of the cables I accept here 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.830
 we have for example the first of this 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.849
 side is the positive is of the middle is the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.560
 negative and the other moth is the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.560
 signal that the one who sends the signal 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.080
 Asia 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.130
 to be speedometer like we can 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.430
 check only by grabbing a tester 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.950
 in the cables that the truck placed 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.430
 one is the positive one has to give 12 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.410
 balls between this and a mass the other is 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.500
 the neutral 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 and this is to teach if we touch it to 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.530
 marsans in the engine of the truck the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.470
 needle will want to lift and will go down 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.930
 to its normal position if I have already paste 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.500
 prepared the glue so we're going 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.800
 to hit to avoid breaking again 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.880
 very well we have already stuck 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.870
 to avoid feeling again now 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.870
 we will place it 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 and then subtract testing them and once 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.460
 Let 's review the installation cables 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.250
 the truck that has negative positive 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.280
 and sensor 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.069
 that the speedometer goes 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.469
 if those three things are working 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.510
 I would have to keep going like this 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.269
 just give me pause what I'm going to put 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.930
 and we will continue with the good tutorial 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.040
 here we are again we have placed the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.200
 sensor 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.050
 a screw 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.740
 to created this program 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.740
 let's go up 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.439
 do not 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.439
 of the truck 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 the contact 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.720
 to appreciate that he is already 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.900
 and it has already been repaired 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.240
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.300
 as always this is a can be applied 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.230
 in any type of vehicle that is 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.050
 electronic cars trucks is what 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.540
 either the deals have the same sensor or 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.050
 only what needs to be done is this 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.430
 locate the sensor that is placed at the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.430
 box and 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.680
 and do that procedure well many 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.419
 sometimes it happens that the sensor is not 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.580
 our route, that is, there are not 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.370
 cables cut nothing but they are usually 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.639
 break burn and a departure from 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.820
 system 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.060
 it is true this 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.410
 seeing that the wires coming out of the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.780
 installation I have positive or negative 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.250
 of the speedometer sensor if that's 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.470
 all right you connect them and not 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.140
 it works it is very possible that the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.970
 burned sensor that in most of the 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.250
 cases is what happens but from time to time 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.400
 when they have a cablecito with a cable 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.590
 only that you have cut that this one already 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840
 It does not work that well, I hope you 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.560
 has served if you liked the tutorial 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.390
 I like it and subscribe to my video 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.940
 where I go up to my channel where I upload all 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.980
 the tutors of the problems that come 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.880
 to the mind to 7 good I hope you 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.880
 like it until later
