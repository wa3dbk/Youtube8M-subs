00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.490
 yes windows i love you 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.880
 hey with friends goals as they are 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.500
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.270
 minecraft pocket edition guys and in 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.520
 this case what we are going to do is play 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.230
 a map that a subscriber sent me that 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.510
 he put me in the roles guys and I guess 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.670
 it's worth seeing what it's about 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.740
 it's because it's a super parkour and that the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.780
 equis lage means in child garcía 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.000
 go or we already have on the map 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.370
 good guys you do not want to play and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.230
 first of all it would be advisable that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.030
 there was not on the map for you 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.260
 surprise so well so I'm going to 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.880
 leave the link in the description guys 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.790
 so they can play it before me and 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.370
 then say soul because I have seen 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930
 here and it's very easy something with the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 style though guys here we have 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.640
 solution I hope you like it's rules 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.170
 do not break blocks or the survival that you 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 I like you to have a lot of fun 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.910
 primary I'm liking basically 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.410
 because I did me so nice to me 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.360
 about to sneeze the story 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.380
 sneeze and let's go with the map guys ok 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.520
 we are in survival 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.570
 we're 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.830
 we are in creative I did not put it in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.050
 creative 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.480
 so as I found it is better 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.400
 so guys I did not put it in creative 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.050
 and he was already creative so he looks 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.910
 base is going to complicate people in 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.440
 survival good guys I think they are 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.150
 creative play better than that if 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.910
 I fall I will not have a way to go up and 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.860
 you know everything about this show so 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.080
 let's start guys or a little bit 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 parkour oh for god surprised no 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.100
 I think I would have to study because 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.260
 because in the title you want parkour like that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 that was totally unpredictable counting 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.370
 a joke just a quiet joke 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.370
 quiet old there are demons jéróme 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.860
 that he is ok and him although he remembers that 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.200
 whenever you get angry you always start 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.500
 to commit barbarities so either 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.080
 two hurricane winds and here and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 now here and now here or because 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.950
 is going to be your voice in your good place more or 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.770
 less within what fits inside what 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.410
 that is easy for the chef or that around here and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.060
 now we go through here winds guys 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.340
 ok gers one that I just have to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 jump for a lille and pads I have one 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 little that nerve but in law I do not need 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.090
 respawn response only for clouds 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 as the child 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.709
 or I do not think I do not think I do not think that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.599
 it is very easy, in fact it is not so 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.959
 difficult even though there is water here 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.690
 but simple little one or can not 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.410
 be that the bric can not explain or not 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.410
 it may be I will have to jump, then jump 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.790
 by God I never expected it and now 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.069
 I wait in for where they hit leave 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 pattern of smooth halo that here that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 he says it will be a kind of labyrinth or by 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 God guys what I always recommend 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.880
 is to wash then just the right 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.430
 adhesive to travel the entire labyrinth to 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.940
 unless it's a kind of maze of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.650
 be with you out in the middle 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.019
 so that's wrong or it's still here 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.180
 see I said ok now here 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.700
 oh god I think the jump or winds 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.430
 I did not die to low I am well I prove true 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.349
 Hahaha that you gave or not did not fall that well 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.750
 you suffered a lot I'm not well but 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.400
 ubs ok around here is not although they appear 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.920
 it's still the labyrinth so 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.260
 always to the right always to the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.210
 right is the pretty right and I think 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.970

 here there is nothing but in law 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.160

 Mr. Garcia goodbye crime for having me 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.720

 it was very good it was very entertaining 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.220
 to pass the time I think it feels 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.220
 to have 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.350

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.720
 to die more but the truth is that no 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.810
