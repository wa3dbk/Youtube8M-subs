00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
directions and they're going fine your

and typically what happens is you have a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.290 
and typically what happens is you have a
shock<00:02:26.750> or<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.380> strut<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.670> they're

do<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.780> well<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.200> idea<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> chambers<00:03:00.980> is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
do it well the idea of the chambers is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.860 
do it well the idea of the chambers is
to<00:03:01.190> hold<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.550> fluid<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.330> dampen

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
to hold that fluid in there and dampen

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.710 
to hold that fluid in there and dampen
the<00:03:03.350> bounce<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.190> slowly<00:03:04.700> allow<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.570> to

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
the bounce and then slowly allow it to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.890 
the bounce and then slowly allow it to
come<00:03:05.900> back<00:03:06.140> up<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:07.100> when<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.700> shocks<00:03:07.940> bad<00:03:08.270> what

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
come back up now when it shocks bad what

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.240 
come back up now when it shocks bad what
you<00:03:08.930> begin<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.380> see<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> I'll<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.130> with

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you begin to see and I'll do it with

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.729 
you begin to see and I'll do it with
this<00:03:10.280> strut<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.540> begin<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.900> look<00:03:12.500> at<00:03:12.620> that

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
this strut is you begin to look at that

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.320 
this strut is you begin to look at that
is<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.160> gonna<00:03:13.459> hold<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> weight<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.120> car

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
is that gonna hold the weight of the car

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.509 
is that gonna hold the weight of the car
up<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.600> think<00:03:15.080> not<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.739> you're<00:03:15.860> gonna<00:03:16.010> get<00:03:16.250> some

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
up I think not so you're gonna get some

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.120 
up I think not so you're gonna get some
blanking<00:03:17.209> when<00:03:17.390> you're<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:17.660> over<00:03:17.810> bumps<00:03:18.350> if

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
blanking when you're going over bumps if

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.039 
blanking when you're going over bumps if
it's<00:03:19.430> all<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.820> way<00:03:19.940> shot<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:20.930> you

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
it's all the way shot like that if you

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.080 
it's all the way shot like that if you
hear<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.410> sound<00:03:21.470> get<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> shop<00:03:22.519> right<00:03:22.880> away

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
hear that sound get to a shop right away

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.520 
hear that sound get to a shop right away
because<00:03:23.510> you're<00:03:23.630> not<00:03:23.750> just<00:03:23.959> damaged<00:03:24.380> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
because you're not just damaged and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.350 
because you're not just damaged and
tires<00:03:24.709> your<00:03:25.220> damage<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.850> car<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.239> can

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
tires your damage in the car you can

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.930 
tires your damage in the car you can
actually<00:03:26.720> ruin<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.320> vehicles<00:03:27.830> where<00:03:28.820> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
actually ruin the vehicles where the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.490 
actually ruin the vehicles where the
where<00:03:29.180> these<00:03:29.269> mount<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:29.930> tear<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.260> out

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
where these mount you can tear it out

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.259 
where these mount you can tear it out
and<00:03:30.860> end<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.340> having<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.730> some<00:03:31.970> major

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
and end up having to have some major

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.150 
and end up having to have some major
repair<00:03:32.750> done<00:03:32.959> now<00:03:33.320> if<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.470> notice<00:03:33.860> with<00:03:33.980> this

repair done now if you notice with this

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.220 
repair done now if you notice with this
strut<00:03:34.519> it's<00:03:34.670> really<00:03:35.120> hard<00:03:35.600> for<00:03:35.840> me<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.959> push

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
strut it's really hard for me to push

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.570 
strut it's really hard for me to push
down<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.470> putting<00:03:36.799> all<00:03:36.920> my<00:03:36.950> weight<00:03:37.100> into<00:03:37.430> it

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
down and putting all my weight into it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.240 
down and putting all my weight into it
and<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.269> coming<00:03:38.600> up<00:03:38.720> real<00:03:38.989> slow<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.739> that's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
and it's coming up real slow and that's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.220 
and it's coming up real slow and that's
really<00:03:40.519> what<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:40.970> expect<00:03:41.480> from<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.750> shock<00:03:41.989> or<00:03:42.200> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
really what we expect from a shock or a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.020 
really what we expect from a shock or a
strut<00:03:42.590> that's<00:03:42.739> working<00:03:43.190> properly<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.820> should

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
strut that's working properly it should

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.870 
strut that's working properly it should
come<00:03:44.299> up<00:03:44.450> pretty<00:03:44.660> slow<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:46.280> one<00:03:46.459> might<00:03:46.640> be<00:03:46.670> a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
come up pretty slow this one might be a

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910 
come up pretty slow this one might be a
little<00:03:46.940> past<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.200> idea<00:03:48.230> again

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
little past that but the idea again

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.890 
little past that but the idea again
folks<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.970> want<00:03:50.209> your<00:03:50.330> socks<00:03:50.660> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
folks is that you want your socks and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.930 
folks is that you want your socks and
your<00:03:50.959> struts<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.530> be<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.739> great<00:03:52.040> shape<00:03:52.070> taking

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
your struts to be in great shape taking

you<00:03:56.090> can't<00:03:56.420> look<00:03:56.660> at<00:03:56.870> them<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.140> tell

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
you can't look at them and tell

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.320 
you can't look at them and tell
sometimes<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.610> through<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.880> we'll<00:03:59.030> pull<00:03:59.299> a

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
sometimes it's through and we'll pull a

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.640 
sometimes it's through and we'll pull a
little<00:03:59.510> bit<00:03:59.690> when<00:03:59.840> it's<00:03:59.959> off<00:04:00.080> sometimes<00:04:00.530> it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
little bit when it's off sometimes it

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.680 
little bit when it's off sometimes it
won't<00:04:00.739> get<00:04:01.280> an<00:04:01.400> alignment<00:04:01.730> every<00:04:02.150> six<00:04:02.390> months

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
won't get an alignment every six months

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.410 
won't get an alignment every six months
to<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> year<00:04:03.370> certainly<00:04:04.370> have<00:04:04.820> your<00:04:04.970> shocks<00:04:05.209> and

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
to a year certainly have your shocks and

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.210 
to a year certainly have your shocks and
struts<00:04:05.630> checked<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.560> this<00:04:06.860> is<00:04:06.980> another

struts checked and this is another

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.710 
struts checked and this is another
reason<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.640> go<00:04:07.760> see<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> real<00:04:08.030> technician

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
reason to go see a real technician
