for<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> weapon<00:00:27.539> review<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.260> too

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
seriously uh i don't know exactly what
that<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> seems<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.110> funny<00:01:49.439> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that is that seems really funny but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
that is that seems really funny but
apparently<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> person<00:01:50.729> who<00:01:50.880> gives<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> best

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
apparently the person who gives the best

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.530 
apparently the person who gives the best
level<00:01:51.990> design<00:01:52.640> presentation<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:53.759> idea<00:01:54.119> will

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
level design presentation or idea will

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.590 
level design presentation or idea will
then<00:01:54.720> win<00:01:55.320> some<00:01:55.590> signed<00:01:56.119> picture<00:01:57.119> from<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
then win some signed picture from the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780 
then win some signed picture from the
dice<00:01:57.869> dev<00:01:58.170> team<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.040> guess<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.340> kind<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
dice dev team which I guess is kind of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.480 
dice dev team which I guess is kind of
cool<00:01:59.909> if<00:01:59.969> that's<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.770> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
cool if that's what you're into and it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
cool if that's what you're into and it's
no<00:02:02.670> real<00:02:02.969> surprise<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.750> community<00:02:04.170> has

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
no real surprise that the community has

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
no real surprise that the community has
backlashed<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.280> hard<00:02:05.549> against<00:02:05.939> dice<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.360> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
backlashed so hard against dice for this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
backlashed so hard against dice for this
because<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:07.290> lazy<00:02:07.649> that's<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.489> i

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
because it's lazy that's all it is i

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.420 
because it's lazy that's all it is i
mean<00:02:09.000> i<00:02:09.179> thought<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.869> gun<00:02:10.140> camos<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:11.069> pretty

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.110 
mean i thought for gun camos was pretty
darn<00:02:11.670> lazy<00:02:11.879> i<00:02:12.120> mean<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.840> can

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
darn lazy i mean you can

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.080 
darn lazy i mean you can

us for camos for for moderately used

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.680 
us for camos for for moderately used
guns<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:23.049> was<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.650> very<00:02:24.190> cheap<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.849> weird<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
guns it was as very cheap and weird and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.420 
guns it was as very cheap and weird and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
just unlock them and I was thinking like

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.920 
just unlock them and I was thinking like
man<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.579> they<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.030> again<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.480> time<00:02:31.690> I'm

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
man if they do that again this time I'm

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.300 
man if they do that again this time I'm
going<00:02:32.049> to<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:32.620> upset<00:02:32.980> well<00:02:33.159> they

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
going to be really upset well they

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100 
going to be really upset well they
didn't<00:02:33.579> even<00:02:33.760> put<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.360> much<00:02:34.420> effort<00:02:34.629> they

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
didn't even put in that much effort they

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.199 
didn't even put in that much effort they
gave<00:02:35.290> us<00:02:35.409> some<00:02:35.560> crappy<00:02:36.010> art<00:02:36.040> some<00:02:36.790> trailer

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
gave us some crappy art some trailer

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.729 
gave us some crappy art some trailer
that<00:02:37.420> probably<00:02:37.780> didn't<00:02:38.140> make<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.500> cut<00:02:38.680> for

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
that probably didn't make the cut for

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.890 
that probably didn't make the cut for
the<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.519> official<00:02:39.940> trailer<00:02:40.120> release<00:02:40.629> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
then we get to give them our ideas which

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.080 
then we get to give them our ideas which
maybe<00:02:44.110> they'll<00:02:44.409> turn<00:02:44.620> into<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> leveler<00:02:45.459> or<00:02:45.700> not

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
maybe they'll turn into a leveler or not

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.229 
maybe they'll turn into a leveler or not
but<00:02:46.780> anyway<00:02:47.410> dice<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.280> guys<00:02:48.489> deserve<00:02:48.879> the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.589 
thing is is dice did tell us about
content<00:03:09.519> drops<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.000> they<00:03:10.060> made<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.390> seem

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
content drops and they made it seem

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.479 
content drops and they made it seem
pretty<00:03:10.840> cool<00:03:11.079> like<00:03:11.409> perhaps<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.280> would<00:03:12.459> be

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
pretty cool like perhaps it would be

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.539 
pretty cool like perhaps it would be
more<00:03:12.879> weapons<00:03:13.810> or<00:03:14.049> cool<00:03:14.440> weapon<00:03:14.890> unlocks<00:03:15.310> and
