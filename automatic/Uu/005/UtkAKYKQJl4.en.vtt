00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
of trouble and I wasn't really sure what

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.260 
of trouble and I wasn't really sure what
I<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.039> doing<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.910> am<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.029> supposed

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I was doing I was like how am I supposed

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
I was doing I was like how am I supposed
to<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.859> bottle<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.699> only<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:22.430> book

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
to and do the bottle with only the book

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.480 
to and do the bottle with only the book
of<00:00:23.519> lava<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> bit<00:00:25.199> confused<00:00:25.740> but

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of lava and so I was a bit confused but

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
of lava and so I was a bit confused but
I<00:00:26.609> looked<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.900> claiming

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
I looked it up and so I'm not claiming

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
I looked it up and so I'm not claiming
this<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:31.910> method<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.120> doing<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.480> myself

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this like a method of doing it myself

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
this like a method of doing it myself
this<00:00:34.230> isn't<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.739> isn't<00:00:34.920> mine<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> did<00:00:35.309> look<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this isn't this isn't mine I did look it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.270 
this isn't this isn't mine I did look it
up<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.210> thought<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.500> might<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:37.950> well<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
up but I thought I might as well do it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
up but I thought I might as well do it
if<00:00:38.489> someone<00:00:38.760> else<00:00:38.969> wants<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
if someone else wants to see because I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
if someone else wants to see because I
didn't<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.860> many<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.629> are

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
my hotbar and down at the bottom as the

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.630 
my hotbar and down at the bottom as the
the<00:00:52.199> amount<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> stuff<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.250> sort<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the amount of stuff that you sort of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
the amount of stuff that you sort of
have<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.870> cobblestone<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
might have flowed small if spent the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
might have flowed small if spent the
time<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.050> yeah<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.920> basically<00:00:59.399> i<00:00:59.850> need<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.300> do

bit clumsy like I am and so yeah and
that<00:01:49.979> Oh<00:01:50.130> dear<00:01:50.610> me<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> setup<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that Oh dear me that's just a setup that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.969 
that Oh dear me that's just a setup that
you<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.420> after<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> while<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.799> see

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you need and then after a while you see

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.810 
you need and then after a while you see
to<00:01:56.009> wait<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
to wait a little bit and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.969 
to wait a little bit and
the<00:01:59.510> lava<00:01:59.900> I'm<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.320> entirely<00:02:00.530> sure<00:02:00.620> how<00:02:00.890> it

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
the lava I'm not entirely sure how it

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.480 
the lava I'm not entirely sure how it
works<00:02:01.130> because<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.760> wood<00:02:03.130> doesn't<00:02:04.130> set<00:02:04.400> on

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
works because the wood doesn't set on

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.610 
works because the wood doesn't set on
fire<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.510> does<00:02:05.659> set<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:05.930> fire<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:06.320> put<00:02:06.530> it

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
fire if it does set on fire just put it

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.440 
fire if it does set on fire just put it
