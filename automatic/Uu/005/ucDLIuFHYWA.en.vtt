00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
it's nice little extra so there's that

nothing<00:06:57.680> really<00:06:57.770> big<00:06:58.070> here<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.340> think<00:06:58.580> that

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
nothing really big here I think that

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.130 
nothing really big here I think that
they<00:06:58.820> didn't<00:06:59.000> put<00:06:59.150> too<00:06:59.330> much<00:06:59.480> focus<00:06:59.720> on<00:07:00.080> the

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 
they didn't put too much focus on the

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.070 
they didn't put too much focus on the
bulk<00:07:01.100> as<00:07:01.340> they<00:07:01.610> did<00:07:01.880> in<00:07:02.060> the<00:07:02.330> artwork<00:07:02.720> still<00:07:03.020> in

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
bulk as they did in the artwork still in

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.390 
bulk as they did in the artwork still in
pretty<00:07:03.260> sure<00:07:03.410> the<00:07:03.440> artwork<00:07:03.830> is<00:07:03.920> really<00:07:04.220> for

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
pretty sure the artwork is really for

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.369 
pretty sure the artwork is really for
mercy

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379 
mercy

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:09.339
