 Today we are in Minsk about shopping

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.610
 thousand years they all went through the site 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.649
 and looked at the target event 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.759
 the audience was at least 2 times bigger 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.180
 than last year well 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.039

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.259
 announced itself morning by simple 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.420
 reason dota 2 was in tournament 1 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.310
 discipline even handing out sneakers 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 power engineering and electronics not collected 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.079
 as many people as the battle of local power 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.090
 rangers with ukrainian line-up navi 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.100
 the first though desperately resisted but 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.140
 still lost than very upset 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.000
 countrymen next began fighting in 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.110
 counter-strike shadow company 2 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.340

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.500
 years and tanks in it for two years 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.659
 Minsk for the second time already taking tanks and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.179

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.280
 other games great audience cool 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.349
 the mood is a lot of people at the very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.780
 In fact, we can say that is not enough 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.700
 places the air conditioner tries trying 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.470
 somehow puffing doesn't work that is everything 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.099
 still not quite dying of heat 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.269
 here why not on the street but where are we 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.280
 can accommodate such a huge 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.350
 the number of people is all the more small 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:28.030
 think what 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:29.110

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.410
 business of Belarus already love more than 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.480
 T-shirt but above all this is due to 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.640
 so that we play football worse than 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.410
 computer games if our team 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.050
 played like brazil teams think 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.600
 about would be on a par 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.370

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.160

 We gathered right before the tournament 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.260

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.870
 must make an effort 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.690
 starcraft 2 passed demonstrative fights 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.550

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.370

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.000
 quota for summer dreamhack somewhere above 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.070
 the Minsk sun went down squirrels were dying from 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.940
 hunger and somewhere in front of the stage in a sweat 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.430
 persons worked 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.530
 overclocking master screwdrivers which 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.410
