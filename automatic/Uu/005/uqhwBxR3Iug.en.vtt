00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
of the swarm they encounter too many

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
of the swarm they encounter too many
enemies<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:40.140> kept<00:01:40.350> swarming

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
enemies at once and they kept swarming

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
enemies at once and they kept swarming
them<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.280> after<00:01:41.490> another<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.750> kept

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
them one after another and it kept

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
them one after another and it kept
wearing<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.670> until

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
wearing them down one by one until

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
eventually they could not fight back and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
eventually they could not fight back and
that's<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.340> episode<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's kind of what this episode was it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
that's kind of what this episode was it
reminds<00:01:48.840> me<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> how<00:01:49.380> RPGs<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.610> like

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
reminds me of how RPGs really are like

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
reminds me of how RPGs really are like
when<00:01:50.970> you're<00:01:51.090> running<00:01:51.329> low<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.720> let's<00:01:52.229> say

when you're running low on let's say

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.190 
when you're running low on let's say

what<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.100> episode<00:02:02.549> reminded<00:02:02.909> me<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.030> when

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
what this episode reminded me of when

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.880 
what this episode reminded me of when
you<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:03.689> those<00:02:03.840> type<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> situations

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you get into those type of situations

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
you get into those type of situations
you<00:02:05.130> need<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> fuck<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.850> run<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.840> need

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you need to fuck and run you really need

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.089 
you need to fuck and run you really need
to<00:02:07.079> run<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.829> you're<00:02:07.950> gonna

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to run because if you do you're gonna

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
to run because if you do you're gonna
lose<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.670> shit<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
lose a lot of shit and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
lose a lot of shit and
essence<00:02:10.679> since<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.340> isn't<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.970> game

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
essence since this isn't really a game

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.050 
essence since this isn't really a game
to<00:02:12.720> them<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.380> die<00:02:13.620> they<00:02:14.040> die<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.819> good

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
to them if they die they die for good

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.809 
to them if they die they die for good
it's<00:02:16.050> pretty<00:02:16.290> fucking<00:02:16.709> bad<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.459> reminded

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
it's pretty fucking bad so it reminded

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.430 
it's pretty fucking bad so it reminded
me<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.940> lot<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.270> situations<00:02:18.959> I've<00:02:19.110> seen<00:02:19.290> from

couple<00:04:37.910> episodes<00:04:38.000> back<00:04:38.510> when<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.960> Minotaur

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
couple episodes back when the Minotaur

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.290 
couple episodes back when the Minotaur
fight<00:04:39.710> would<00:04:39.980> bail<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.580> he<00:04:40.820> went<00:04:41.030> just

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
fight would bail and he went just

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.650 
fight would bail and he went just
fucking<00:04:42.290> destroying<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.890> Minotaur<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.660> was

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
fucking destroying that Minotaur I was

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.480 
fucking destroying that Minotaur I was
told<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.020> we<00:04:45.260> should<00:04:45.440> expect<00:04:45.680> one<00:04:45.980> more<00:04:46.160> epic

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
told that we should expect one more epic

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.940 
told that we should expect one more epic
fight<00:04:46.730> so<00:04:47.180> I'm<00:04:47.360> assuming<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:48.110> epic<00:04:48.530> fight<00:04:48.740> is

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
fight so I'm assuming that epic fight is

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.520 
fight so I'm assuming that epic fight is
going<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.250> be<00:04:49.370> Goliath<00:04:49.700> I'm<00:04:50.240> assuming<00:04:51.170> I<00:04:51.290> don't

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
going to be Goliath I'm assuming I don't

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.710 
going to be Goliath I'm assuming I don't
know<00:04:51.950> I'm<00:04:52.310> assuming<00:04:52.490> that's<00:04:53.030> what's<00:04:53.270> gonna<00:04:53.450> be

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
know I'm assuming that's what's gonna be

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.510 
know I'm assuming that's what's gonna be
if<00:04:54.140> it<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.350> I'm<00:04:54.710> looking<00:04:54.830> forward<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.430> I'm

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
if it is I'm looking forward to it I'm

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.040 
if it is I'm looking forward to it I'm
wondering<00:04:55.640> exactly<00:04:55.940> what<00:04:56.240> Goliath<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:56.870> really

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
wondering exactly what Goliath is really

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.440 
wondering exactly what Goliath is really
gonna<00:04:57.140> look<00:04:57.380> like<00:04:57.620> I'm<00:04:57.890> guessing<00:04:58.490> gly<00:04:59.180> fizz

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
gonna look like I'm guessing gly fizz

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.960 
gonna look like I'm guessing gly fizz
gonna<00:04:59.630> mirror<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.320> area<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.550> floor<00:05:01.790> is

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
gonna mirror the area that the floor is

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.490 
gonna mirror the area that the floor is
on<00:05:02.120> like<00:05:02.450> probably<00:05:02.690> gonna<00:05:02.900> be<00:05:03.050> something<00:05:03.320> very

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
on like probably gonna be something very

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.470 
on like probably gonna be something very
similar<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.310> creatures<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:04.820> is<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.360> the

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
similar to the creatures that is on the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.910 
similar to the creatures that is on the
floor<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.020> bell<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.500> everybody<00:05:06.740> is

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
floor that bell and everybody is

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.300 
floor that bell and everybody is
fighting<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:08.420> guess<00:05:09.230> a<00:05:09.260> cyclops<00:05:09.770> I'm

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
fighting so I guess a cyclops I'm

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.790 
fighting so I guess a cyclops I'm
assuming<00:05:10.790> some<00:05:10.940> form<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.180> Cyclops<00:05:11.570> or<00:05:11.960> ogre<00:05:12.650> or

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
assuming some form of Cyclops or ogre or

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.930 
assuming some form of Cyclops or ogre or
something<00:05:13.130> that's<00:05:13.250> what<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.430> think<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.820> when<00:05:13.850> I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
something that's what I think of when I

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.210 
something that's what I think of when I
think<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.210> Goliath<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.110> we'll<00:05:15.890> have<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.160> see

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220

could easily rank up adventurers like
nothing<00:06:11.000> instantly<00:06:11.660> if<00:06:11.840> they<00:06:12.260> did<00:06:12.500> sneak<00:06:12.800> in

nothing instantly if they did sneak in
and<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.340> would<00:06:13.430> kind<00:06:13.520> of<00:06:13.640> bend<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.180> rules<00:06:14.390> and

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690
