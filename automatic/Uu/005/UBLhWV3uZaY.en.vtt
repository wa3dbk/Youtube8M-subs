00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello all welcome today 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.020
 I will be showing you how I made my 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.609
 makeup with several products of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 e-mail that I know that many of you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.099
 they also like this line of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 makeup and then I will be 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.759
 using them so that you too 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.770
 can recreate look and as always is 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.710
 my husband and the girl in bed is very 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.050
 early let's go out to eat this day 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 it was a Sunday then I was 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.739
 getting ready to go out to eat with me 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.170
 family only I will be them 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.960
 talking in bits that I think is 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.120
 necessary and therefore first start 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.950
 with this first day market so that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 last more of the makeup I'm also going to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 be accompanying him with a base of mary 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 kate this is the old version but 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.309
 they still have it in the catalogs by 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.809
 in truth I really like this more 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.870
 version that the other one and I'm applying it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.660
 with a clean and angular brush 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.570
 girls if we want our skin 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 look prettier we have to use 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.969
 the clean brushes that our base 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.840
 this one is applied better clean brushes is 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.840
 very important 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.250
 for my daughters, boys, I'm 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.170
 using mary kate's gel and the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.750
 I really liked it, you leave it super 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 super accommodated well hard and I like 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.890
 to seal my makeup I will use 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.500
 this powder and also and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.440
 applying it especially to seal the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.960
 corrector that I was applying and in everything 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.390
 the face what remains on my brush 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.220
 I'm going to use a primer for shadows 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.980
 that I will be using in my eyes this 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.990
 I'm going to apply them both in the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.180
 Eyelid as a little eyelash 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.760
 also because also there I will apply 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.040
 a little bit of color using this browser 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
 from mary kate that I like very much but 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.020
 how to use it separately was the first 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.790
 Once I was using it, it's good 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.660
 many brillitos then do not want to use 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 too 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.270
 now for the eyes I'm going to use this 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.460
 palette that is from Milan and is for 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.070
 eyebrows but I'm going to be using it as 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.260
 eye shadows and color the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.270
 highlight the most clarito I'm going to use 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.430
 on the eyelid and on the little bone of 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.290
 eyebrows also to give color to give 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.110
 depth I will use the most 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.460
 clarito the coffee more clearly and 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.460
 only in the basin 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.360
 in the image 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 two 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.470
 for my first time using the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.350
 merkel gel eyeliner and I liked it 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.570
 I loved this several girls had me 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.459
 said that it was very very good this 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.970
 eyeliner and finally the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.790
 opportunity to use it this is 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.560
 super black pigment very fast dry tea 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.480
 hard is wonderful it is also very 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.980
 well I recommend it 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.020
 here I am in fast camera of 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.660
 Applying me in the other eye, they see that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.320
 It takes a long time to become the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.320
 eyeliner 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.050
 then something very important is to clean 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.479
 the lakers with a washcloth so they do not 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.240
 be there the makeup now with a 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.639
 soft rhythm eyeliner pencil I'm going to 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.259
 be this outlining my lips and of 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.259
 there I will blur it with my finger 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.280
 I want the color to be very strong 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.280
 only a little bit remains 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.200
 a day 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.930
 and now many is with hair like 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.180
 I had told them I had just bathed and 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.880
 I also wash my hair and I go to 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.120
 apply this oil in media to 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.280
 tips rather 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.650
 and what remains is what I'm going to spread 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.169
 all the hair after using this 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.050
 Garnier cream I applied quite 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.270
 It always happens to me that I take out others until the 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.310

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.169
 it sponges me and they mark me well 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.540
 curls I do not use mousse on occasion 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.370

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.449
