the your hero plugs into it you're going
to<00:00:44.309> push<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.910> button<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to push this button and this is going to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
to push this button and this is going to
light<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:48.660> we're

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
light up right here and what we're

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
light up right here and what we're
looking<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.680> you're<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> hold<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
looking for is you're going to hold that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
looking for is you're going to hold that
button<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> confusion<00:00:53.399> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
button down and I think the confusion is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
button down and I think the confusion is
is<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> takes<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.809> time<00:00:55.050> here

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
is it takes a little bit of time here

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
is it takes a little bit of time here
and<00:00:55.649> sometimes<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.219> better<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.640> listen<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and sometimes it's better to listen to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
and sometimes it's better to listen to
it<00:00:57.420> while<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.989> doing<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:59.579> gonna

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.310 
it while you're doing it so you're gonna
push<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> button<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.020> hear

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
