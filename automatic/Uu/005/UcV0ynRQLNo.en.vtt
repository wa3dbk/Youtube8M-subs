Minecraft<00:00:53.670> PC<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.390> didn't<00:00:54.629> come<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
Minecraft PC it didn't come out for a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.529 
Minecraft PC it didn't come out for a
long<00:00:55.170> time<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:57.180> that'll<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
long time so I don't think that'll have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
long time so I don't think that'll have
problem<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> also<00:00:58.410> few<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
problem with that and also few of you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
problem with that and also few of you
were<00:00:59.879> worried<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.109> mob<00:01:01.350> spawning

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
were worried about this the mob spawning

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039 
were worried about this the mob spawning
where<00:01:02.010> he<00:01:02.190> made<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.840> spawn

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
where he made it so they don't spawn

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.190 
where he made it so they don't spawn
indoors<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.830> only<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.150> only<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
indoors is only if it's only if it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
indoors is only if it's only if it's
light<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> glitch<00:01:08.400> where

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
light because there's a glitch where

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.859 
light because there's a glitch where
they'd<00:01:08.729> spawn<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> doors<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> was

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
they'd spawn of doors even if it was

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.950 
they'd spawn of doors even if it was
light<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:11.010> fixed<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.659> won't

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
light so he fixed that or that won't

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380 
light so he fixed that or that won't
