00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
mid-range device one of their entry

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.810 
mid-range device one of their entry
level<00:00:47.579> /<00:00:47.670> mid-range<00:00:48.270> device<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.840> 2014<00:00:49.829> earlier

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
level / mid-range device of 2014 earlier

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
level / mid-range device of 2014 earlier
this<00:00:50.940> year<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.570> release<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.140> sony

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this year they did release the sony

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
this year they did release the sony
xperia<00:00:52.980> e1<00:00:53.180> which<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.600> entry-level

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
xperia e1 which was an entry-level

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.450 
xperia e1 which was an entry-level
device<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.739> i'm<00:00:55.800> guessing<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
device so i'm guessing this is the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
device so i'm guessing this is the
upgraded<00:00:56.760> version<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
upgraded version to that so this one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.220 
upgraded version to that so this one
features<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.190> powerful<00:00:59.820> processor

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
features a more powerful processor

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.200 
features a more powerful processor
slightly<00:01:01.230> better<00:01:01.410> camera<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.489> takes<00:01:02.879> more

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
slightly better camera and it takes more

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
slightly better camera and it takes more
micro<00:01:03.930> SD<00:01:04.229> card<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> terms<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> storage<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
micro SD card in terms of the storage so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
micro SD card in terms of the storage so
go<00:01:05.909> ahead<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.150> actually<00:01:06.420> open<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> box<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
go ahead and actually open the box and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
go ahead and actually open the box and
take<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> look<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.850> these<00:01:09.090> standard

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
take a look so we get all these standard

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
take a look so we get all these standard
stuff<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> box<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.490> free<00:01:11.820> pin

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
stuff in the box we get the free pin

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.810 
stuff in the box we get the free pin
wall<00:01:12.270> adapter<00:01:12.750> marker<00:01:13.200> USB<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> USB<00:01:13.979> wire<00:01:14.549> and

wall adapter marker USB to USB wire and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.850 
wall adapter marker USB to USB wire and
no<00:01:15.330> headphone<00:01:15.780> sony<00:01:16.259> does<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.590> include

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
no headphone sony does not include

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
no headphone sony does not include
headphones<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:17.880> mid<00:01:18.509> range<00:01:18.780> or

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
headphones in their mid range or

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
headphones in their mid range or
entry-level<00:01:19.590> devices<00:01:20.340> box<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.030> ahead

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
entry-level devices box so we go ahead

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
entry-level devices box so we go ahead
and<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> handset

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and actually take a look at the handset

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
and actually take a look at the handset
so<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> answer<00:01:23.909> itself<00:01:24.390> weighs<00:01:25.310> 140<00:01:26.310> free

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
so the answer itself weighs 140 free

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
so the answer itself weighs 140 free
grams<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> 8.5<00:01:28.560> millimeters<00:01:29.159> thick<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
grams and it is 8.5 millimeters thick so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.210 
grams and it is 8.5 millimeters thick so
in<00:01:30.420> terms<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> thickness<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
in terms of the thickness is not that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.300 
in terms of the thickness is not that
thick<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.240> slim<00:01:33.990> um<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
thick is actually very slim um here it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.080 
thick is actually very slim um here it
is<00:01:35.400> compared<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> Sony<00:01:36.689> Xperia<00:01:37.070> SP<00:01:38.090> their

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
is compared to the Sony Xperia SP their

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.020 
is compared to the Sony Xperia SP their
best<00:01:39.770> mid-range<00:01:40.770> device<00:01:41.189> I'll<00:01:41.579> say<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:41.850> have

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
best mid-range device I'll say they have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.870 
best mid-range device I'll say they have
ever<00:01:42.240> created<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:43.500> terms<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> fitness<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ever created in terms of the fitness the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.660 
ever created in terms of the fitness the
SP<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.720> thicker<00:01:46.049> than<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> mp3<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> you

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.260 
polycarbonate back so as you guys can
see<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.709> design<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.340> pretty<00:02:10.640> much<00:02:10.849> it's

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
decent it's not bad I'm is pretty decent

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.910 
decent it's not bad I'm is pretty decent
you<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.360> five<00:02:14.660> min<00:02:14.840> epistle<00:02:15.319> sense<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
you got five min epistle sense with the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.949 
you got five min epistle sense with the
LED<00:02:16.790> flash<00:02:17.090> there<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> back<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.870> a

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
LED flash there at the back in a

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.320 
LED flash there at the back in a
microphone<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.680> also<00:02:18.800> has<00:02:18.950> NFC<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.150> that's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
microphone and it also has NFC so that's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.960 
microphone and it also has NFC so that's
all<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> good<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.160> terms<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
all is good to have but in terms of the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.850 
all is good to have but in terms of the
design<00:02:23.300> aspect<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.989> think<00:02:24.019> Sony<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.769> have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
design aspect I think Sony could have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180 
design aspect I think Sony could have
done<00:02:25.040> more<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.519> back<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.980> removable<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.069> you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
done more the back is removable but you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.339 
done more the back is removable but you
can't<00:02:28.459> take<00:02:28.670> out<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> battery<00:02:29.180> again<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:30.200> can

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
can't take out the battery again you can

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.740 
can't take out the battery again you can
only<00:02:30.500> add<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> micro<00:02:31.190> SD<00:02:31.250> card<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.209> 32

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
only add a micro SD card up to you 32

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.020 
only add a micro SD card up to you 32
gig<00:02:33.019> any<00:02:33.230> micro<00:02:33.769> sim<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.220> think<00:02:34.700> they<00:02:34.819> need<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
gig any micro sim I think they need to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.840 
gig any micro sim I think they need to
start<00:02:35.420> making<00:02:35.660> handsets<00:02:36.319> which<00:02:36.500> arm<00:02:37.069> allow

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
start making handsets which arm allow

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.490 
start making handsets which arm allow
you<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.180> take<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> battery<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> think<00:02:39.260> that'll

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
you to take the battery I think that'll

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.620 
you to take the battery I think that'll
be<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> good<00:02:39.950> selling<00:02:40.340> point<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.700> them<00:02:40.940> but<00:02:41.569> as

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
be a good selling point for them but as

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.690 
be a good selling point for them but as
I<00:02:41.750> said<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.140> terms<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.769> design<00:02:42.980> aspect<00:02:43.610> is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I said in terms of the design aspect is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.180 
I said in terms of the design aspect is
okay<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.660> not<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.110> best<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
okay it's not the best and it's not the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.289 
okay it's not the best and it's not the
worst<00:02:46.370> i<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.720> sony<00:02:48.140> xperia<00:02:48.950> SP

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
worst i think that the sony xperia SP

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.690 
worst i think that the sony xperia SP
was<00:02:50.299> their<00:02:50.569> best<00:02:51.069> design<00:02:52.069> mid-range

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700

was their best design mid-range
smartphone<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.440> i<00:02:54.560> think<00:02:54.769> this<00:02:54.890> one<00:02:55.130> will<00:02:55.250> be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
smartphone and i think this one will be

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.729 
smartphone and i think this one will be
behind<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.299> terms<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.810> beer<00:02:57.080> design<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.709> i

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
behind it in terms of beer design as i
