00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.030
 we saw it at eicma the new one 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.400
 version of the super technology 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.830
 head crossover names of the two caponord 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.779
 1200 rally perfect representative of the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.970
 ideal global motion for mobility 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.800
 daily as for fun and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.869
 travel tourism 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400
 after the cape bite me the 2 April launches 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.960
 this new version to the rally 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 go beyond the boundaries delimited 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.350
 in the asphalt to use the app after the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.350
 journey becomes adventure 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.680
 a bike born of skills 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 April techniques back from double 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.810
 title won in the world championship 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.160
 superbike in the last season caponord 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.310
 rally is clear look at those who are 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.300
 the best competitors on the market with a 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.550
 interpretation of the adventure theme that is 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.980
 April's own opened to not betray 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.040
 what your sporting DNA is 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.970
 we wanted to pass it on to this one 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.280
 motion 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.030
 the whole package we are in 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.330
 able to offer is a bike that allows 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 to the pilot to undertake the journeys in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.790
 absolute comfort and with a budget of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.729
 absolutely complete series but which 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.070
 maintains a character and also an appearance 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.110
 of an absolutely aggressive design e 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
 sports therefore the proportions of the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.910
 vehicle not only bloated but remains 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
 compact and aggressive and also from the point 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.729
 view of dynamic non-behavior 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.500
 betrays those who are the origins 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.660
 aprilia sports related to the many 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.289
 successes that have characterized us in 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.289
 racing world 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.009
 the names of North Cape and Rally are 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.749
 evocative for aprilia the first was 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.519
 introduced in 2001 for what it was 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.400
 the forefather of a new concept 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.599
 evolved from road enduro and rally is from 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.549
 always associated with more models 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.930
 adventurous and off-roaders of the 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.580
 noale house 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.379
 the result is a bike from the chassis 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.190
 exceptional and a technological package 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.239
 at the top 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.580
 a bike that is always pleasant and fun 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.890
 caponord rally is at the top of the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.870
 head family norms the two with one 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.640
 standard equipment ae standard 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.340
 functional and complete represents 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.610
 body and body protections 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.040
 engine a windshield increased by the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.010
 aluminum saddlebags but 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.190
 especially the new spoke wheels with 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.109
 the 19-inch front wheel 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.200
 this equipment clearly expands the 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.290
 concept of perfect travel companion 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.049
 cannes typical of the northern head family 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.799
 allowing the pilot to undertake 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.470
 new roads also off-road 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.180
 then 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.520
 what we wanted to offer with 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.270
 this rally version is a perfect one 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.780
 travel companion that much more 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.360
 versatile and that allows the user to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.550
 appreciate the exceptional driving skills 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.150
 and dynamics that were already proper of the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.480
 corrupt version 17 also on routes 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.910
 not asphalted the technical equipment of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.930
 series also includes a package 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.490
 electronic of the highest level 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.980
 prerogative is the control system 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.070
 electronic of the suspensions to the vigilant 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.270
 a system that has four patents 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.700
 exclusive products launched on the component side 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.490
 and sensors both on the strategy side of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.130
 software control and which allow the 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.200
 pilot to benefit from all those 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.740
 advantages that are typical of systems in 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.250
 electronic control without having to act 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.180
 directly on the settings of the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.360
 suspensions 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.750
 the system of god is in fact capable of 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.820
 understand perfectly what they are 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.830
 condition of the road you are on 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.979
 driving through the installed sensors 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.560
 in the bike and also to understand what they are 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.260
 the dynamic conditions in which one is 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.419
 find the vehicle because it is connected to 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.340
 pilot actions via sensors 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.030
 placed on the braking system e 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.770
 accelerator 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.220
 in this way the bike is capable of 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.200
 adapt behavior and structure 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.229
 of the chassis to accommodate the 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.460
 pilot in any driving condition 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.740
 always ensuring maximum comfort and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.770
 the maximum dynamic performance from 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.979
 part of the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.979
 with caponord rally we also wanted 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.169
 introduce a new compensator a 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.720
 restaurateur on the discharge line that 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.550
 allows an improvement 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.490
 of the supply of the couple above all 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.330
 at low and medium rotation speeds 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.150
 this to better accommodate the 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.620
 character of the engine to a use 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.169
 even in off-road with a delivery 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.870
 more full - bodied is especially fluid a 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.520
 starting from the low and medium regimes of 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.080
 rotation of power and values 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.449
 maximum torque remained 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.250
 absolutely unaffected what 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.340
 has earned a great deal and pleasure of 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.340
 to live
