00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
really wanted this idea of a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and so when a lot of the visual

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.380 
and so when a lot of the visual
development<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.210> Chris

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
development that people like Chris

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.850 
development that people like Chris
Brennan<00:00:39.720> put<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.500> idea<00:00:40.769> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
Brennan put into it was that idea of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.320 
Brennan put into it was that idea of
what<00:00:41.340> happens<00:00:41.699> when<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> take<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> creature

and<00:00:42.600> push<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.900> subterranean<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> long

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and push it subterranean for a long

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.890 
and push it subterranean for a long
period<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.220> time<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.699> so<00:00:45.150> that<00:00:45.180> led<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
period of time and so that led to the

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780 
period of time and so that led to the
sort<00:00:46.080> of<00:00:46.140> albino<00:00:46.440> skin<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.309> idea<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
look like dry earth sort of cracking on

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
look like dry earth sort of cracking on
the<00:01:41.520> paint<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:42.030> even<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.410> things<00:01:43.500> like

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the paint so even for for things like

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.190 
the paint so even for for things like
leather<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.039> metal<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:45.030> created<00:01:45.450> standards

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
leather and metal we created standards

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.199 
leather and metal we created standards
so<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.619> had<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:47.009> specific<00:01:47.610> set<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.849> metal<00:01:48.090> at

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
so we had one specific set of metal at

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.449 
so we had one specific set of metal at
one<00:01:48.360> specific<00:01:48.709> leather<00:01:49.709> texture<00:01:50.069> and<00:01:50.250> skin

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
one specific leather texture and skin

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:51.740 
one specific leather texture and skin
texture<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.849> we<00:01:50.970> could<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.149> share<00:01:51.479> across

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
texture that we could then share across

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.900 
texture that we could then share across
all<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.500> locust<00:01:52.800> characters<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.640> end

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
all the locust characters and in the end

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.520 
all the locust characters and in the end
this<00:01:54.179> made<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.599> feel<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.259> belong<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this made them feel like they belong in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990 
this made them feel like they belong in
the<00:01:55.619> same<00:01:55.830> world<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.580> they<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.819> came

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the same world and like they all came

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
the same world and like they all came
from<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.209> one<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.869> place<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.440> even<00:01:58.800> see

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
from that one one place you even see

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
from that one one place you even see
elements<00:01:59.789> of<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.750> real-world<00:02:00.959> things<00:02:01.470> in

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
elements of kind of real-world things in

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.710 
elements of kind of real-world things in
there<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.039> where<00:02:02.220> are<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.399> sis<00:02:03.060> against<00:02:03.330> skin

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
there so where are my sis against skin

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.859 
there so where are my sis against skin
you<00:02:03.959> start<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.289> see<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.590> skin<00:02:04.890> looks<00:02:05.160> ill<00:02:05.429> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
you start to see the skin looks ill and

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.740 
you start to see the skin looks ill and
worn<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.459> thought<00:02:08.459> wonderful<00:02:09.360> battler<00:02:09.630> hood

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
worn and thought wonderful battler hood

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
worn and thought wonderful battler hood
you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> nice<00:02:10.679> things<00:02:10.950> about

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you know one of the nice things about

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
you know one of the nice things about
remastering<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.000> sort<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.420> this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
remastering and sort of this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910 
remastering and sort of this
modernization<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.349> we're<00:02:13.470> doing<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.830> we

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
modernization that we're doing is we

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.320 
modernization that we're doing is we
have<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.849> think<00:02:14.879> about<00:02:15.090> these

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
have more time to think about these

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.850 
have more time to think about these
things<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.959> think<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
things and I think that one of the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.400 
things and I think that one of the
bigger<00:02:17.010> ones<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.370> ROM<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.790> an<00:02:17.910> example

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
bigger ones is ROM as an example

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
bigger ones is ROM as an example
you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:18.920> Rahm<00:02:19.190> used<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.150> kind<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.480> an<00:02:20.570> enemy

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you know Rahm used that kind of an enemy

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
you know Rahm used that kind of an enemy
that<00:02:20.930> came<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.170> late<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.770> ended<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.040> doing

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
that came on late and we ended up doing

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.400 
that came on late and we ended up doing
they<00:02:22.850> were<00:02:23.000> behind<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.750> production<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.320> he

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
they were behind in production so he

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140 
they were behind in production so he
sort<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.590> took<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.830> simpler<00:02:25.130> path<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.000> on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
sort of took a simpler path and so on

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.090 
sort of took a simpler path and so on
instead<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.690> putting<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> same<00:02:27.530> production

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
instead of putting the same production

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.550 
instead of putting the same production
kind<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> limitations<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.080> constraints<00:02:30.230> we

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
kind of limitations and constraints we

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.920 
kind of limitations and constraints we
had<00:02:30.710> on<00:02:30.830> us<00:02:30.980> back<00:02:31.220> then<00:02:31.520> ten<00:02:32.000> years<00:02:32.240> ago<00:02:32.360> is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
had on us back then ten years ago is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.360 
had on us back then ten years ago is
there<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> way<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.410> sort<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.830> say<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.280> had

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
there a way to sort of say if we had

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.850 
there a way to sort of say if we had
given<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.240> original<00:02:35.480> artists<00:02:36.110> an<00:02:36.500> extra

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
given the original artists an extra

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530 
given the original artists an extra
month<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.280> make<00:02:37.460> him<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:38.330> would<00:02:38.390> they<00:02:38.510> have

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
month to make him what would they have

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.450 
month to make him what would they have
potentially<00:02:39.080> done<00:02:39.200> differently<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.280> now

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
potentially done differently and so now

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.430 
potentially done differently and so now
you<00:02:40.520> see<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.240> his<00:02:41.360> visuals<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.200> in

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you see that in his visuals and and in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.960 
you see that in his visuals and and in
his<00:02:42.560> texture<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.160> his<00:02:43.280> shape<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.700> his<00:02:43.790> size

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
his texture in his shape and his size

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.670 
his texture in his shape and his size
and<00:02:44.000> his<00:02:44.210> coloring<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.140> still<00:02:45.380> true

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and his coloring is like it's still true

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.520 
and his coloring is like it's still true
to<00:02:45.920> what<00:02:46.130> Rahm<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:47.870> tweaked<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
to what Rahm was but it's tweaked a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.170 
to what Rahm was but it's tweaked a
little<00:02:49.010> bit<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> taken<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.760> little<00:02:49.880> step

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
little bit and taken a little step

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.000 
little bit and taken a little step
further<00:02:50.210> because<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:50.960> had<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.290> time<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
further because we had that time and so

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.160 
further because we had that time and so
what<00:02:52.700> we<00:02:52.790> tried<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.360> kind<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.810> really

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
what we tried to do is kind of be really

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.170 
what we tried to do is kind of be really
pay<00:02:54.740> honor<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.400> was<00:02:55.550> there<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
pay honor to what was there in the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.460 
pay honor to what was there in the
original<00:02:56.330> vision<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> original

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
original vision that the original

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.800 
original vision that the original
artists<00:02:57.860> had<00:02:58.010> yet<00:02:58.610> take<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.270> kind<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
artists had yet take it to kind of a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:17.620 
artists had yet take it to kind of a
slightly<00:03:00.080> newer<00:03:00.410> place

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.470 

did<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.230> that
