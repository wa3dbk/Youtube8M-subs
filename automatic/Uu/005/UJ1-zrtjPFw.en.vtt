00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
recording with that button there let's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
recording with that button there let's
say<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> bunch<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> boring<00:00:49.649> road<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
say you have a bunch of boring road and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
say you have a bunch of boring road and
then<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> record<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> hit<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
then you want to record and hit that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
then you want to record and hit that
button<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.309> your

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
button you're good to go also if your

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.680 
button you're good to go also if your
camera's<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> reach<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> really

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
camera's out of reach or in a really

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
camera's out of reach or in a really
weird<00:00:54.719> spot<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.320> button<00:00:59.059> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
weird spot you can use that button so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
weird spot you can use that button so
that's<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.390> handy<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.170> can't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that's really handy because it can't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
that's really handy because it can't
exactly<00:01:01.890> reach<00:01:02.190> around<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.640> camera

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
exactly reach around to the other camera

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.359 
exactly reach around to the other camera
the<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.170> thing<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.710> mounted<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the other thing is I mounted this on

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.719 
the other thing is I mounted this on
velcro<00:01:06.260> see<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.830> allows<00:01:08.130> me<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
velcro see so this allows me to take it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
velcro see so this allows me to take it
into<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> store<00:01:09.470> instead<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> leaving<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
into a store instead of leaving it on a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.450 
into a store instead of leaving it on a
bike<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> recharging<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> easier<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:14.220> use

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
bike and recharging is easier if I use

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
bike and recharging is easier if I use
the<00:01:14.700> strap<00:01:15.390> mount<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.140> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the strap mount it's a lot more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
the strap mount it's a lot more
difficult<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
difficult to get on and off and it just

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300 
difficult to get on and off and it just
basically<00:01:19.290> means<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> leave<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
basically means you got to leave it on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.390 
basically means you got to leave it on
the<00:01:20.430> bike<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> somewhere<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:22.400> go

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the bike if you go in somewhere or go

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
the bike if you go in somewhere or go
through<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> hassle<00:01:23.850> taking<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> off<00:01:24.630> every

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
through the hassle taking it off every

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
through the hassle taking it off every
time<00:01:24.930> plus<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> can't<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> any

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
time plus you can't really get to it any

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.100 
time plus you can't really get to it any
way<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> doesn't<00:01:27.780> fit<00:01:28.080> right

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
way over there it doesn't fit right

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
way over there it doesn't fit right
because<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.799> horizontal<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> strap

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
because it's horizontal and the strap

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
because it's horizontal and the strap
goes<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> you'll<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.950> mean

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
goes this way and you'll see what I mean

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219 
goes this way and you'll see what I mean
this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> by<00:01:32.939> far<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> best<00:01:33.509> way<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this is by far the best way to do it it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.700 
this is by far the best way to do it it
sticks<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.860> glue<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.790> velcro<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.710> it's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sticks like glue or like velcro and it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
sticks like glue or like velcro and it's
convenience<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.490> easy<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:40.229> rear

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
convenience very easy to get to the rear

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.639 
convenience very easy to get to the rear
mount<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> basically<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
mount is like this and so basically it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
mount is like this and so basically it's
an<00:01:46.740> upside-down<00:01:46.979> melt<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.329> adjust

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
an upside-down melt you have to adjust

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
an upside-down melt you have to adjust
that<00:01:48.750> setting<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> camera<00:01:49.799> turn<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that setting in the camera turn it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.859 
that setting in the camera turn it
upside<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
upside down so you get right to that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.230 
upside down so you get right to that
footage<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.409> bring<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
footage when you bring it in and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.530 
footage when you bring it in and
basically<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.110> flat<00:01:55.530> sticky<00:01:56.009> mount

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
basically it's the flat sticky mount

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.160 
basically it's the flat sticky mount
j-hook<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.250> extender<00:01:59.250> that<00:02:00.240> simple<00:02:00.719> extender

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
j-hook and extender that simple extender

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.760 
j-hook and extender that simple extender
comes<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.740> thick<00:02:03.680> anytime<00:02:04.680> you

have a backpack it makes the case
thicker<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.960> give<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
thicker and then they give you this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
thicker and then they give you this
extra<00:02:07.740> width<00:02:07.950> case<00:02:08.399> thing<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
that always comes with this extender

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.400 
that always comes with this extender
so<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:13.150> two<00:02:13.390> things<00:02:13.569> combined<00:02:13.990> keeps<00:02:14.290> it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so those two things combined keeps it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.980 
so those two things combined keeps it
very<00:02:14.440> simple<00:02:14.950> very<00:02:15.360> stable<00:02:16.360> there's<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.840> little

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
very simple very stable there's a little

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.470 
very simple very stable there's a little
bit<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.200> wiggle<00:02:17.410> when<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.709> hit<00:02:17.860> bumps<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:19.330> it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
bit of wiggle when I hit bumps but it's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.960 
bit of wiggle when I hit bumps but it's
not<00:02:19.720> bad<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.080> all<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.650> angle<00:02:21.310> catches

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
not bad at all and this angle catches

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.520 
not bad at all and this angle catches
just<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.300> tiny<00:02:22.480> bit<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.780> tire<00:02:22.959> which<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.380> by

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
just a tiny bit of tire which is by

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.260 
just a tiny bit of tire which is by
design<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.360> look<00:02:25.510> behind<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
design and then if you look behind it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.090 
design and then if you look behind it
you<00:02:28.270> see<00:02:28.510> how<00:02:28.630> subtle<00:02:28.990> that<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.950> have

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you see how subtle that is and I have

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.010 
you see how subtle that is and I have
the<00:02:30.220> camera<00:02:30.550> set<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.880> LED<00:02:31.240> off<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> can't

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the camera set to LED off so you can't

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.949 
the camera set to LED off so you can't
see<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.470> start<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.890> stop<00:02:33.040> recording

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
see when I start and stop recording

00:02:33.959 --> 00:03:18.830 
see when I start and stop recording
there<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.110> have

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.319 

hmm
