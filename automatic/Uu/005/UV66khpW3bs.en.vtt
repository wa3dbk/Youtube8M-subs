paper which can be seen from both sides
you<00:02:39.220> have<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.880> security<00:02:40.780> strip<00:02:41.380> when<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.740> hold

it up to the light going through the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.090 
it up to the light going through the
paper<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:45.100> which<00:02:45.850> says<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.180> hundred<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.140> USA

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
paper here which says a hundred and USA

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.170 
paper here which says a hundred and USA
on<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.550> believe<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:50.200> also<00:02:50.700> turns<00:02:51.700> pink

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
on it I believe and it also turns pink

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.110 
on it I believe and it also turns pink
under<00:02:52.600> ultraviolet<00:02:53.110> light<00:02:53.320> so<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.760> new

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
under ultraviolet light so that's a new

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.900 
under ultraviolet light so that's a new
security<00:02:55.570> feature<00:02:56.400> they're<00:02:57.400> trying<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> make

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
the area is quite a bit larger so it's

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.670 
the area is quite a bit larger so it's
really<00:04:04.989> easy<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.530> feel<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:07.560> rub<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
shoulder there and you can tell it's

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.080 
shoulder there and you can tell it's
it's<00:04:10.959> very<00:04:11.049> hard<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.620> produce<00:04:11.910> printing<00:04:12.910> press

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
it's very hard to produce printing press

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.759 
it's very hard to produce printing press
that<00:04:13.269> has<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.660> kind<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.900> impression<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.650> it

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.969 
and the one thing I notice I actually
flattened<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.109> bill<00:04:17.320> under<00:04:17.560> some<00:04:17.739> books

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
flattened this bill under some books

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.659 
flattened this bill under some books
when<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.370> got<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.820> bill<00:04:18.940> was<00:04:19.180> all<00:04:19.390> wrinkled<00:04:20.669> now

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
when I got the bill was all wrinkled now

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.640 
when I got the bill was all wrinkled now
that's<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.510> much<00:04:22.570> wrinkled<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:23.140> very<00:04:23.320> wavy

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
that's so much wrinkled it was very wavy

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.830 
that's so much wrinkled it was very wavy
it<00:04:24.160> wasn't<00:04:24.520> very<00:04:24.729> flat<00:04:25.060> at<00:04:25.210> all

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
it wasn't very flat at all

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.900 
it wasn't very flat at all
and<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.470> guess<00:04:26.650> that's<00:04:26.830> one<00:04:27.250> reason<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.610> they

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
and I guess that's one reason that they

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.610 
and I guess that's one reason that they
delayed<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.450> printing<00:04:28.840> process<00:04:29.020> because

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
delayed the printing process because

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.590 
delayed the printing process because
because<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.580> all<00:04:30.760> these<00:04:31.000> things<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
because of all these things the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.240 
because of all these things the
impressions<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.530> different<00:04:32.860> inks<00:04:33.100> and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
impressions and the different inks and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.830 
impressions and the different inks and
the<00:04:33.430> threads<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.330> everything<00:04:34.660> they<00:04:34.810> were

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the threads and everything they were

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.420 
the threads and everything they were
actually<00:04:35.380> getting<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.919> bills<00:04:36.100> were<00:04:36.220> getting

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
actually getting the bills were getting

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.270 
actually getting the bills were getting
creased<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.139> then<00:04:38.139> when<00:04:38.650> they<00:04:38.770> got<00:04:38.889> released

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
creased and then when they got released

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.620 
creased and then when they got released
there<00:04:39.490> was<00:04:39.580> areas<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.030> weren't<00:04:40.180> printed

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
there was areas that weren't printed

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.120 
there was areas that weren't printed
because<00:04:40.900> they<00:04:41.050> were<00:04:41.110> within<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.800> creased

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
because they were within the creased

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.430 
because they were within the creased
area<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.310> is<00:04:45.610> ten<00:04:46.210> years<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.720> research<00:04:47.139> in

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
area so this is ten years of research in

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.500 
area so this is ten years of research in
the<00:04:47.560> making<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.280> security<00:04:48.880> features<00:04:49.270> on

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
the making of the security features on

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.080 
the making of the security features on
the<00:04:49.660> bill<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:51.190> hopefully<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.580> works<00:04:51.730> out<00:04:51.940> well

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
the bill so hopefully it works out well

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.830 
the bill so hopefully it works out well
also<00:04:52.990> they<00:04:53.950> have<00:04:54.130> some<00:04:54.400> new<00:04:54.610> things<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.660> for

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
also they have some new things just for

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.120 
also they have some new things just for
recognizability<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.960> know<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.650> bill<00:04:59.860> it

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
recognizability you know the bill it

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.370 
recognizability you know the bill it
takes<00:05:01.030> on<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.240> color<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.690> got<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:01.930> blueish

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
takes on a color it's got a blueish

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.770 
takes on a color it's got a blueish
background<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.730> can<00:05:03.850> quickly<00:05:04.270> look

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
background to it so you can quickly look

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.690 
background to it so you can quickly look
in<00:05:05.020> your<00:05:05.680> wallet<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.100> you're<00:05:06.310> not<00:05:06.460> going<00:05:06.580> to

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
in your wallet and you're not going to

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.670 
in your wallet and you're not going to
accidentally<00:05:07.120> give<00:05:07.419> somebody<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:08.200> hundred

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
accidentally give somebody a hundred

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.960 
accidentally give somebody a hundred
instead<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.280> ten<00:05:09.490> because<00:05:09.669> they're<00:05:09.880> going

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
instead of a ten because they're going

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.090 
instead of a ten because they're going
to<00:05:10.030> be<00:05:10.090> different<00:05:10.419> colors<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.850> nice

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
to be different colors so that is nice

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.350

bill might as well have back of the hall
right<00:05:54.030> there<00:05:55.030> is<00:05:55.330> micro<00:05:56.289> printing<00:05:56.770> all<00:05:57.010> over
