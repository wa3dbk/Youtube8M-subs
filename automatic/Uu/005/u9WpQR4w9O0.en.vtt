little kids in the house obviously all

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
little kids in the house obviously all
your<00:01:05.040> guns<00:01:05.339> should<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.549> locked<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.090> that's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
your guns should be locked up and that's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
your guns should be locked up and that's
one<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> reasons<00:01:07.710> why<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.189> safe

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
one of the reasons why I have this safe

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.990 
one of the reasons why I have this safe
in<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> we'll<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.790> further

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
in here so we'll get into some further

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.050 
in here so we'll get into some further
stuff<00:01:15.290> there<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.409> go

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
stuff there we go

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
stuff there we go
so<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> punch<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> code<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> door

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so you punch in the code and the door

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.600 
so you punch in the code and the door
opens<00:01:26.100> automatically<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.409> lights<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.860> at

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
opens automatically the lights are on at

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
opens automatically the lights are on at
night<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.390> does<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> keypad<00:01:31.290> does

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
night this does the keypad does

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
night this does the keypad does
illuminate<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.180> interior<00:01:33.750> lighting

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
illuminate it has interior lighting

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.340 
illuminate it has interior lighting
which<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
which you can kind of see okay it just

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.810 
which you can kind of see okay it just
turned<00:01:37.560> off<00:01:39.740> things<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:40.979> nice<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
turned off things that are nice is the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
turned off things that are nice is the
way<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> system<00:01:45.450> design<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.079> built<00:01:46.320> really

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
way the system design it's built really

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.800 
way the system design it's built really
thick<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:47.939> gauge<00:01:48.149> steel<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
thick I don't know what gauge steel that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
thick I don't know what gauge steel that
is<00:01:49.369> offhand<00:01:51.740> putting<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.130> easy<00:01:53.270> just

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
is offhand putting it in was easy just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
is offhand putting it in was easy just
make<00:01:54.450> sure<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.710> no

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
make sure you know that there's no

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.249 
make sure you know that there's no
electrical<00:01:56.399> wires<00:01:56.579> behind<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
electrical wires behind it think of a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780 
electrical wires behind it think of a
place<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.680> close<00:01:59.009> enough<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> plug

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
place that's close enough to a plug

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.959 
place that's close enough to a plug
where<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.329> plug<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:02.490> recharge

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
where you can plug in the the recharge

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.740 
where you can plug in the the recharge
part<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:04.409> plugs<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
part it plugs right into here so that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.740 
part it plugs right into here so that's
the<00:02:06.960> plug<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.629> figure<00:02:09.629> out

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the plug I have it you know figure out

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.540 
the plug I have it you know figure out
where<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.500> plug<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> cord<00:02:11.220> let<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
where you can plug in the cord let it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
where you can plug in the cord let it
plug<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.209> eight<00:02:12.270> hours<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:12.959> and

the battery there I did have problems
right<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.440> beginning<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:58.950> guess<00:02:59.040> they

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
right in the beginning I guess they

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.699 
right in the beginning I guess they
switch<00:02:59.579> batteries<00:03:00.239> which<00:03:01.139> was<00:03:01.290> good<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
switch batteries which was good but you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.129 
switch batteries which was good but you
can<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:02.099> it's<00:03:02.940> got<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> nice<00:03:03.299> big<00:03:03.569> battery<00:03:03.989> in

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
can see it's got a nice big battery in

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.140 
can see it's got a nice big battery in
it<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.620> worry<00:03:04.769> about

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
it so you don't have to worry about

in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.260> beginning<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.099> battery<00:03:11.579> was<00:03:12.060> not

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
in the beginning the the battery was not

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.149 
in the beginning the the battery was not
holding<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.659> charge<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.290> talked<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.069> the

so that if there's a lighted weapon they

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.349 
so that if there's a lighted weapon they
may<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.099> changed<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.639> process<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> little

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
may have changed the process a little

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.839 
may have changed the process a little

competition barrel on it or something

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.490 
competition barrel on it or something
it'll<00:04:40.050> definitely<00:04:40.320> work<00:04:41.040> just<00:04:41.310> fine

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
it'll definitely work just fine

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.200 
it'll definitely work just fine
