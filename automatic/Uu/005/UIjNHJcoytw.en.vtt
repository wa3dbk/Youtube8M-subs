00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.630 
first one of the year for me kind of got
any<00:05:25.510> better<00:05:25.690> as<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.710> right<00:05:26.890> now<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.130> plan<00:05:27.460> will

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
any better as of right now the plan will

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.630 
any better as of right now the plan will
be<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.790> go<00:05:28.030> over<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.800> Eastern<00:05:29.800> Washington<00:05:30.460> and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
be to go over to Eastern Washington and

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.380 
be to go over to Eastern Washington and
go<00:05:31.360> hunt<00:05:31.660> over<00:05:32.230> there<00:05:32.730> we<00:05:33.730> know<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:33.880> few<00:05:34.120> spots

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
go hunt over there we know a few spots

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.210 
go hunt over there we know a few spots
over<00:05:34.630> there<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.320> holds<00:05:35.680> pretty<00:05:35.710> well<00:05:35.950> in

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
over there that it holds pretty well in

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.610 
over there that it holds pretty well in
November<00:05:36.640> so<00:05:36.960> depending<00:05:37.960> on<00:05:38.050> how<00:05:38.260> it<00:05:38.380> goes

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
November so depending on how it goes

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.670 
November so depending on how it goes
most<00:05:39.160> likely<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:40.330> next<00:05:40.570> hunt<00:05:40.780> will<00:05:41.320> be<00:05:41.470> over

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
most likely the next hunt will be over

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.430 
most likely the next hunt will be over
