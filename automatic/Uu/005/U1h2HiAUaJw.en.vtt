00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.360
 tributes in defense and found to the conquest of the gib other nations but in 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.359
 His moment could not stop in time 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.340
 This is the first work destined to commemorate the survival of a 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.970
 species 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 our species 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.700
 it is a tribute to the man who returned the final 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
 what uncle to humanity without future 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.340
 the first chief master officer 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.410
 that's why it's not surprising that the work is so special 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.940
 started three years ago in 2006 107 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.340
 the monument is a diorama built entirely by hand 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.070
 is a three-dimensional photograph of the battle and the soldiers who 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.220
 they fought in it 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 pity has been reproduced with the utmost meticulousness respecting the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.500
 authenticity of every detail only men and women who were 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.230
 there they could contract 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 With more precision 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.810
 he was discovering his secrets of his creation 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.829
 to ensure historical fidelity, the space command was requested 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.120
 of the united nations the archives with those scanned by intel 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.970
 tion of the Marines who participated in the battle 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 in this way the artists could determine the true face of each 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.650
 soldier 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.390
 once the face was completed, a body was assigned 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.610
 that has been rendered together with rises per thousand mature 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 the confirmation of whether he felt bad 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040
 just as the artist conceived this tribute to the karadzic humanity he had to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.300
 be molded by the hand of man without the help of robotic systems 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.520
 modeling 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 Everything is hand made 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.649
 the position of the gib 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:12.859
 the battlefield 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.009
 so much so that the victorious soldiers as well as the street 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.719
 based on topographic maps of the battle date the artists 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.179
 they could almost exactly reproduce paco linares T-shirt and each 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.329
 barral 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.760
 but one of his days having always creation of the year 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.779
 the contest is over 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.719
 in the archives of the buildings 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.349
 perfectly preserved employees and each and every one of the structures 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.699
 The challenge was not simply to recover the structures but also 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.679
 know how he responds 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.639
 the artists worked from the blueprints to recreate the devastation 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.769
 caused by the fierce fighting from the bullet holes to the claws 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.779
 of the concrete that had been exposed 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.449
 finally our enemies were also rendered with meticulous 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.179
 detail 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.000
 the corpses of the condemned 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.129
 who recovered after the battle 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.519
 if the season triumphs 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.459
 finally to complete the have studied authentic weapons and ties 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.249
 for criminal

 to remove the detainees as

 the maximum organism 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.619
 by placing the covenants in front of the sailors

 the clear image of between the summits of history 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.899
 we see like the previous lower films in inferior weapons the judge 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.439
 we realize it 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.299
 half a century ago 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.299
 and this is to say that pushed up to him
