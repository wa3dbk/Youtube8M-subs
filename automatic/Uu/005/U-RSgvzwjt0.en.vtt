today's<00:00:20.520> tip<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.150> pretty<00:00:21.630> nice<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.140> actually

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
today's tip is pretty nice it's actually

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.590 
today's tip is pretty nice it's actually
one<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> more<00:00:23.820> glitchy<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.269> things<00:00:24.449> I've

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
one of the more glitchy of things I've

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
one of the more glitchy of things I've
seen<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> game<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> year<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.609> first

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
seen in the game this year and the first

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
seen in the game this year and the first
move<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.570> from<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> post<00:00:28.349> animation<00:00:28.980> you're

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
move is from the post animation you're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.759 
move is from the post animation you're
trying<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> spin<00:00:29.900> opposite<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> dribble

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
trying to spin opposite up the dribble

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
trying to spin opposite up the dribble
so<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.279> dribbling<00:00:32.430> left<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> post

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so if you're dribbling left in the post

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.970 
so if you're dribbling left in the post
simulation<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:33.960> spin<00:00:34.260> back<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> right

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
simulation would spin back to the right

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.490 
simulation would spin back to the right
and<00:00:35.250> vice<00:00:35.910> versa<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.690> you'll<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.200> able<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> get

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and vice versa and you'll be able to get

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930 
and vice versa and you'll be able to get
the<00:00:37.620> rim<00:00:37.800> most<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.700> move

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the rim most of the time with this move

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.750 
the rim most of the time with this move
and<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:40.500> want<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.430> center

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and you want to do it more in the center

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
and you want to do it more in the center
of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> court<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.600> majority<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> time

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
of the court the majority of the time

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.139 
of the court the majority of the time
because<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> towards<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
because if you do it towards the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.840 
because if you do it towards the
baseline<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.960> towards<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.219> sides<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
baseline or towards the sides of the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
baseline or towards the sides of the
court<00:00:48.090> you'll<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.660> weird<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.739> turbo

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
court you'll get this weird like turbo

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.170 
court you'll get this weird like turbo
animation<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> they'll<00:00:50.969> take<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
animation and they'll take you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
animation and they'll take you
completely<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> play<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
completely out of that play so you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.049 
completely out of that play so you
really<00:00:53.070> can't<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> rim<00:00:53.699> any<00:00:53.850> more

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
really can't get to the rim any more

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
really can't get to the rim any more
let's<00:00:54.750> check<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.050> clips<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.590> here

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
let's check out some clips right here

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.200 
let's check out some clips right here
with<00:00:55.890> John<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.250> he<00:00:56.370> gets<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> rim<00:00:56.760> gets

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
with John well he gets to the rim gets

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
with John well he gets to the rim gets
blocked<00:00:57.480> by<00:00:57.690> power<00:00:58.320> Gasol<00:00:58.710> who<00:00:59.579> basically

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
blocked by power Gasol who basically

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
blocked by power Gasol who basically
just<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> 50<00:01:00.989> 20<00:01:01.260> game<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> couple<00:01:01.949> days<00:01:02.070> ago

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
just had a 50 20 game a couple days ago

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
just had a 50 20 game a couple days ago
so<00:01:02.399> he's<00:01:02.789> been<00:01:02.940> killing<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.719> late<00:01:03.960> but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so he's been killing it as of late but

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.820 
so he's been killing it as of late but
yes<00:01:05.549> some<00:01:05.880> nice<00:01:06.360> moves<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.990> past<00:01:07.229> week<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
yes some nice moves this past week have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.520 
yes some nice moves this past week have
been<00:01:08.299> Jeff<00:01:09.299> green<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> Grizz<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.380> gonna

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
been Jeff green at the Grizz I'm gonna

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.020 
been Jeff green at the Grizz I'm gonna
review<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> team<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.820> really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
review that team I think they really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.080 
review that team I think they really
nice<00:01:12.150> seen<00:01:12.450> 2k<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.320> well<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.090> probably

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
nice seen 2k now as well and probably

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
nice seen 2k now as well and probably
not<00:01:15.330> starting<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
not starting something more as well I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.219 
not starting something more as well I
try<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> use<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> Atlanta<00:01:17.580> Hawks<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.330> it's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
try to use the Atlanta Hawks but it's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.890 
try to use the Atlanta Hawks but it's
just<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> same<00:01:20.119> because<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> Hawks<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
just not the same because the Hawks I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.370 
just not the same because the Hawks I
mean<00:01:22.110> Korver<00:01:22.799> shot<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:24.119> terrible<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
mean Korver shot is so like terrible and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
mean Korver shot is so like terrible and
I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.009> him<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.250> demerit<00:01:26.909> Carol<00:01:27.210> jumpers

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I think him and demerit Carol jumpers

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.210 
I think him and demerit Carol jumpers
should<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.810> changed<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.619> least<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> timing

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
should be changed or at least the timing

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
should be changed or at least the timing
should<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.430> changed<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.720> should

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
should be changed because they should

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.210 
should be changed because they should
fall<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> higher<00:01:31.380> rate<00:01:31.619> where<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:31.950> don't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
fall at a higher rate where they don't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
fall at a higher rate where they don't
and<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.270> makes<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.570> unusable<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.170> some

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and it just makes them unusable at some

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
and it just makes them unusable at some
time<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.829> I'm<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:36.180> wouldn't<00:01:36.390> recommend

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
time so I'm probably wouldn't recommend

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
time so I'm probably wouldn't recommend
using<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:37.920> pretty<00:01:38.159> bad

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
using them because they are pretty bad

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
using them because they are pretty bad
but<00:01:38.880> yeah<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.750> sure<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.020> settings<00:01:40.200> an

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
but yeah make sure your settings an

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
but yeah make sure your settings an

physical<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.180> Oregon's<00:03:27.570> pace<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.230> tempo<00:03:28.650> but
