00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi friends snap drop shot 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 texas caroline accessories were 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 designed for catching perch basically 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 drop shot split shot is deep 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.410
 snap here we can count on 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.130
 larger fish such as zander and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 pike for example snap simple leashes 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.289
 no we do not need to do on the main 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.860
 fishing line need to retreat 50 centimeters 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.899
 can be a little more a little less 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:43.710
 depending on the weather 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:49.550
 selected sinker and when determined 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.770
 with these moments proceed to equip 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.190
 installation of the tooling itself retreated to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.160
 place 50 centimeters we need to tie 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.949
 our offset hook so that it looks 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.890
 sting up where our fishing line comes from 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:17.369
 there we will tie a palomar in this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:20.159
 situations will suit me personally about alomar 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 tie the offset hook so that it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:31.110
 looked at the right direction i will do 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:37.640
 a leash a little smaller to visually 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 was clearly visible in the camera lens 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.869
 we wet the knot 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.140
 tightened and now let's see everything 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:04.160
 correct our offset hook 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:07.160
 looking up now on the edge we will tie 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 sinker 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.709
 too, can this be tied to evil 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:45.420
 pike of course if such a snap 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 she can bite off your fishing line montage 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 iron leash here would be out of place 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:02.790
 tied up sinker unnecessary edge cut off 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:17.790
 that's what we get in principle 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.960
 this and all the tackle is nothing complicated on the chain 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.960
 im our twister 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.360
 use for bottom 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.360
 step wiring 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.769
 pinned our Mr. 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:12.349
 and all tackle is ready all good luck in catching 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:14.859
