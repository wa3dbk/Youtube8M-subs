draw<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.250> first<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.400> start<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
draw it first you start out with the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.740 
draw it first you start out with the
handle<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:20.250> gotta<00:00:20.460> make<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.789> kind<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> thin

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
handle you gotta make it kind of thin

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.620 
handle you gotta make it kind of thin
because<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.650> fat<00:00:23.330> then<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> looks<00:00:24.600> like

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
because if it's fat then it looks like

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.200 
because if it's fat then it looks like
nobody<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.109> hold<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:28.220> after<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.400> finish<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
handle you start with the blade just

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
handle you start with the blade just
like<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:37.190> then<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.430> draw<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> point<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
like that then you draw the point to the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:49.319 
like that then you draw the point to the
blades

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.819 

then<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.410> there's<00:00:51.040> a<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.260> blade<00:00:53.530> there's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.049 
there's dimmer edges so you're gonna
have<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.550> draw<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:59.050> edges<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.920> blade

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.130 

see<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.390> blade<00:01:04.570> has<00:01:04.780> four<00:01:05.050> sides<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.960> this

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
see this blade has four sides so this

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.469 
see this blade has four sides so this
shows<00:01:08.380> two<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.759> then<00:01:09.880> on<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.119> other<00:01:10.180> side

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479
