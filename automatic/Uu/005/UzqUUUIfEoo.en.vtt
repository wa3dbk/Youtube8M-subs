it's<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.890> put<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.400> spirit<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it's here that we put the spirit to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.090 
it's here that we put the spirit to
sleep<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> period<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> several<00:00:19.949> years

until such times is fully mature let me
explain<00:00:29.669> a<00:00:29.730> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.300> maturation

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
explain a little bit about maturation

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
explain a little bit about maturation
it's<00:00:31.980> here

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it's here

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's here
that<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> spirit<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> transformed<00:00:34.500> into

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that the spirit is transformed into

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.220 
that the spirit is transformed into
whiskey<00:00:35.480> legally<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.660> takes<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.200> years

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
whiskey legally this takes three years

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.320 
whiskey legally this takes three years
but<00:00:37.650> in<00:00:37.770> practice<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> great<00:00:39.060> malt

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
but in practice with a great malt

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.260 
but in practice with a great malt
whiskey<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> takes<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.410> much<00:00:40.650> longer<00:00:41.270> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
whiskey this takes much much longer so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.170 
whiskey this takes much much longer so
three<00:00:42.570> processes<00:00:43.140> involved<00:00:44.180> subtraction

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
three processes involved subtraction

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
three processes involved subtraction
addition<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.800> interaction<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> the

addition and then interaction so the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.620 
addition and then interaction so the
numeric<00:00:49.110> spirit<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.490> all<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.360> of

numeric spirit first of all it's kind of

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.840 
numeric spirit first of all it's kind of
a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.530> rough<00:00:52.800> although<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.490> clean

new<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.050> spirit<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.890> absorbed<00:00:59.700> by<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.970> wood

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
new make spirit are absorbed by the wood

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.179 
new make spirit are absorbed by the wood
secondly<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.670> addition<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.150> color<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
secondly the addition of color and of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
secondly the addition of color and of
sugars<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.640> other<00:01:05.909> compounds<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> wood

sugars and other compounds from the wood

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.580 
sugars and other compounds from the wood
are<00:01:07.710> delivered<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.609> the<00:01:08.939> spirit<00:01:09.329> itself<00:01:09.719> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
are delivered into the spirit itself and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.499 
are delivered into the spirit itself and
thirdly<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.520> being<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.359> most

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
thirdly and for being actually the most

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.020 
thirdly and for being actually the most
interesting<00:01:13.170> part<00:01:13.469> is<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.280> interaction

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
interesting part is the interaction

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
interesting part is the interaction
between<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.810> compounds<00:01:16.469> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> wood<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
between the compounds of the wood and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.849 
between the compounds of the wood and
the<00:01:18.090> esters<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.600> other<00:01:18.749> compounds<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
the esters and other compounds in the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.239 
the esters and other compounds in the
spirit<00:01:20.219> itself<00:01:21.200> these<00:01:22.200> collectively<00:01:22.920> then

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
spirit itself these collectively then

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.880 
spirit itself these collectively then
will<00:01:23.460> generate<00:01:23.939> new<00:01:24.509> flavours<00:01:25.140> new<00:01:25.409> esters

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
will generate new flavours new esters

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.309 
will generate new flavours new esters
and<00:01:26.009> new<00:01:26.159> aldehydes<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.049> give

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
and new aldehydes which will then give

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.800 
and new aldehydes which will then give
whiskey<00:01:28.799> his<00:01:29.100> characteristic<00:01:30.030> personality

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
whiskey his characteristic personality

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
whiskey his characteristic personality
in<00:01:31.499> each<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.219> first<00:01:32.369> two<00:01:32.640> years<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:33.060> lose

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
in each of the first two years we lose

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.639 
in each of the first two years we lose
2%<00:01:33.719> of<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.619> volume<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.249> thereafter<00:01:36.119> 1%<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
2% of the volume and thereafter 1% this

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.440 
2% of the volume and thereafter 1% this

we're<00:01:43.829> also<00:01:44.280> gaining<00:01:44.759> water<00:01:45.539> from<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
we're also gaining water from the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.020 
we're also gaining water from the
humidity<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.859> damaged<00:01:47.159> warehouse<00:01:47.609> and

humidity of the damaged warehouse and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.809 
humidity of the damaged warehouse and
this<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.840> reduce<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.530> strength<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.639> not

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
this will reduce the strength so not

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.489 
this will reduce the strength so not
only<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.060> losing<00:01:51.539> volume<00:01:51.719> but<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.319> also

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
only you losing volume but you're also

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.819 
only you losing volume but you're also
losing<00:01:52.889> strength<00:01:53.459> typically<00:01:54.499> when<00:01:55.499> you<00:01:55.649> make

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
losing strength typically when you make

spirit is put into a cask it goes into

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
spirit is put into a cask it goes into

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
the pout 69.8% after 20 years it might
come<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:04.289> about<00:02:04.499> 55<00:02:05.490> percent<00:02:05.999> alcohol<00:02:07.280> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
come out at about 55 percent alcohol so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.029 
come out at about 55 percent alcohol so
it's<00:02:08.700> an<00:02:08.850> expensive<00:02:09.360> process<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.800> where
