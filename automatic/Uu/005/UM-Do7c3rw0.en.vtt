00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.140 
overhead it took him all of these rounds
to<00:04:02.829> plan<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.220> sequence<00:04:03.549> out<00:04:03.670> but<00:04:03.820> he<00:04:03.880> planned

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
to plan that sequence out but he planned

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.130 
to plan that sequence out but he planned
it<00:04:04.269> perfectly

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
it perfectly

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.440 
it perfectly
he's<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.770> been<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:06.100> for<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> lot<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.910> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
he's really been going for a lot of the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
he's really been going for a lot of the
lows<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.530> finally<00:04:08.710> he<00:04:09.069> got<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> payoff<00:04:09.700> by

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
lows and so finally he got the payoff by

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.400 
lows and so finally he got the payoff by
doing<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.240> overhead<00:04:10.569> see<00:04:10.750> there<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.170> low

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
doing the overhead see there is a low

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.230 
doing the overhead see there is a low
again<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.250> time<00:04:12.310> he<00:04:12.580> changes<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.060> into<00:04:13.090> a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
again but this time he changes it into a

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.259 
again but this time he changes it into a
throw<00:04:13.540> he's<00:04:14.020> earned<00:04:14.530> all<00:04:14.709> of<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.250> want<00:04:16.030> this

if that's gonna be fast enough to catch
it<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.790> look<00:05:12.970> at<00:05:13.060> how<00:05:13.210> he<00:05:13.270> walks<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:13.870> it's

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
it and look at how he walks and it's

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.570 
it and look at how he walks and it's
like<00:05:14.140> it's<00:05:14.440> like<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.620> lesion<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.190> discipline
