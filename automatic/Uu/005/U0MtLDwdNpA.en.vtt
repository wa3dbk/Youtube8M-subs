00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello my opinion dangerous then you say 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.000
 I take 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.719
 Why 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.069
 but as I said on the phone I needed 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.789
 a teacher 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.519
 he can not because sleeve 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 in the morning except the sportsman and not just because we have already found 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 no score without appeal from this party 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 when I do not know 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 expected as are already suddenly 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 while m it also counts 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 it's settled 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.520
 story you would have to extend it 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.040
 in Spain so blurry the child asleep this project reports the afp that falls well I 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.160
 have been to spain in spain 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 she died 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.870
 3 not very common no but even driving it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.890
 we do not cling to power but we like 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.680
 text 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 point 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 according to var good morning loser so they play very long 4:30 cascade 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 convenient 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 so we can come 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 when we are a hundredth 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.500
 ap 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 it probably comes from reproducing course at nanterre 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.510
 like that in a statement 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 Note 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.050
 do not miss the arms certainly no source not to say but who will pay 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.080
 I do not know 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.870
 true 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.740
 and what I did a bad sign yeah such high point to change 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.710
 Something 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.400
 this is not the time 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 pat mcquaid 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.720
 do not keep me in the shooters a twilight 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.200
 I wrote mediapart we have our idea 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.859
 for now he's scared 10 hours m 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.590
 later 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.899
 it's a great moment 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.249
 he 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.869
 an offer 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.249
 I also want 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 dormitory hilton a name in the north his amendment 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.620
 without success 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.049
 Abhisit 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.049
 you were not good here it's a bit like gold here's what 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.189
 I explain why 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.790
 come ap when his mass is said he will go 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.689
 we drove 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 it may be better so 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.409
 ayalon dr 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 he 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.979
 yes the far right and some gaps 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.030
 4 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.349
 no no he will leave more 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.010
 it's something 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.629
 as evidence this point 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.589
 that's why the whole 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.709
 wrongly 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.969
 I came as a citizen of Spain 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.129
 why then the amount of the same order scattered we do not know yet very 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.129
 Well, it's not signed yet 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 executed located what he wants 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.339
 for m speech 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.339

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.019
 ab3 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.840

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.219
 two hours before 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.219
 two hours is not an isolated case yesterday 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.739
 but the big loan did not have to run one morning the selections 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.649
 hardly the heaviest 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.839
 results he warned 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.319
