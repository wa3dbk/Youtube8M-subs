00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
very very underrated guys you know it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.820 
very very underrated guys you know it's
a<00:01:22.770> lower<00:01:22.979> kill<00:01:23.280> streak<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.710> lot<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> people

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
a lower kill streak and a lot of people

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
a lower kill streak and a lot of people
have<00:01:26.040> known<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.180> nobody<00:01:28.020> has

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have known it's good but nobody has

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
have known it's good but nobody has
really<00:01:28.380> used<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> his<00:01:29.250> potential<00:01:29.670> yet<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
really used it to his potential yet and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
really used it to his potential yet and
in<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.229> game<00:01:31.500> play<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
in this game play I think it's one of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.609 
in this game play I think it's one of
the<00:01:32.549> first<00:01:32.670> game<00:01:32.970> plays<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.229> used<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the first game plays where it's used to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.940 
the first game plays where it's used to
its<00:01:34.740> complete<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.900> most<00:01:36.900> potential<00:01:37.500> because

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
its complete and most potential because

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
its complete and most potential because
it<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.159> absolutely<00:01:38.759> tears<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.540> enemy<00:01:39.869> up

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it just absolutely tears the enemy up

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
it just absolutely tears the enemy up
especially<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.710> he's<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.950> his<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
especially when he's in his and the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.200 
especially when he's in his and the
spawn<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> escort<00:01:43.320> drone<00:01:43.829> basically<00:01:44.670> acts<00:01:44.880> as

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
spawn the escort drone basically acts as

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.710 
spawn the escort drone basically acts as
the<00:01:45.420> age<00:01:45.630> six<00:01:46.049> overwatch<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.880> modern<00:01:48.659> warfare

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the age six overwatch in modern warfare

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
the age six overwatch in modern warfare
3<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.530> I'd<00:01:50.460> say<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.180> more

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
3 and I'd say it is a little more

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
3 and I'd say it is a little more
powerful<00:01:51.960> than<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.590> modern<00:01:52.890> warfare

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
powerful than the one in modern warfare

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
powerful than the one in modern warfare
3<00:01:53.130> maybe<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.930> powerful<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.829> take

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
3 maybe it's a very powerful it can take

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
3 maybe it's a very powerful it can take
out<00:01:56.280> enemies<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.759> longer<00:01:57.119> range<00:01:57.360> kills<00:01:58.049> them

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
out enemies at longer range kills them

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
out enemies at longer range kills them
quick<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.399> basically<00:01:59.610> follows<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
quick and it basically follows you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
quick and it basically follows you
around<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.219> now<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> guys<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
around and now that you guys know that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.370 
around and now that you guys know that
the<00:02:03.630> swarm<00:02:04.290> has<00:02:04.409> been<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.990> patched<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the swarm has been you know patched and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.619 
the swarm has been you know patched and
it's<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.340> strong<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.119> anymore<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it's not as strong as it is anymore it's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479 
it's not as strong as it is anymore it's
actually<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.110> weak<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
actually really weak I think kind of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.460 
actually really weak I think kind of
makes<00:02:11.610> me<00:02:11.700> mad<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.879> they<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
makes me mad that they have to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.590 
makes me mad that they have to
to<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:13.160> those<00:02:13.310> higher<00:02:13.610> killstreaks<00:02:14.270> less

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
to make those higher killstreaks less

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.780 
to make those higher killstreaks less
powerful<00:02:15.100> when<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.190> takes<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.430> lot<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> earn

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
powerful when it takes a lot to earn

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.160 
powerful when it takes a lot to earn
those<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:18.200> unfortunate<00:02:18.770> but<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
those it's unfortunate but you know it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.410 
those it's unfortunate but you know it
is<00:02:21.320> what<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.220> swarm<00:02:22.610> basically

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
is what it is now the swarm basically

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.490 
is what it is now the swarm basically
only<00:02:23.630> gets<00:02:24.050> about<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.850> two<00:02:26.690> or<00:02:26.870> three<00:02:26.900> kills

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
only gets about like two or three kills

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.010 
only gets about like two or three kills
and<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.580> dogs<00:02:28.880> will<00:02:29.060> get<00:02:29.210> like<00:02:29.330> six<00:02:29.600> kills<00:02:29.870> in

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
and the dogs will get like six kills in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.300 
and the dogs will get like six kills in
the<00:02:30.080> same<00:02:30.260> time<00:02:30.410> used<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.890> opposite

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
the same time used to be the opposite

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.250 
the same time used to be the opposite
it's<00:02:32.000> really<00:02:32.180> weak<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:32.810> definitely<00:02:33.020> not

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
it's really weak now it's definitely not

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.690 
it's really weak now it's definitely not
as<00:02:33.380> strong<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:33.860> still<00:02:34.070> powerful<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.580> it's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
as strong it's still powerful but it's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.870 
as strong it's still powerful but it's
not<00:02:34.820> as<00:02:34.940> strong<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:36.320> yeah<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> escort<00:02:37.670> drone

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
not as strong but yeah the escort drone

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.050 
not as strong but yeah the escort drone
is<00:02:38.060> very<00:02:38.480> very<00:02:38.660> powerful<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.790> honestly<00:02:40.790> you

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
is very very powerful and honestly you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.520 
is very very powerful and honestly you
can<00:02:41.210> replace<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.720> with<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> swarm<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.410> could

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
can replace it with a swarm you could

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.460 
can replace it with a swarm you could
basically<00:02:42.680> run<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.840> either<00:02:44.930> run<00:02:45.170> as

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
basically run you can either run as

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
basically run you can either run as
squirt<00:02:45.980> lodestar<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.850> dogs<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.840> could<00:02:48.050> do

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
squirt lodestar and dogs or you could do

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.810 
squirt lodestar and dogs or you could do
orbital<00:02:49.490> vsat<00:02:50.380> loads<00:02:51.380> or<00:02:51.650> escort<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.340> dog

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
orbital vsat loads or escort and dog

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.730 
orbital vsat loads or escort and dog
something<00:02:53.240> like<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> definitely

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
something like that but I definitely

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.699 
something like that but I definitely
think<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:56.420> escort<00:02:56.959> drone<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.470> be<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
think that the escort drone can be the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.100 
think that the escort drone can be the
next<00:02:58.040> killstreak<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.790> kind<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.330> replace<00:02:59.810> the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
next killstreak to kind of replace the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.380 
next killstreak to kind of replace the
swarms<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.770> just<00:03:01.400> don't<00:03:01.700> think<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.180> these

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
swarms I just don't think that these

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.600 
swarms I just don't think that these
swarms<00:03:02.720> work<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.890> potential<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.459> they

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
swarms work to the potential that they

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.350 
swarms work to the potential that they
should<00:03:04.910> or<00:03:05.450> as<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:05.780> used<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:07.360> definitely

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
should or as they used to and definitely

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.730 
should or as they used to and definitely
think<00:03:08.720> you're<00:03:08.810> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.990> start<00:03:09.110> seeing<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.440> lot

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
think you're going to start seeing a lot

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.710 
think you're going to start seeing a lot
more<00:03:09.770> game<00:03:10.190> plays<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.790> future<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
more game plays in the future with the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.440 
more game plays in the future with the
escort<00:03:12.260> drone<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.820> as<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.090> see<00:03:14.120> he's<00:03:14.420> in

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
escort drone and as you can see he's in

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.560 
escort drone and as you can see he's in
this<00:03:14.690> blonde<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.350> he's<00:03:15.440> basically<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:16.370> 10<00:03:16.940> his

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
this blonde and he's basically is 10 his

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.970 
this blonde and he's basically is 10 his
that<00:03:17.660> skirt<00:03:17.870> drones<00:03:18.080> absolutely<00:03:18.680> tearing

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
that skirt drones absolutely tearing

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.820 
that skirt drones absolutely tearing
things<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.200> getting<00:03:21.440> constant

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
things up it's just getting constant

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.400 
things up it's just getting constant
kills<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.640> right<00:03:22.820> here<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.260> before<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.350> was

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
kills not right here but before it was

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.740 
kills not right here but before it was
getting<00:03:24.620> constant<00:03:24.980> kills<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.750> basically

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
getting constant kills and it basically

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.900 
getting constant kills and it basically
just<00:03:27.050> sees<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.410> enemy<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.010> kills<00:03:28.190> them<00:03:28.310> it's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
just sees the enemy and kills them it's

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.960 
just sees the enemy and kills them it's
really<00:03:29.180> good<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.560> yeah<00:03:30.709> this<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.100> crazy

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
really good but yeah this is a crazy

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.410 
really good but yeah this is a crazy
game<00:03:32.239> play<00:03:32.510> 199<00:03:33.440> kills<00:03:33.769> I'm<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.610> unfortunate

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
game play 199 kills I'm it's unfortunate

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.240 
game play 199 kills I'm it's unfortunate
that<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.900> couldn't<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.440> gotten<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:37.010> more

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
that it couldn't have gotten one more

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.090 
that it couldn't have gotten one more
kill<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.700> made<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.390> 200<00:03:38.840> +<00:03:39.050> 200<00:03:39.560> 24<00:03:39.890> which

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
kill it made it a 200 + 200 24 which

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.650 
kill it made it a 200 + 200 24 which
would<00:03:40.640> have<00:03:40.730> been<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:41.239> really<00:03:41.540> cool

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
would have been a really really cool

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.110 
would have been a really really cool
score<00:03:42.170> line<00:03:42.320> um<00:03:43.269> but<00:03:44.269> yeah<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.370> also<00:03:46.519> guys<00:03:46.820> uh

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
score line um but yeah and also guys uh

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.479 
score line um but yeah and also guys uh
we<00:03:47.570> just<00:03:47.870> roll<00:03:48.440> actually<00:03:48.830> two<00:03:48.950> days<00:03:49.070> ago<00:03:49.250> we

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
we just roll actually two days ago we

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.289 
we just roll actually two days ago we
had<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.970> video<00:03:50.450> arm<00:03:51.160> by<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.220> way<00:03:52.340> 110<00:03:52.880> kills<00:03:53.120> in

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
had a video arm by the way 110 kills in

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.060 
had a video arm by the way 110 kills in
one<00:03:53.330> round<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.230> we<00:03:54.290> had<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.440> video<00:03:54.590> about<00:03:54.860> two

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
one round but we had a video about two

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.759 
one round but we had a video about two
days<00:03:55.220> ago<00:03:55.400> where<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:55.820> posted<00:03:56.330> our<00:03:56.480> new<00:03:57.320> series

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
days ago where we posted our new series

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.270 
days ago where we posted our new series
the<00:03:58.070> top<00:03:58.280> 5<00:03:58.580> carnage<00:03:59.120> clips<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.720> week<00:03:59.959> and

the top 5 carnage clips of the week and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.380 
the top 5 carnage clips of the week and
we've<00:04:01.280> been<00:04:01.430> getting<00:04:01.549> some<00:04:01.700> missions<00:04:02.120> and

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099

sort of the way modern warfare 3
gameplay'<00:07:06.309> is<00:07:06.699> did<00:07:06.969> where<00:07:07.239> it's<00:07:07.779> just<00:07:07.839> gun

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139 
gameplay' is did where it's just gun

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.549 
gameplay' is did where it's just gun
kills<00:07:09.029> little<00:07:10.029> clips<00:07:10.329> that<00:07:10.509> just<00:07:10.899> curve<00:07:11.139> not

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:11.559

kills little clips that just curve not
clips<00:07:11.800> when<00:07:11.889> I<00:07:11.979> talk<00:07:12.189> about<00:07:12.219> the<00:07:12.459> new<00:07:12.610> clears

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:12.849 
clips when I talk about the new clears

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.659 
clips when I talk about the new clears
of<00:07:13.119> just<00:07:13.719> little<00:07:13.899> gameplays<00:07:14.289> of<00:07:14.669> going

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
of just little gameplays of going

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.269 
of just little gameplays of going
absolute<00:07:16.059> hand<00:07:16.419> with<00:07:16.689> your<00:07:16.869> gun<00:07:17.139> and<00:07:17.409> I<00:07:18.009> think

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:18.279 
absolute hand with your gun and I think

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.279 
absolute hand with your gun and I think
in<00:07:18.819> my<00:07:18.939> opinion<00:07:19.209> is<00:07:19.389> a<00:07:19.419> lot<00:07:19.719> more<00:07:19.929> interesting

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289 
in my opinion is a lot more interesting

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.689 
in my opinion is a lot more interesting
to<00:07:20.709> watch<00:07:22.229> gun<00:07:23.229> kills<00:07:23.559> than<00:07:24.279> it<00:07:24.399> is<00:07:24.519> kill

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
to watch gun kills than it is kill

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.509 
to watch gun kills than it is kill
streaks<00:07:24.939> of<00:07:25.029> course<00:07:25.529> and<00:07:26.529> that's<00:07:27.039> why<00:07:27.249> modern

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:27.519 
streaks of course and that's why modern
