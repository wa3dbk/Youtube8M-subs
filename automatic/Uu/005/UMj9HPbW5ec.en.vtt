through gizmodo com and uh there's a
video<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.930> showing<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.860> case<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
video actually showing the case like the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
video actually showing the case like the
front<00:00:42.149> part<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> case<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.350> action<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> uh

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
front part of the case in action and uh

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.639 
front part of the case in action and uh
and<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.440> does

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and as you can see right here it does

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.610 
and as you can see right here it does
have<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> camera<00:00:47.309> cut<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:49.170> mentioned

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
have a camera cut out and they mentioned

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
have a camera cut out and they mentioned
how<00:00:49.710> two<00:00:49.770> displays<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:51.000> bit

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
how two displays like a little bit

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.080 
how two displays like a little bit
darker<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:52.020> probably<00:00:52.530> indicates<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
darker which probably indicates that the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
darker which probably indicates that the
ipod<00:00:54.449> touch<00:00:54.480> 4th<00:00:54.989> generation<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.649> probably

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
ipod touch 4th generation is probably

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.959 
ipod touch 4th generation is probably
going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.520> Retina<00:00:56.879> display<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> if

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
new imacs they're coming out well

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
new imacs they're coming out well
they're<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.700> coming<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
they're not coming at all it's not like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
they're not coming at all it's not like
a<00:02:01.140> fern<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.920> did<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.509> patent<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a fern but they did put in a patent to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
a fern but they did put in a patent to
where<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> touch<00:02:06.570> screen<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:07.049> legs

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
where we can have a touch screen I legs

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.969 
where we can have a touch screen I legs
and<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.489> therefore<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.289> ones<00:02:10.530> percent

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and so therefore the like ones percent

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.320 
and so therefore the like ones percent
on<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> touchscreen<00:02:11.489> movement<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
on this touchscreen movement so that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
on this touchscreen movement so that
would<00:02:12.629> not<00:02:12.780> surprise<00:02:12.930> me

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
would not surprise me

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
would not surprise me
see<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.829> touchscreen<00:02:14.400> shuffle<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.840> let's<00:02:16.019> go

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
see a touchscreen shuffle but let's go

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.949

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
ahead and X out of that and probably

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.569 
ahead and X out of that and probably
will<00:02:19.230> see<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.569> apple<00:02:21.930> TV<00:02:22.110> maybe<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:23.400> not

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.659 
really don't see it happening but i'm
just<00:03:24.389> hoping<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.980> dreams<00:03:26.250> but

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669

just hoping we can all have dreams but
anyways<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:28.260> don't<00:03:28.769> like<00:03:28.889> them<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.159> use

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.030 
anyways I don't like them to use
actually<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.690> really<00:03:31.290> love<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.530> them<00:03:31.859> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
actually would really love for them to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.729 
actually would really love for them to
use<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.870> backing<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.650> on

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
use the kind of backing that you see on

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.500 
use the kind of backing that you see on
the<00:03:34.769> iphone<00:03:35.159> 4<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.760> we're<00:03:35.879> probably<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.299> even

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the iphone 4 but we're probably not even

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
the iphone 4 but we're probably not even
going<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.659> see<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:38.549> change<00:03:38.909> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
