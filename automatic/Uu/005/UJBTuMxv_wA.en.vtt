00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
gratification for doing something like

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.980 
gratification for doing something like
that<00:03:44.200> when<00:03:44.650> people<00:03:44.830> do<00:03:45.130> something<00:03:45.400> nice

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
that when people do something nice

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.880 
that when people do something nice
depends<00:03:46.990> on<00:03:47.110> who<00:03:47.260> they<00:03:47.410> are<00:03:47.440> but<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:47.770> usually

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
depends on who they are but they usually

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.770 
depends on who they are but they usually
expect<00:03:48.310> something<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:48.670> return<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.420> did<00:03:49.660> it

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
expect something in return and I did it

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.380 
expect something in return and I did it
completely<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.470> knowing<00:03:50.830> that<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.700> know<00:03:51.820> my

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
completely not knowing that you know my

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.450 
completely not knowing that you know my

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
but like I didn't I just wanted my

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.230 
but like I didn't I just wanted my
friend<00:03:57.040> Alan<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.610> have<00:03:57.820> some<00:03:58.000> toys<00:03:58.180> for
