triggered by certain food addictions and
an<00:00:43.200> example<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.800> would<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.360> cheese<00:00:45.360> for

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
an example of that would be cheese for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.569 
an example of that would be cheese for
example<00:00:46.050> cheese<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.739> somewhat<00:00:47.129> addictive

example cheese can be somewhat addictive

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
example cheese can be somewhat addictive
due<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.360> fact<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.930> produce

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
due to the fact that it can produce

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.740 
due to the fact that it can produce
queso<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.739> things<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.390> binds<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
queso more things which binds to the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.479 
queso more things which binds to the
receptors<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> brain<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.800> opians<00:00:53.219> do

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
receptors in the brain that opians do

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.110 
receptors in the brain that opians do
and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.840> mildly<00:00:55.530> addictive<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and so it can be mildly addictive so you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
and so it can be mildly addictive so you
have<00:00:57.420> foods<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.199> addictive<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
have foods that can be addictive in that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.580 
have foods that can be addictive in that
sense<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.579> crave<00:00:59.820> them<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
sense and so you'll crave them now that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
sense and so you'll crave them now that
can<00:01:01.980> indicate<00:01:02.430> vitamin<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.270> mineral

deficiencies<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.309> end<00:01:05.489> up

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
deficiencies and the what will end up

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.679

next<00:01:55.950> question<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.610> doing<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.210> exercise<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
next question is doing one exercise for

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
next question is doing one exercise for
biceps<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> triceps<00:01:58.799> three<00:01:59.340> times<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.700> week

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
biceps and triceps three times a week

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.050 
biceps and triceps three times a week
enough<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> grow<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> achieve<00:02:00.930> big<00:02:01.439> arms

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
enough to grow and achieve big arms

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
enough to grow and achieve big arms
short<00:02:03.060> answer<00:02:03.479> probably<00:02:03.840> particularly<00:02:04.829> if

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
short answer probably particularly if

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
short answer probably particularly if
you're<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.189> doing<00:02:05.490> compounds<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.270> these<00:02:06.390> if

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you're also doing compounds for these if

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.430 
you're also doing compounds for these if
you're<00:02:06.719> also<00:02:06.899> doing<00:02:08.330> rows<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.690> chin<00:02:09.929> ups<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you're also doing rows or chin ups and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
you're also doing rows or chin ups and
you're<00:02:10.530> doing<00:02:10.709> overhead<00:02:11.489> pressing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
you're doing overhead pressing

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.660 
you're doing overhead pressing
and<00:02:12.330> chest<00:02:12.930> pressing<00:02:13.440> biceps<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.550> triceps

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and chest pressing biceps and triceps

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.890 
and chest pressing biceps and triceps
are<00:02:14.970> getting<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.269> decent<00:02:15.450> amount<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
are getting a decent amount of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.300 
are getting a decent amount of
stimulation<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.129> you're<00:02:17.280> doing

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
stimulation and then what you're doing

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.920 
stimulation and then what you're doing
with<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> arm<00:02:17.849> work<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.239> you're<00:02:18.420> coming<00:02:18.810> in

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
with the arm work is you're coming in

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
with the arm work is you're coming in
and<00:02:18.959> you're<00:02:19.110> finishing<00:02:19.470> them<00:02:19.709> off<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.190> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
and you're finishing them off and it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.490 
and you're finishing them off and it
shouldn't<00:02:21.000> take<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.629> lot<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.959> work<00:02:22.230> because

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
shouldn't take you a lot of work because

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.290 
shouldn't take you a lot of work because
the<00:02:23.040> biceps<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.519> triceps<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> decent

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the biceps and triceps get a decent

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.059 
the biceps and triceps get a decent
amount<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> work<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.230> big<00:02:25.379> compounds

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
amount of work on your big compounds

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.670 
amount of work on your big compounds
they<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.060> relatively<00:02:27.720> small<00:02:28.080> muscles<00:02:28.500> they

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
they are relatively small muscles they

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.350 
they are relatively small muscles they
don't<00:02:28.860> need<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> lot<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.640> direct<00:02:29.970> stimulation

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
don't need a lot of direct stimulation

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
don't need a lot of direct stimulation
and<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.650> high<00:02:31.860> frequency<00:02:32.549> is<00:02:32.640> actually

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and that high frequency is actually

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000 
and that high frequency is actually
worth<00:02:33.269> more<00:02:33.629> than<00:02:33.810> doing<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> higher<00:02:34.349> volume<00:02:34.620> so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
worth more than doing a higher volume so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.920 
worth more than doing a higher volume so
yeah<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.400> very<00:02:35.610> possible<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.569> long<00:02:36.780> as

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
yeah it is very possible as long as

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.539 
yeah it is very possible as long as
you've<00:02:37.080> picked<00:02:37.349> off<00:02:37.500> fishing<00:02:37.739> movements<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
you've picked off fishing movements to

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.210 
you've picked off fishing movements to
go<00:02:38.730> ahead<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> come<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.299> do<00:02:39.390> 1<00:02:39.629> set<00:02:39.930> 3<00:02:40.170> times<00:02:41.099> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
go ahead and come and do 1 set 3 times a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.979 
go ahead and come and do 1 set 3 times a
week<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.400> each<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.910> go<00:02:42.030> ahead<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.450> stimulate

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
week for each and go ahead and stimulate

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.199 
week for each and go ahead and stimulate
adequate<00:02:43.530> growth<00:02:43.769> if<00:02:43.980> you're<00:02:44.549> really<00:02:44.790> worried

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
adequate growth if you're really worried

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
adequate growth if you're really worried
about<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.079> are<00:02:46.440> concerned<00:02:46.829> it's<00:02:47.099> not

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
about it and you are concerned it's not

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.880 
about it and you are concerned it's not
enough<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:48.599> two<00:02:48.870> sets<00:02:49.280> alright<00:02:50.280> next<00:02:50.459> question

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
enough do two sets alright next question

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.620 
enough do two sets alright next question
how<00:02:52.890> much<00:02:53.040> higher<00:02:53.610> do<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:53.940> feel<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> natural

that range aren't on drugs because not
