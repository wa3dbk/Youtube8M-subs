look at a caddis or a midge what you'll
see<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.280> they're<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.330> tube<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
see is that it's they're just a tube and

see is that it's they're just a tube and
that's<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.290> represents<00:00:16.529> from

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that's what this represents from

just short find your here so the thread
I'm<00:00:35.640> using<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.150> Danville

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I'm using is a Danville

I'm using is a Danville
six<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.220> nylon<00:00:38.700> threads<00:00:39.060> for

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
six up I like these nylon threads for

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.450 
six up I like these nylon threads for
smaller<00:00:40.170> stuff<00:00:40.560> because<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.100> stretch<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
smaller stuff because they stretch a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.620 
smaller stuff because they stretch a
little<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:42.980> most<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.130> the<00:00:44.190> flight<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.880> use<00:00:46.340> GSP

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
little bit most of the flight I use GSP

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.060 
little bit most of the flight I use GSP
but<00:00:48.630> it<00:00:48.750> doesn't<00:00:49.110> stretch<00:00:49.380> it's<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:49.980> easy

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but it doesn't stretch it's not as easy

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
but it doesn't stretch it's not as easy
to<00:00:50.250> anchor<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.540> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> start<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.079> with

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to anchor so I'm going to start out with

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.620 
to anchor so I'm going to start out with
just<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.770> thin<00:00:55.520> abdomen<00:00:56.520> I'm<00:00:57.420> using

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
just a really thin abdomen I'm using

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
this fly just like with the caddis is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.430 
this fly just like with the caddis is
tied<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.960> thirds<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.240> third<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:12.440> half

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.280 
tied in thirds the back third is a half
it<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> half<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> abdomen<00:01:18.229> getting<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

there when you look at one and if I'm
doing<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.960> cluster<00:01:58.729> what<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> saw<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.659> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
doing a cluster what I saw is with this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719 
doing a cluster what I saw is with this
flies<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.680> cluster<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.549> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
flies if you do a cluster you can just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300 
flies if you do a cluster you can just
do<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:04.080> four<00:02:04.380> strands<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.009> doing<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
do I use four strands if I'm doing a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880 
do I use four strands if I'm doing a
single<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.330> just<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> dull<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.680> use

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
single and just one a dull I just use

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.999 
single and just one a dull I just use
two<00:02:08.640> strands<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.229> cluster<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> leave<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
two strands if it's a cluster I leave a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
two strands if it's a cluster I leave a
few<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.609> a<00:02:11.849> little<00:02:12.510> bit<00:02:12.629> further<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
few more a little bit further back

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.709 
few more a little bit further back
because<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.829> looks<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:15.510> they're

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
because it looks like when they're

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.809 
because it looks like when they're
mating<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.829> what<00:02:17.069> you're<00:02:17.219> seeing<00:02:17.430> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
mating that's what you're seeing is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.869 
mating that's what you're seeing is
you're<00:02:18.300> seeing<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.750> single<00:02:19.050> female<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:20.580> three

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
you're seeing a single female with three

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.960 
you're seeing a single female with three
or<00:02:20.970> four<00:02:21.209> males<00:02:21.650> jumping<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.830> her<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.190> that's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
or four males jumping on her and that's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.720 
or four males jumping on her and that's
that<00:02:24.269> rolling<00:02:24.810> cluster<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that rolling cluster that you see and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
that rolling cluster that you see and
all<00:02:27.330> your<00:02:27.510> scenes<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.860> get

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
all your scenes you know you just get

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.410 
all your scenes you know you just get
more<00:02:29.099> reflection<00:02:29.640> you've<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:29.909> more<00:02:30.120> wings

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
more reflection you've got more wings

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.130 
more reflection you've got more wings
and<00:02:30.750> you've<00:02:31.440> got<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:31.950> body<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.090> hence<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and you've got more body so hence the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
and you've got more body so hence the
cluster<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.670> build<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
cluster so you just build it up you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.670 
cluster so you just build it up you
don't<00:02:36.569> have<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:37.049> anything<00:02:37.260> other<00:02:37.560> than

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
don't have to do anything other than

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.000 
don't have to do anything other than
make<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.180> bit<00:02:39.390> bigger<00:02:39.540> wing<00:02:39.900> now<00:02:40.890> I'm

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
make a little bit bigger wing now I'm

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.990 
make a little bit bigger wing now I'm
going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> stack<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.760> short<00:02:42.599> find<00:02:42.840> deer<00:02:43.080> here

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
going to stack this short find deer here

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.270 
going to stack this short find deer here
and<00:02:45.079> we're<00:02:46.079> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> measure<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:47.010> so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and we're going to measure this up so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.850 
and we're going to measure this up so
it's<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.610> slightly<00:02:48.000> longer<00:02:48.480> than<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
it's just slightly longer than that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.699 
it's just slightly longer than that
actual<00:02:50.660> then<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> under<00:02:52.799> wing<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.129> mean<00:02:54.709> we're

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
actual then the under wing I mean we're

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.670 
actual then the under wing I mean we're
going<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> set<00:02:56.129> this<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.609> here<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.410> nice

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
going to set this in here so it's nice

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.280 
going to set this in here so it's nice
and<00:02:58.709> tight<00:02:59.010> we're<00:02:59.579> going<00:02:59.609> to<00:02:59.760> give<00:02:59.849> it<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.290> two

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and tight we're going to give it one two

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.369 
and tight we're going to give it one two
pulls<00:03:01.680> not<00:03:02.400> letting<00:03:02.819> go<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.810> worked<00:03:04.079> right

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
pulls not letting go and worked right

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.020 
pulls not letting go and worked right
through<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.160> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> come<00:03:05.549> forward<00:03:06.000> now

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
through it I'm going to come forward now

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.050 
through it I'm going to come forward now
and<00:03:06.650> there's<00:03:07.650> my<00:03:07.829> little<00:03:08.010> wing<00:03:08.569> I'm<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:10.590> to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
and there's my little wing I'm going to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.759 
and there's my little wing I'm going to
if<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> notice<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.599> came<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.440> front

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
if you notice I came up to the front

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.800 
if you notice I came up to the front
third<00:03:14.069> now<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:15.209> I'm<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.569> back

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
third now because I'm going to go back

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.280 
third now because I'm going to go back
over<00:03:16.109> top<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.609> wing<00:03:17.819> butts<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.629> come

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
over top of the the wing butts and come

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.610 
over top of the the wing butts and come
back<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.799> make<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.129> body<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:22.290> trying<00:03:22.560> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
back to make the body just trying to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
back to make the body just trying to
keep<00:03:22.769> them<00:03:22.950> relatively<00:03:23.760> close<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.540> same

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
keep them relatively close to the same

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.979 
keep them relatively close to the same
size<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.519> abdomen<00:03:26.730> behind<00:03:27.720> because<00:03:27.900> this

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
size as the abdomen behind because this

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.379 
size as the abdomen behind because this
is<00:03:28.049> really<00:03:28.319> all<00:03:28.500> abdomen<00:03:29.099> just<00:03:29.849> we're<00:03:30.120> putting

is really all abdomen just we're putting

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.659 
is really all abdomen just we're putting
the<00:03:30.480> wing<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.870> because<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.069> fish<00:03:32.340> sees

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
the wing in because what the fish sees

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.819 
the wing in because what the fish sees
on<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:34.190> you're<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.280> hair<00:03:35.519> trapped<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.120> there

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
on this you're the hair trapped in there

on this you're the hair trapped in there
what<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.980> fish<00:03:38.220> sees<00:03:38.489> from<00:03:38.880> underneath<00:03:39.209> is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
what the fish sees from underneath is

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.409 
what the fish sees from underneath is
just<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.889> tips<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.579> wings<00:03:41.609> sticking

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
just this the tips of the wings sticking

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.890 
just this the tips of the wings sticking
back<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:45.060> we're<00:03:45.239> going<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.480> do<00:03:45.690> is

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
just show the tips of the wing from

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.360

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
is size 18 on a hackle gauge this hackle

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.490 
is size 18 on a hackle gauge this hackle
might<00:04:20.099> look<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.320> 16<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.530> 14<00:04:23.190> that's<00:04:23.490> fine

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
might look like a 16 or a 14 that's fine

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.690 
might look like a 16 or a 14 that's fine
especially<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> mids<00:04:25.890> there's<00:04:26.159> a<00:04:26.219> lot<00:04:26.520> of
