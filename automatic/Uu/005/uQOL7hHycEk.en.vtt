00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.650
 welcome to gone in life here os 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.600
 I bring another video guys and this time 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.430
 I bring a video to tell you about 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 ideas that I have of a possible new 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.509
 section because I say possible depending 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.039
 The support we have will make it or not 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.749
 say if you do not like it we will not do it 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.539
 so simply if it seems like a 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.640
 good section a good idea to leave a few 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.859
 likes a few comments additional ideas 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.630
 that a positive comment may arise 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.070
 if you want us to start now and all that 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.020
 Kind of things are worth I'll go 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.370
 commenting on how the whole subject of 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.140
 this new series as you will have seen in 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.060
 the title of the video the new section will 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.290
 You will call the netherworld and what is this 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.780
 Well, it's just going to be a world of 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 subs that is something that many subscribers 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.950
 they were already commenting that they wanted what 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 let's do it is a super flat world in 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.760
 the one that seven subscribers and I 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560
 weekly we will be building 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.870
 any type of construction to what I 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.260
 I mean, one can make a castle 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 a villa one pixel each in each 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.130
 chapter will choose what you want to build 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.320
 let's say that we will make a world among all 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.879
 it was quite fun I think how is it going to 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.979
 go the theme of the chapters so very 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.550
 simple guys once a week is going to 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.920
 have a line 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.110
 an additional live stream in which 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.180
 I will invite those seven subscribers who 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.160
 have been chosen weekly for 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.750
 participate in the underworld and we're going to 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.460
 be building, I'll be watching a 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.440
 little bit how are they building 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.540
 subscribers who are doing if they 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.460
 I can help and also build it 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.870
 additional things we will answer 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.910
 questions and answers as we do in 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.920
 all live and good everything 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.380
 that arises during the live but it will be 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 a special live for the underworld 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 surely you are wondering 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.470
 how will the issue of participation go 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.970
 every week I will release a video summary of 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.530
 how are the constructions of the underworld 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.460
 that is, showing a little everything 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.560
 that have been building the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 subscribers and in that video you will have to 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.620
 leave a comment with your 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 gamertag if a reason why 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.370
 you should be in the next episode 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.800
 the reason does not matter what it may be 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.720
 chorra can be funny no matter what 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.870
 Comments and subscribers will choose 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.940
 at random and every week they will rotate the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.070
 subscribers if you have already participated in 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.930
 this section you can not do it anymore to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 so many more can participate 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.200
 subscribers I think it's a great idea 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.090
 when the section progresses and you 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.010
 we have enough constructions yes that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.659
 I would like to share 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.730
 downloadable from the map so that all the 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.500
 let's say you can have a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.390
 version of your map on your console to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.010
 be able to see the constructions more 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.090
 quietly build from it 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.250
 good and that decision of each one is worth 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.290
 these are the main ideas that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 I have for this new section I hope that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 I liked it equally if you want 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.360
 add anything you already know 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.970
 you can leave it in the comments that yes 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.560
 I'll tell you if you like the section if 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.750
 You want me to go ahead, leave some 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.790
 likes that help me a lot to know if 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.769
 you will like it you will not like it and everything 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.290
 that kind of thing and I will tell you what 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.599
 always just leave a like if 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.889
 you liked psuv for more videos and nothing 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.109
 I hope that soon we will see each other in new 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.109
 videos a saludito and see you later
