00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
a individual coffee boiler at each group

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.990 
a individual coffee boiler at each group
head<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:27.920> really<00:00:28.220> their<00:00:28.369> first<00:00:28.640> foray

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
head so it's really their first foray

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.229 
head so it's really their first foray
into<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:30.439> third<00:00:30.769> wave<00:00:30.949> coffee<00:00:31.239> temperature

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239

into the third wave coffee temperature
profiling<00:00:32.839> machines<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:33.739> actually<00:00:34.010> a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
profiling machines and it's actually a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.410 
profiling machines and it's actually a
really<00:00:34.400> cool<00:00:34.610> machine<00:00:34.760> they've<00:00:35.120> done<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.330> lot

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
really cool machine they've done a lot

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.259 
really cool machine they've done a lot
of<00:00:35.629> work<00:00:35.750> on<00:00:35.900> it<00:00:36.050> really<00:00:36.470> make<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.650> nice<00:00:37.269> what

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
of work on it really make it nice what

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.640 
of work on it really make it nice what
they've<00:00:38.449> done<00:00:38.720> on<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:38.900> machine<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:39.500> you've

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
they've done on this machine so you've

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.710 
they've done on this machine so you've
got<00:00:39.830> your<00:00:40.010> normal<00:00:40.129> stuff<00:00:40.519> inside<00:00:40.790> sixteen

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
got your normal stuff inside sixteen

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.119 
got your normal stuff inside sixteen
little<00:00:41.960> boiler<00:00:42.199> that's<00:00:42.379> in<00:00:42.530> there<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:42.890> still

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
little boiler that's in there it's still

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.399 
little boiler that's in there it's still
gonna<00:00:43.250> do<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.489> heat<00:00:43.790> exchange<00:00:44.299> to<00:00:44.780> actually<00:00:45.170> put

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
gonna do a heat exchange to actually put

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.229 
gonna do a heat exchange to actually put
the<00:00:45.559> water<00:00:45.830> up<00:00:46.070> into<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.519> coffee<00:00:46.760> boiler

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
the water up into the coffee boiler

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.270 
the water up into the coffee boiler
they've<00:00:47.809> put<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:48.199> in<00:00:48.290> though<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.379> very<00:00:48.739> micro

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
they've put it in though a very micro

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.710 
they've put it in though a very micro
coffee<00:00:49.519> boiler<00:00:49.909> so<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.150> really<00:00:50.449> really

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
coffee boiler so it's really really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.329 
coffee boiler so it's really really
small<00:00:51.229> and<00:00:51.500> they're<00:00:51.650> calling<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.070> just<00:00:52.190> a

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
small and they're calling it just a

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.520 
small and they're calling it just a
finishing<00:00:52.670> boiler<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.629> concept<00:00:54.080> behind<00:00:54.199> it

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
finishing boiler the concept behind it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.170 
finishing boiler the concept behind it
is<00:00:54.650> we<00:00:54.769> want<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.010> interject<00:00:55.190> water<00:00:55.729> up<00:00:56.000> there

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
is we want to interject water up there

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.810 
is we want to interject water up there
roughly<00:00:56.720> about<00:00:56.809> 190<00:00:57.619> degrees<00:00:57.920> or<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.400> then

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
roughly about 190 degrees or so and then

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.789 
roughly about 190 degrees or so and then
we're<00:00:58.939> gonna<00:00:59.030> use<00:00:59.119> a<00:00:59.360> 250<00:01:00.260> watt<00:01:00.379> heating

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
we're gonna use a 250 watt heating

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.130 
we're gonna use a 250 watt heating
element<00:01:01.129> inside<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.699> there<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.239> change<00:01:02.720> that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
element inside of there to change that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.539 
element inside of there to change that
temperature<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:03.860> whether<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:04.189> need<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.400> bring

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
temperature so whether we need to bring

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.390 
temperature so whether we need to bring
it<00:01:04.670> up<00:01:04.909> whether<00:01:05.360> we<00:01:05.510> need<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.720> flatten<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.229> out

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
it up whether we need to flatten it out

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.649 
it up whether we need to flatten it out
what<00:01:07.400> they've<00:01:07.610> done<00:01:07.970> actually<00:01:08.270> that's

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
what they've done actually that's

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.749 
what they've done actually that's
different<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:09.560> machine<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:10.250> run<00:01:10.490> a

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
different on this machine is they run a

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.120 
different on this machine is they run a
cold<00:01:11.179> water<00:01:11.420> source<00:01:11.869> into<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:12.679> boiler<00:01:13.009> as

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
cold water source into that boiler as

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.370 
cold water source into that boiler as
well<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:13.939> now<00:01:14.149> what<00:01:14.359> this<00:01:14.479> allows<00:01:14.750> us<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:15.079> do<00:01:15.229> is

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
well so now what this allows us to do is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.499 
well so now what this allows us to do is
actually<00:01:15.590> bend<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.130> temperature<00:01:16.579> up<00:01:16.759> or<00:01:17.060> down

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
actually bend the temperature up or down

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.889 
actually bend the temperature up or down
if<00:01:17.840> we<00:01:18.289> have<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.100> boiler<00:01:19.490> temperature<00:01:19.670> at<00:01:20.149> 203

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
if we have the boiler temperature at 203

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.239 
if we have the boiler temperature at 203
degrees<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.439> we<00:01:21.499> want<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.799> bring<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.100> to

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
degrees and we want to bring it down to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.080 
degrees and we want to bring it down to
198<00:01:23.119> throughout<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.840> process<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.560> that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
198 throughout the process of that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.399 
198 throughout the process of that
extraction<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:26.689> can<00:01:26.840> actually<00:01:26.960> interject

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
extraction we can actually interject

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.080 
extraction we can actually interject
cold<00:01:27.619> water<00:01:27.859> into<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.340> accomplish<00:01:28.909> that

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
cold water into it and accomplish that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.489 
cold water into it and accomplish that
where's<00:01:29.329> you're<00:01:29.479> not<00:01:29.630> gonna<00:01:29.780> see<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.079> in<00:01:30.350> any

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
where's you're not gonna see that in any

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.520 
where's you're not gonna see that in any
other<00:01:30.590> machine<00:01:31.299> as<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.570> goes<00:01:32.749> basically<00:01:32.990> each

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
other machine as it goes basically each

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.959 
other machine as it goes basically each
group<00:01:33.829> head<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.399> two<00:01:34.549> group<00:01:34.700> machine

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
group head if it's a two group machine

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.429 
group head if it's a two group machine
three<00:01:35.270> group<00:01:35.450> or<00:01:35.600> four<00:01:35.810> group<00:01:35.960> would<00:01:36.140> have<00:01:36.170> its

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
three group or four group would have its

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.559 
three group or four group would have its
own<00:01:36.560> individual<00:01:37.100> boiler<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.700> each<00:01:38.149> one<00:01:38.450> would

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
own individual boiler and each one would

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.429 
own individual boiler and each one would
be<00:01:38.689> 250<00:01:39.439> Watts<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> basically<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:42.200> little

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
be 250 Watts so basically this little

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
button right here is really what makes

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.090 
button right here is really what makes
it<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.869> excel<00:01:45.200> seus<00:01:45.469> if<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.710> took<00:01:45.859> that<00:01:46.039> away

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
it the excel seus if you took that away

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.830 
it the excel seus if you took that away
this<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.850> what<00:01:46.999> a<00:01:47.030> class<00:01:47.240> nine<00:01:47.509> would<00:01:47.689> look

this is what a class nine would look

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.899 
this is what a class nine would look
like<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.439> add<00:01:48.619> this<00:01:48.889> in<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.369> now<00:01:49.549> we<00:01:49.609> have<00:01:49.789> the

there's<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.580> couple<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.970> different<00:02:43.240> profiles

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
there's a couple of different profiles

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240 
there's a couple of different profiles
this<00:02:43.900> allows<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.860> gets<00:02:45.100> back

coming in you're able to do what's
called<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.120> flat<00:02:49.390> profile<00:02:49.840> which<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.350> that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
called a flat profile which all that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.660 
called a flat profile which all that
means<00:02:50.710> is<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:53.500> temperature<00:02:54.190> so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
means is I just have one temperature so

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.790 
means is I just have one temperature so
start<00:02:54.880> temperature<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.330> 200<00:02:55.840> finishing

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.290 
start temperature of 200 finishing
temperature<00:02:57.130> would<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.430> 200<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.150> not

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
temperature would be 200 it's not

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.080 
temperature would be 200 it's not
available<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:58.990> now<00:02:59.770> if<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.280> want<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.580> profile

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
available to do now if I want to profile

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.940 
available to do now if I want to profile
it<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.720> click<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.650> see<00:03:02.800> my

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it I can click on this and I can see my

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.580 
it I can click on this and I can see my
options<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.520> that's<00:03:03.700> flat<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:05.020> profile<00:03:05.380> up

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
options so that's flat I can profile up

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.890 
options so that's flat I can profile up
or<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.550> profile<00:03:07.000> down<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.600> what<00:03:07.720> that

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
or I can profile down and what that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.840 
or I can profile down and what that
basically<00:03:08.080> means<00:03:08.500> let's<00:03:09.220> say<00:03:09.370> I'm<00:03:09.459> starting

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
basically means let's say I'm starting

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.180 
basically means let's say I'm starting
at<00:03:09.940> 200<00:03:10.390> degrees<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.930> throughout<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.770> 30

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
at 200 degrees and throughout that 30

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.070 
at 200 degrees and throughout that 30
second<00:03:12.520> extraction<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.209> want<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.510> finish<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.840> at

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
second extraction I want to finish it at

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.610 
second extraction I want to finish it at
198<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.040> would<00:03:15.490> profile<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.090> down<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.900> 200<00:03:17.470> to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
198 I would profile it down so 200 to

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.130 
198 I would profile it down so 200 to
198<00:03:18.190> flip<00:03:19.060> side<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.840> wanted<00:03:20.050> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
198 flip side of that is if I wanted to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.900 
198 flip side of that is if I wanted to
increase<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.920> temperature<00:03:20.950> let's<00:03:21.700> say<00:03:21.820> I'm

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
increase in temperature let's say I'm

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.850 
increase in temperature let's say I'm
starting<00:03:22.269> at<00:03:22.360> 198<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.140> want<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.440> finish<00:03:23.680> at

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
starting at 198 and I want to finish at

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.240 
starting at 198 and I want to finish at
203<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.820> would<00:03:25.269> profile<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.810> up<00:03:26.019> from<00:03:26.440> 198<00:03:26.980> to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
203 I would profile that up from 198 to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.420 
203 I would profile that up from 198 to
203<00:03:28.620> basically<00:03:29.620> all<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.160> do<00:03:30.310> is

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
203 basically all you have to do is

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.040 
203 basically all you have to do is
let's<00:03:30.850> go<00:03:31.000> ahead<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.209> select<00:03:31.330> up<00:03:31.630> real<00:03:31.870> quick

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
let's go ahead and select up real quick

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.430 
let's go ahead and select up real quick
hit<00:03:32.590> enter<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.239> can<00:03:34.450> go<00:03:34.540> back<00:03:34.570> start

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
hit enter now I can go back start

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.550 
hit enter now I can go back start
temperature<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.070> want<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.400> take<00:03:36.550> that<00:03:36.730> down

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
temperature I want to take that down

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430 
temperature I want to take that down
let's<00:03:38.560> take<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.800> down<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.010> 198<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:41.200> now<00:03:41.290> we're

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
let's take it down to 198 so now we're

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.259 
let's take it down to 198 so now we're
at<00:03:41.500> 198<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.250> there<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:42.940> see<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
at 198 right there and you can see the

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.610 
at 198 right there and you can see the
temperature<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:43.959> would<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:44.410> my

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
temperature to which would be my

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.000 
temperature to which would be my
finishing<00:03:44.980> temperature<00:03:45.550> if<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.360> hit<00:03:46.510> ok<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.110> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
finishing temperature if I hit ok now I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.970 
finishing temperature if I hit ok now I
go<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> final<00:03:49.180> temperature<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.590> we're<00:03:50.860> gonna

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
go to final temperature and we're gonna

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.050 
go to final temperature and we're gonna
take<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.610> up<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.300> 2<00:03:53.230> or<00:03:53.380> 3<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.640> what<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.910> is

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
take that up to 2 or 3 so what this is

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.150 
take that up to 2 or 3 so what this is
telling<00:03:55.090> me<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.570> my<00:03:55.810> shot<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.200> gonna<00:03:56.620> start<00:03:57.010> its

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
telling me is my shot is gonna start its

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.759 
telling me is my shot is gonna start its
extraction<00:03:57.600> 198<00:03:58.600> degrees<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:59.440> gonna<00:03:59.530> end

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
extraction 198 degrees it's gonna end

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.370 
extraction 198 degrees it's gonna end
its<00:03:59.980> extraction<00:04:00.519> at<00:04:00.640> 203<00:04:01.420> degrees<00:04:01.540> if<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.230> hit

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
its extraction at 203 degrees if I hit

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.380 
its extraction at 203 degrees if I hit
that<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.950> takes<00:04:03.160> me<00:04:03.340> out<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.730> couple<00:04:04.209> times

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
that that takes me out a couple times

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.140 
that that takes me out a couple times
for<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.870> takes<00:04:05.380> me<00:04:05.560> right<00:04:05.590> back<00:04:05.940> what's<00:04:06.940> nice

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
for that takes me right back what's nice

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.729 
for that takes me right back what's nice
about<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.570> machine<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.930> if<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.290> forget

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
about this machine is if you forget

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.350 
about this machine is if you forget
where<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.130> at<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.700> don't<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.120> get<00:04:10.239> into

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
where it's at you don't have to get into

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.000 
where it's at you don't have to get into
that<00:04:10.420> whole<00:04:10.630> programming<00:04:11.110> mode<00:04:11.380> if<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.860> just

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
that whole programming mode if you just

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.940 
that whole programming mode if you just
hold<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.430> about<00:04:12.730> 3<00:04:13.030> seconds<00:04:13.769> you'll<00:04:14.769> see

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
hold this for about 3 seconds you'll see

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.710 
hold this for about 3 seconds you'll see
this<00:04:15.130> pop<00:04:15.400> up<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.209> see<00:04:16.570> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
this pop up and you can see the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.900 
this pop up and you can see the
temperature<00:04:17.169> inside<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.799> boiler<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.250> what

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
temperature inside that boiler and what

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.430 
temperature inside that boiler and what
it's<00:04:19.060> doing<00:04:19.269> if<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.810> look<00:04:20.019> right<00:04:20.169> there

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
it's doing if you look right there

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320 
it's doing if you look right there
there's<00:04:20.650> an<00:04:20.799> up<00:04:20.979> arrow<00:04:21.220> next<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.640> group<00:04:21.880> 1<00:04:22.120> and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
there's an up arrow next to group 1 and

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.710 
there's an up arrow next to group 1 and
a<00:04:22.570> down<00:04:22.840> arrow<00:04:22.870> next<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.530> group<00:04:23.770> 2<00:04:24.540> goes<00:04:25.540> away

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
a down arrow next to group 2 goes away

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.120 
a down arrow next to group 2 goes away
in<00:04:25.780> about<00:04:25.870> five<00:04:26.200> or<00:04:26.380> six<00:04:26.500> seconds<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.039> you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
in about five or six seconds so you

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.800 
in about five or six seconds so you
gotta<00:04:27.280> have<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.580> do<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.390> what<00:04:28.510> this<00:04:28.630> is

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
gotta have to do that but what this is

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.560 
gotta have to do that but what this is
telling<00:04:29.020> me<00:04:29.229> is<00:04:29.470> one<00:04:29.830> name

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
telling me is one name

telling me is one name
profiling<00:04:31.020> up<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.440> 203<00:04:31.770> this<00:04:32.700> one<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.000> 199<00:04:33.570> I'm

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
profiling up the 203 this one is 199 I'm

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.950 
profiling up the 203 this one is 199 I'm
sorry<00:04:34.800> 201<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:35.940> gonna<00:04:36.030> profile<00:04:36.540> down<00:04:36.780> to

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
sorry 201 and it's gonna profile down to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.380 
sorry 201 and it's gonna profile down to
199<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:38.370> way<00:04:38.520> if<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.700> ever<00:04:38.760> forget<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.300> you

199 that way if you ever forget it you

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.490 
199 that way if you ever forget it you
want<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.660> know<00:04:39.720> what's<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:40.140> on

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
want to know what's going on

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.050 
want to know what's going on
maybe<00:04:40.740> someone<00:04:41.100> changes<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:41.880> can

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
maybe someone changes on you you can

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
maybe someone changes on you you can
quickly<00:04:42.300> access<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:43.050> without<00:04:43.350> having<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.680> go

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
quickly access that without having to go

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.890 
quickly access that without having to go
into<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.010> full<00:04:44.250> menu<00:04:44.640> so<00:04:45.300> once<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:45.570> get<00:04:45.660> past

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.680 
sides as well it does come standard with
regular<00:06:08.220> steam<00:06:08.790> arms<00:06:09.030> on<00:06:09.210> there<00:06:09.390> but<00:06:09.540> they<00:06:09.630> do

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
regular steam arms on there but they do

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.690 
regular steam arms on there but they do
allow<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.170> option<00:06:10.410> to<00:06:10.770> upgrade<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.280> to<00:06:11.310> a<00:06:11.430> no

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
allow the option to upgrade it to a no

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.640 
allow the option to upgrade it to a no
burn<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.150> I<00:06:12.180> can<00:06:12.420> remove<00:06:12.660> this<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:12.960> not<00:06:13.470> burn

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
burn so I can remove this and not burn

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.190 
burn so I can remove this and not burn
myself<00:06:14.100> basically<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.750> then<00:06:15.930> other<00:06:16.110> than

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
myself basically and then other than

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.470 
myself basically and then other than
that<00:06:16.440> it's<00:06:16.920> your<00:06:17.070> standard<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:17.580> value<00:06:18.210> metric

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
that it's your standard I value metric

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.000 
that it's your standard I value metric
machine<00:06:18.810> I've<00:06:18.990> got<00:06:19.140> two<00:06:19.380> T<00:06:19.560> buttons<00:06:19.890> right

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
machine I've got two T buttons right

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.010 
machine I've got two T buttons right
over<00:06:20.220> here<00:06:20.400> for<00:06:20.610> hot<00:06:20.760> water<00:06:21.000> there<00:06:21.660> is<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.780> hot

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
over here for hot water there is a hot

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.720 
over here for hot water there is a hot
water<00:06:22.230> economizer<00:06:22.830> in<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.190> so<00:06:23.310> if<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.460> want<00:06:23.640> to

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
water economizer in it so if I want to

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.140 
water economizer in it so if I want to
set<00:06:23.970> that<00:06:24.120> temperature<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:25.070> whatever<00:06:26.070> 198<00:06:27.000> or

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
set that temperature to whatever 198 or

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.390 
set that temperature to whatever 198 or
200<00:06:27.540> degrees<00:06:27.840> I<00:06:28.050> can<00:06:28.440> actually<00:06:28.620> get<00:06:28.950> that<00:06:29.190> and

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
200 degrees I can actually get that and

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.100 
200 degrees I can actually get that and
that's<00:06:29.610> accomplished<00:06:30.240> by<00:06:30.330> putting<00:06:30.690> hot<00:06:30.900> and

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
that's accomplished by putting hot and

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.190 
that's accomplished by putting hot and
cold<00:06:31.350> water<00:06:31.410> again<00:06:32.010> in<00:06:32.250> here<00:06:33.030> if<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:33.990> want<00:06:34.140> to

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
cold water again in here if you want to

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.960 
cold water again in here if you want to
get<00:06:34.290> into<00:06:34.440> any<00:06:34.620> type<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.890> programming<00:06:35.610> on<00:06:35.760> this

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
get into any type of programming on this

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.990 
get into any type of programming on this
right<00:06:36.570> through<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:37.730> continuous<00:06:38.730> button

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
right through this continuous button

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.310 
right through this continuous button
basically<00:06:39.450> you're<00:06:39.570> gonna<00:06:39.630> hit<00:06:39.840> that<00:06:40.020> hold

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
basically you're gonna hit that hold

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.260 
basically you're gonna hit that hold
that<00:06:40.380> for<00:06:40.650> 10<00:06:40.830> seconds<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.640> that's<00:06:42.060> going<00:06:42.210> to

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
that for 10 seconds and that's going to

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.120 
that for 10 seconds and that's going to
take<00:06:42.450> me<00:06:42.660> into<00:06:43.020> my<00:06:43.170> volumetric<00:06:43.620> butt

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
take me into my volumetric butt

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.130 
take me into my volumetric butt
and<00:06:44.460> now<00:06:44.730> I<00:06:44.760> can<00:06:45.000> go<00:06:45.120> inside<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:45.750> actually

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
and now I can go inside and actually

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.750 
and now I can go inside and actually
program<00:06:46.740> anything<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:47.370> if<00:06:47.460> I<00:06:47.490> wanted<00:06:47.700> to

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
program anything so if I wanted to

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.920 
program anything so if I wanted to
change<00:06:48.060> this<00:06:48.270> right<00:06:48.510> there

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
change this right there

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.890 
change this right there
you're<00:06:49.380> gonna<00:06:49.500> see<00:06:49.680> that<00:06:49.710> count<00:06:50.100> going<00:06:50.430> up<00:06:50.900> hit

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
you're gonna see that count going up hit

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.990 
you're gonna see that count going up hit
it<00:06:51.930> it's<00:06:52.470> now<00:06:52.710> reprogrammed<00:06:53.430> for<00:06:53.850> that

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
it it's now reprogrammed for that

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.150 
it it's now reprogrammed for that
particular<00:06:54.540> volume<00:06:54.740> and<00:06:55.740> now<00:06:55.830> you'll<00:06:56.010> hit

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
particular volume and now you'll hit

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.350 
particular volume and now you'll hit
that<00:06:56.340> and<00:06:56.520> you'll<00:06:56.610> see<00:06:56.820> it's<00:06:56.940> just<00:06:57.000> gonna<00:06:57.240> run

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
that and you'll see it's just gonna run

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.180 
that and you'll see it's just gonna run
for<00:06:57.540> just<00:06:57.660> a<00:06:57.780> couple<00:06:57.960> seconds<00:06:58.410> and<00:06:58.800> kick<00:06:59.040> off

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
for just a couple seconds and kick off

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.650 
for just a couple seconds and kick off
like<00:06:59.430> that<00:07:00.350> this<00:07:01.350> is<00:07:01.560> really<00:07:01.890> meant<00:07:02.130> for<00:07:02.660> high
