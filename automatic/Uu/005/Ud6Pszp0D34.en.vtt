00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 we started with the stretch 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.430
 It is a track with a lot of plateau 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 pedant not very difficult but very 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.680
 three chairs here to a career sidewalk a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.870
 pretty hard stretch would have to be very 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.330
 Strong above all arms and hold 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.520
 a drop of almost zero degrees eight 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.900

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.790
 and tonight the night 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.410
 competition level but it was very fun 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.730
 one with an experience we have to 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.770

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.990

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.870

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.990

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.330
