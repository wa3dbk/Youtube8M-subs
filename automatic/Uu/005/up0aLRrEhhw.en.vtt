00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello how are you in the video and I bring 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.259
 something that hit me a long time ago and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.210
 it was if they were cooking things and or cooking 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 I do not know anything but I really like the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.960
 desserts and all those things then in 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 this video have two dessert landmarks that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 They are super easy to make and the material 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 main is the puff pastry that can 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
 get anywhere that he does not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 stopped the globe has super cheap if 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 are dieting I will not hate 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.970
 but it's super rich and it's very easy to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.949
 doing the same one day a week does not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.480
 damage we should not put finger up if 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.279
 they like this kind of videos and let me 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 in the comments you will like to see more 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.280
 videos and what they would like to see then 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 if you want to know how these are made 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.930
 Puff pastry cupcakes keeps watching and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.570
 see you in another video chao we are going to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.110
 need hazelnut cream with cocoa 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.590
 also natural honey bees because it is 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.739
 much better and apple scientists a 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.440
 roll these to knead flour from 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.690
 wheat and obviously the puff pastry 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 I recommend that you buy it because it's a 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 little maluco of rule 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 we are going to need a tray and paper 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 anxiety 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
 not the one that I bought came with this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.830
 plastic and I think it's super cool 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 because I do not have to anoint the table nor 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.479
 nothing but if you do not have what you should 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.550
 do is back a little flour 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 the surface where you are going to work and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.350
 equally also in the part where you're going 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.979
 to knead so that we are not going to stick 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.979
 the roller 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.780
 as poquitico in the hands it scatters 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 well for the whole mass 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 and so will put the roller 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.980
 that these are what we are going 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.750
 Explanation 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.370
 it's not going to be a little bit that the roller 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.370
 because for my taste it was very thick 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.619
 now he is going to cut a few squares and his 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 of the size that you want between more 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.240
 big make it bigger than your cake 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.679
 and now with help to listen I'm going to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.679
 put the cloth in half 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.319
 I pass a corner to the other side and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.719
 with my fingers I'm going to crush those edges 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.389
 so that it sticks much better with the help 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:17.209
 of a little water wet your fingers and 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.810
 I start crushing those two edges to 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.810
 stick 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.440
 you can roll them up to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.710
 inside to make sure very much 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.710
 best 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.610
 I pass it to the tray and with the help of 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.710
 a fork we are going to crush that part 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.710
 that we just folded 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.180
 and I'm going to make a few holes 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.180
 in the middle 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.950
 Well let's see a procedure 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.030
 it's super easy to do it does not delay 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.030
 nothing I swear 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.560
 next I'm going to cut my manzanita 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.210
 in half obviously they should wash it very 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.900
 well a knife will remove the part 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.900
 from the center 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.239
 and then how hitting a potato is going to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.790
 remove the whole house I'm super bad 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.079
 as you can see but to see that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.590
 they do not have to know about cooking to be able 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.590
 do this 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.819
 do not cut into slices and then in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.739
 small squares 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.629
 I'm going to provide other rectangles a 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.409
 slightly larger than the previous ones 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.409
 because the apple 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.060
 I was going to put some pieces in 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.420
 half 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.180
 I'm going to do like a little girl and then 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.890
 add honey the apple can 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 caramelize but I left it 50 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.850
 like this I can speak it in a triangle 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.050
 what they do is carry all the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.050
 corners passes half 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.780
 and then I'm going to pinch the edges with 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.600
 my fingers so that we do not leave 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.920
 come out nothing is going to wet my fingers 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.170
 I just take it to the tray and 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.820
 Nash then make little holes in there I have 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.940
 many more then I'll put it in a 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.730
 oven that pre-heated it to 180 degrees and 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.540
 lowered it from 30 to 45 minutes or until 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.730
 the dough is hard 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.760
 once past this time I'm going to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.560
 take out of the oven 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.420
 You want to make it a little more 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.480
 what they can do is put in 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.460
 the dough with a little butter or 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.070
 of egg yolk but I do it like that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.670
 for as to not give another flavor 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.660
 they must be hard and crispy and ready 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.660
 it's super easy 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.560
 two
