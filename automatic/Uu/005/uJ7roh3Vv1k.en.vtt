naturally would fill in some of these
guys<00:02:00.689> running<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.009> did<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> dry<00:02:02.430> run

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
guys running around and we did a dry run

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
guys running around and we did a dry run
first<00:02:03.119> shots<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.659> were<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> awesome

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
first shots we were like this is awesome

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.649 
first shots we were like this is awesome
all<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.450> up

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
all we do have to do is you know go up

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.180 
all we do have to do is you know go up
in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> back<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
in the back a little bit make that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
in the back a little bit make that
really<00:02:08.399> feel<00:02:08.700> dynamically<00:02:09.629> bright<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
really feel dynamically bright in the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.749 
really feel dynamically bright in the
back

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
back

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.610 
back
and<00:02:10.849> then<00:02:11.000> tailor<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> front<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.140> tad<00:02:12.590> bit

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and then tailor the front just a tad bit

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.270 
and then tailor the front just a tad bit
swear<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.159> felt<00:02:13.310> even<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.180> spotty<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:16.129> was<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
swear it felt even a not spotty it was a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770 
swear it felt even a not spotty it was a
tough<00:02:16.549> shoot<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.849> was<00:02:16.940> hard<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.659> we

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
tough shoot it was hard just to get we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.410 
tough shoot it was hard just to get we
did<00:02:17.989> probably<00:02:18.650> 12<00:02:19.010> runs<00:02:19.519> these<00:02:19.760> guys<00:02:19.970> doing<00:02:20.269> a

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
did probably 12 runs these guys doing a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.500 
did probably 12 runs these guys doing a
real<00:02:20.569> tire<00:02:20.989> change<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.040> needed<00:02:22.970> those<00:02:23.180> packs

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
real tire change so needed those packs

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.780 
real tire change so needed those packs
that<00:02:23.720> fast<00:02:24.049> recycle<00:02:24.560> time<00:02:24.739> good<00:02:25.549> flash

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
that fast recycle time good flash

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.460 
that fast recycle time good flash
duration<00:02:26.090> cuz<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.480> were<00:02:26.599> capturing<00:02:27.049> action

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
duration cuz we were capturing action

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440 
duration cuz we were capturing action
that<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:28.459> posed<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.150> mean<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.360> was

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that was not posed I mean it was

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.059 
that was not posed I mean it was
definitely<00:02:29.569> set<00:02:30.019> up<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.410> they<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.860> did

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
definitely set up but they really did

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.979
