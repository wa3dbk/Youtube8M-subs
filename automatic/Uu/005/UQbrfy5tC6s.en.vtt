process<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.050> Bungie<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.560> giving<00:03:09.920> us

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
process I like that Bungie is giving us

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.760 
process I like that Bungie is giving us
a<00:03:10.160> road<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.730> upgrade<00:03:11.210> our<00:03:11.420> old<00:03:11.930> exotics<00:03:12.620> to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
a road to upgrade our old exotics to

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.830 
a road to upgrade our old exotics to
keep<00:03:12.920> them<00:03:13.130> relevant<00:03:13.520> for<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.330> taken<00:03:14.660> King

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
keep them relevant for the taken King

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.200 
keep them relevant for the taken King
but<00:03:15.050> I'm<00:03:15.290> concerned<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.640> won't<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:17.000> all

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
but I'm concerned that it won't be all

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.470 
but I'm concerned that it won't be all
of<00:03:17.630> them<00:03:17.810> at<00:03:18.170> least<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.620> yet<00:03:19.330> rethinking<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
of them at least not yet rethinking the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.630 
of them at least not yet rethinking the
perks<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.170> exotics<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.830> certainly<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.400> good

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
perks on the exotics is certainly a good

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.700 
perks on the exotics is certainly a good
idea<00:03:22.970> considering<00:03:23.390> all<00:03:23.780> Bungie<00:03:24.260> has<00:03:24.410> learned

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
idea considering all Bungie has learned

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.370 
idea considering all Bungie has learned
over<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.490> past<00:03:25.520> year<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.690> hope<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
over the past year and I hope that the

over the past year and I hope that the
year<00:03:27.740> two<00:03:28.010> versions<00:03:28.580> will<00:03:28.760> offer<00:03:28.940> more

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
year two versions will offer more

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.890 
year two versions will offer more
balance<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.110> crucible<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.430> PvE<00:03:31.900> this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
balance in the crucible and in PvE this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.199 
balance in the crucible and in PvE this
one<00:03:33.110> may<00:03:33.530> turn<00:03:33.830> out<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:34.010> be<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> great<00:03:34.550> idea<00:03:34.760> that

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
one may turn out to be a great idea that

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.870 
one may turn out to be a great idea that
