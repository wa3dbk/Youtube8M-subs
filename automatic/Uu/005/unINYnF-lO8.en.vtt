00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
but once I did how much nicer it was

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
but once I did how much nicer it was

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it and just helped I mean you just you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
it and just helped I mean you just you
could<00:01:01.620> carry<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.340> belt<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
was less of a hassle and that was the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.640 
was less of a hassle and that was the
first<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.210> suspenders<00:01:06.840> or

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
first time I really had suspenders or

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
first time I really had suspenders or
the<00:01:07.799> only<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.220> I've<00:01:08.520> ever<00:01:08.549> used<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> spenders

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the only time I've ever used to spenders

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
the only time I've ever used to spenders
and<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:10.350> could<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:10.979> where<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> obvious

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and I could see where it was the obvious

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.679 
and I could see where it was the obvious
better<00:01:12.750> situation<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> tin

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
better situation so when I got the tin

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.109 
better situation so when I got the tin
pants<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.350> knew<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> might<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.580> suspenders

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
pants I knew that I might get suspenders

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.490 
pants I knew that I might get suspenders
but<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.390> wouldn't<00:01:18.659> sure<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.080> gonna<00:01:19.170> try<00:01:19.439> them

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
but I wouldn't sure I was gonna try them

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700 
but I wouldn't sure I was gonna try them
out<00:01:19.710> first<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:21.840> him<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
out first of all and when I got him I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.249 
out first of all and when I got him I
warm<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> few<00:01:23.939> days<00:01:24.060> without<00:01:24.210> without<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
warm for a few days without without the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
warm for a few days without without the
suspenders<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:27.000> okay<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.420> mean

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
suspenders and it was really okay I mean

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120 
suspenders and it was really okay I mean
I<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:28.290> definitely<00:01:28.680> feel<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:28.950> they're

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I didn't definitely feel like they're

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
I didn't definitely feel like they're
weighed<00:01:29.430> me<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.670> did

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
weighed me down so much but what did

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
weighed me down so much but what did
start<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> bother<00:01:33.869> me<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
start to kind of bother me and only a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
start to kind of bother me and only a
couple<00:01:34.860> times<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.610> probably<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.060> occasions

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
couple times and probably some occasions

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
couple times and probably some occasions
where<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> points<00:01:38.009> come<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
where the points come in for the for the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
where the points come in for the for the
suspenders<00:01:40.200> they'll<00:01:40.470> rub<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> side<00:01:42.060> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
suspenders they'll rub in to the side if

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.500 
suspenders they'll rub in to the side if
you<00:01:42.299> bend<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:42.990> catch<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> certain<00:01:43.619> way

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
you bend or catch it in a certain way

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.010 
you bend or catch it in a certain way
so<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.520> decided<00:01:46.940> I'd<00:01:47.090> tried<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> suspenders

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
so so I decided I'd tried the suspenders

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.630 
so so I decided I'd tried the suspenders
if<00:01:48.170> nothing<00:01:48.440> else<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.190> put<00:01:49.400> them<00:01:49.490> on

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
if nothing else so that I put them on

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.480 
if nothing else so that I put them on
and<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.900> takes<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.650> little<00:01:51.800> bit<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.220> takes<00:01:52.430> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and it takes a little bit of it takes a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.240 
and it takes a little bit of it takes a
few<00:01:52.640> days<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.820> get<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.360> adjustment<00:01:54.250> there's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
few days to get to adjustment there's

there's better air flow because that air

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.010 
there's better air flow because that air
flow<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.850> makes<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.390> tremendous<00:03:41.570> difference<00:03:42.040> I

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
flow it makes a tremendous difference I

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.430 
flow it makes a tremendous difference I
was<00:03:45.020> amazed<00:03:45.290> really<00:03:45.739> pretty<00:03:46.040> shocked<00:03:46.330> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
was amazed really pretty shocked and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.190 
was amazed really pretty shocked and
then<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.470> found<00:03:48.980> because<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.270> slouch<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
then I found because if you slouch the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.990 
then I found because if you slouch the
suspenders<00:03:51.680> don't<00:03:51.920> work<00:03:52.130> but<00:03:52.700> when<00:03:52.880> you're

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
suspenders don't work but when you're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.800 
suspenders don't work but when you're
standing<00:03:53.269> upright<00:03:53.600> you've<00:03:54.109> gotta<00:03:54.320> just

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
standing upright you've gotta just

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.990 
standing upright you've gotta just
where<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.020> want<00:03:55.260> they<00:03:56.250> work<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.730> they<00:03:56.849> can

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
where you want they work and they can

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900 
where you want they work and they can
hold<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.390> pants<00:03:57.599> up<00:03:58.370> after<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.430> few<00:03:59.550> days<00:03:59.730> I

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
hold your pants up after a few days I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.550 
hold your pants up after a few days I
realized<00:04:00.239> my<00:04:00.390> posture<00:04:00.959> was<00:04:00.989> better<00:04:01.349> because

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
realized my posture was better because

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.309 
realized my posture was better because
I'm<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.610> feel<00:04:02.819> them<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.750> know<00:04:03.810> when<00:04:04.200> I'm

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
I'm I can feel them and I know when I'm

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.479 
I'm I can feel them and I know when I'm
vouching<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:05.630> think<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.780> anyways<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:08.160> makes<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
vouching I think but anyways it makes a

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.470 
vouching I think but anyways it makes a
difference<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.060> had<00:04:09.239> pretty<00:04:09.480> shocked<00:04:09.750> by

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
difference I had pretty shocked by

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.150 
difference I had pretty shocked by
something<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.599> just<00:04:12.690> don't<00:04:12.810> think<00:04:13.050> about<00:04:13.160> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
something you just don't think about so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.190 
something you just don't think about so
now<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.489> feel<00:04:15.000> like<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.239> improves<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.660> posture

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
now I feel like it improves my posture

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.159 
now I feel like it improves my posture
so<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:17.540> really<00:04:18.540> really<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.590> suspenders<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
of the season but we'll see I'm hoping

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.270 
of the season but we'll see I'm hoping
that<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.139> can<00:04:34.200> wear<00:04:34.440> these<00:04:34.590> most<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.100> time

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
that I can wear these most of the time

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.830 
that I can wear these most of the time
through<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.580> year<00:04:35.790> even<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.479> know<00:04:36.570> probably

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
through the year even you know probably

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440 
through the year even you know probably
not<00:04:37.050> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.169> summertime<00:04:37.590> but<00:04:38.270> spring<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.389> the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
not in the summertime but spring in the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.909 
not in the summertime but spring in the
fall<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.660> think<00:04:39.960> I'll<00:04:40.050> be<00:04:40.139> able<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.740> get<00:04:40.830> away

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
fall I think I'll be able to get away

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:41.659 
fall I think I'll be able to get away
just<00:04:41.130> fine

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
just fine

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:52.210 
just fine
but<00:04:42.660> anyways<00:04:42.870> I've<00:04:43.020> been<00:04:43.139> really<00:04:43.380> happy<00:04:43.590> with

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.430 

I<00:04:53.220> think<00:04:54.120> if<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.540> time<00:04:54.750> comes<00:04:54.930> when<00:04:55.080> they<00:04:55.229> wear

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
I think if the time comes when they wear

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.090 
I think if the time comes when they wear
out<00:04:56.090> will<00:04:57.090> need<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.300> buy<00:04:57.450> new<00:04:57.660> ones<00:04:57.840> if<00:04:58.100> you

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
out will need to buy new ones if you

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.130 
out will need to buy new ones if you
know<00:04:59.190> it's<00:04:59.610> been<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.820> long<00:05:00.060> time<00:05:00.240> or<00:05:00.539> I<00:05:00.570> wouldn't
