00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
yep and then I'm gonna teach you how to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.059 
yep and then I'm gonna teach you how to
easy<00:00:02.760> target<00:00:03.060> catch<00:00:03.680> so<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:06.620> my<00:00:07.620> $80

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
easy target catch so this is the my $80

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.499 
easy target catch so this is the my $80
toy<00:00:09.349> basically<00:00:10.349> has<00:00:11.000> these<00:00:12.000> little<00:00:12.150> markers

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
toy basically has these little markers

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.289 
toy basically has these little markers
right<00:00:12.660> here<00:00:12.840> show<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.349> much<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:14.700> guess

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
right here show you how much I guess

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.820 
right here show you how much I guess
pressure<00:00:16.490> this<00:00:17.490> guy<00:00:17.670> will<00:00:17.840> put<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> bolt

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
pressure this guy will put on the bolt

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.179 
pressure this guy will put on the bolt
until<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.730> starts<00:00:20.910> making<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> clicking<00:00:21.390> noise

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
until it starts making a clicking noise

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.380 
until it starts making a clicking noise
we<00:00:23.189> hit<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> clicking<00:00:23.670> noise<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.210> basically

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we hit a clicking noise it basically

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.370 
we hit a clicking noise it basically
tells<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.310> like<00:00:26.310> put<00:00:26.900> foot<00:00:27.900> pounds

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
tells you how much like put foot pounds

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
tells you how much like put foot pounds
you<00:00:28.500> put<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.189> Newton's<00:00:29.519> per<00:00:29.880> meter

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you put it on it or Newton's per meter

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.179 
you put it on it or Newton's per meter
you<00:00:30.269> placed<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.650> torque<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you placed on it how much torque you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.870 
you placed on it how much torque you
have<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.920> works<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
have on it and that's how this works so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.479 
have on it and that's how this works so
here's<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.570> socket<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
here's my socket right here I'm going to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.290 
here's my socket right here I'm going to
eject<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> stick<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:44.300> on

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
eject it and I'm going to stick it on on

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.869 
eject it and I'm going to stick it on on
there<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:47.660> with<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> manual<00:00:49.050> calls<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
there so with the manual calls for is

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.170 
there so with the manual calls for is
14.5<00:00:50.879> pounds<00:00:51.719> per<00:00:51.930> feet<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.670> 20<00:00:53.670> Newtons<00:00:54.090> per

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
14.5 pounds per feet or 20 Newtons per

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.439 
14.5 pounds per feet or 20 Newtons per
meter<00:00:55.670> basically<00:00:56.670> pretty<00:00:57.090> much<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> same

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
meter basically pretty much the same

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.689 
meter basically pretty much the same
thing<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.960> different<00:00:58.260> units<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.670> look

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
thing some different units so if we look

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.360 
thing some different units so if we look
on<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.899> guys<00:01:01.020> can't<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on you guys can't really see it but you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.299 
on you guys can't really see it but you
guys<00:01:03.090> ever<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> you'll<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:04.129> on<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
guys ever do by this you'll know on the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.240 
guys ever do by this you'll know on the
back<00:01:05.549> side<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.270> should<00:01:06.600> say<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.250> puts

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
back side it should say right here puts

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.539 
back side it should say right here puts
foot<00:01:09.210> pounds<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
foot pounds and up and down here is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
foot pounds and up and down here is
going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> show<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> numbers<00:01:12.659> from<00:01:13.380> 10<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.520> 100

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
going to show you numbers from 10 to 100

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
going to show you numbers from 10 to 100
and<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.170> capacity<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:18.680> for

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and that's the capacity for this for

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.940 
and that's the capacity for this for
this<00:01:19.710> torque<00:01:20.100> wrench<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
this torque wrench right here this is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
this torque wrench right here this is
where<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> set<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> do

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
where you set it so what I'm going to do

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
where you set it so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> sit<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> 14.5<00:01:26.210> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is I'm going to sit there to 14.5 this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
is I'm going to sit there to 14.5 this
little<00:01:27.450> metal<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:27.840> pulls<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.829> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
little metal thing pulls down like so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.760 
little metal thing pulls down like so
and<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> locking<00:01:30.659> mechanism<00:01:30.770> once

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and that's the locking mechanism once

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
and that's the locking mechanism once
it's<00:01:31.950> down<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.369> turn<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:35.670> sucks

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
it's down you can turn it so it sucks

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's down you can turn it so it sucks
with<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.299> hand<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:38.280> probably<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.759> my

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
with one hand I can probably and put my

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
with one hand I can probably and put my
foot<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> turn

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
foot right there and I'm going to turn

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.069 
foot right there and I'm going to turn
this<00:01:43.130> until<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> gets<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:46.399> 10<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.270> 0<00:01:48.420> marker

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this until it gets to 10 to the 0 marker

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.609 
this until it gets to 10 to the 0 marker
gets<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.009> 10<00:01:50.720> which<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
gets to 10 which is right there this is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
gets to 10 which is right there this is
a<00:01:52.710> zero<00:01:52.950> marker<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.579> has<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> loser<00:01:54.210> on

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
a zero marker right there has a loser on

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
a zero marker right there has a loser on
the<00:01:54.450> white<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.680> 10<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.189> side

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the white and so it was 10 on the side

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.170 
the white and so it was 10 on the side
once<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> 10<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:59.399> start<00:01:59.729> doing<00:01:59.880> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
once you get the 10 you start doing a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.179 
once you get the 10 you start doing a
half<00:02:01.079> turn<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.649> point<00:02:01.860> 5<00:02:02.189> says<00:02:02.880> 10.5

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
half turn so that's point 5 says 10.5

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.730 
half turn so that's point 5 says 10.5
this<00:02:05.189> has<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.180> 11<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.380> next<00:02:07.619> one

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
this has one so it's 11 the next one

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.710 
this has one so it's 11 the next one
says<00:02:07.920> 1.5<00:02:08.429> which<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> 11.5<00:02:10.039> next<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
says 1.5 which is 11.5 next one is to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
says 1.5 which is 11.5 next one is to
next<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.900> 2.5

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
next one is 2.5

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
next one is 2.5
next<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.310> three<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:15.150> 13<00:02:15.600> pounds<00:02:15.960> per

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
next one is three that's 13 pounds per
