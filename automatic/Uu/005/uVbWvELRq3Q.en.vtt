00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 the bush thick state the club 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
 in the state of mato grosso was 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 professional champion matogrossense you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.269
 already was goalkeeper was the goalkeeper was 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 third goalkeeper at the start of the championship 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 had one was a team assembled with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 players coming from outside and some 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 parts of the city even though it would not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 conditions of funding, not all 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 players is not modest and it was 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.289
 beginning in the first division of the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 championship matogrossense 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 I was the third goalkeeper both 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 first goalkeepers injured and then I 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 opportunity in the middle of the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.969
 championship before being the owner of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.980
 time and play to the final as 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 many prayers were needed to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 the two goalkeepers got hurt no more 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.160
 nobody was not by chance I worked 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.660
 I was in Brazil at the time. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480
 I worked four years in Brazil bank 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 with children less than 13 years old and 10 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 months 14 years until almost already snatching 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.949
 a battle I always liked to have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 this independence without ever being able to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.949
 my things and pay my bills. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 expenses right 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 and what was the second team was already the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 paulo changed I played in the sinop four 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 Months we are Chamorro champions 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 It's two months later I came to make a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 test in 1990 on September 7 of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 nineteen ninety 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.140
 I came to S達o Paulo to take a test in S達o Paulo. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 Paulo and I'm here today to do 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 here a few minutes will make 16 years there 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 Go there, go to the rock. 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.869
 I 've never seen this time marking go 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 I'm 16 years old and I'm going to 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.950
 Okay, the genius. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.520
 In these years all of S達o Paulo 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 you have come to some serious friction or 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 with the coach or a coach or with 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 a teammate without naming names 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.369
 never never never 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.799
 not all drills are paulo has one 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 a cool thing to choose 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.070
 I think coaches always brought names 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.560
 good to work, I think you have to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060
 respect but you who have the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.829
 public recognition that it is a thing 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.479
 It's cool that you have the strength of your 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 but I think it has a hierarchy 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.020
 that has to be respected but even if 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 For example, Mario Sergio was the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.759
 trainer in 1998 is a guy I like 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.039
 a lot and arrived at sao paulo hey look 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.649
 I do not want you to hit any more faults 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.760
 I simply agreed to the decision that we 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.189
 No, I was not happy with that decision. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.079
 Never answer, I never questioned anything else. 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.420
 surprise me coming from a technician from a 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.280
 all nothing then in that one at that moment 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.890
 He thought it was better here, I acted 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 did not see the great friends continue 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.459
 without striking a lack of truth did not want 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.500
 I 'm going to hit you and I will not have more 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.390
 He left the club at the end of the year and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.829
 you won the championship is not this 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.480
 year was a difficult year until the sea arrived 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 in an era that was already complicated was 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.269
 the worst year that we participated in 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.250
 Brazilian championship 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.010
 we got to stay there more or less like 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720
 the Rio de Janeiro is fighting today in the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.310
 final we escaped at the last minute 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.810
 was worsening our championship 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.120
 of the last 10 that I remember 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.450
 What do you think of this fan habit? 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.769
 for we observe that much now in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 basketball, right? 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.940
 when the girls were winning 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 winning everything right 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.930
 we did not win we played well 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
 will play for now let's go 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.120
 we won and that's when we lose like this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.280
 because they lost in the end when 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.069
 you win and when you lose them 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.569
 I think basketball and football are one 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.609
 very big subdivision football but 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.069
 also does not have that fan when 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.370
 win the big team in winning the game and 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.639
 when close can lose is not normal right 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.459
 everything involving passion and emotion is not 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.220
 that thing at the moment you the supporter 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.049
 He's got a right, he's in love with 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.639
 what you want to see always giving me 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.310
 always conquering me you've seen the 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.620
 game of S達o Paulo from above without being 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.230
 playing but sitting on the bench also there 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.609
 when I had an injury so far in that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.160
 final phase of the championship I stayed two 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.599
 I play outside games I do not watch from above 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.489
 that I went to the stadium but the sources of 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.799
 inside the locker room that is below 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.319
 manager found that on television 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.970
 and 31 good you when there is a game 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.250
 so on television is that your team is 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.470
 playing a you as a professional 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.109
 thing that surrounds you even more you 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.299
 can see the other team playing 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.129
 The team is doing more but is 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.139
 much easier to see the other team 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.879
 within the playing field than through the 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.790
 I do not know why I'm 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.650
 asking the rhythm we see it is not 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.579
 for you to get a lot for television 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 tv today you understand I 'm not 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.599
 Speaking right the question that for example 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.500
 when Fluminense play I'm looking for 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.250
 House 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.180
 me and several 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.580
 2 to 1 you get so worried about what 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.500
 Your team is making you not 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.320
 perceives the opponent's tactics right 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.020
 that accompanies your opponent more and only 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.210
 realize when you have a play where the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.170
 Unbalanced boy overall fan 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.660
 and so 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.610
 he is paying attention to your team 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.920
 after some time as 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.810
 professional I was flying, it's yours 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.760
 thinking changes in relation to football 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.710
 you see football differently 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.420
 Now the fans have every right to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.669
 see your player's mistake of cursing 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.440
 complain and can not how can you 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.050
 lose a goal like this to a 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.650
 penalty shoot-out is a natural 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.330
 fan 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.980
 Today for me, for example, it 's okay. 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.550
 different from football I see well 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.140
 different 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.140
 In fact today is this business of d
