00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.029
 so our ventilation is arranged 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.669
 apartments 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.669
 when designing a natural system 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.060
 multi-unit ventilation 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.300
 houses provided 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.689
 what is the removal of contaminated 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.210
 air will be carried through 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.439
 ventilation ducts located 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.259
 in the kitchen and in the lavatories 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.869
 battalion high schools how will be implemented 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.800
 through leaks attacked 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 porch 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590
 so the natural system works 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.840
 ventilation in the vast 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.330
 most of our homes 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.600
 what happens after installing windows to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 exit 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 after installing sealed shelves 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.620
 natural air flow stops 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.300
 which leads to stopping the work of the whole 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 natural ventilation systems and how 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.730
 consequence of the origin of the whole 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 a number of problems 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.260
 significantly reduced 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.940
 living comfort 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.810
 increased humidity decreases quality 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.390
 air increases probability 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900
 fungal lesion constructs what 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.980
 extremely unfavorable 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.810
 affects the health of residents 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.160
 there is a need 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.309
 periodically air out 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.980
 premises that creates certain 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.340
 inconvenience while airing like 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.900
 the rule happens irregularly and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.950
 short term which does not lead to a solution 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.969
 problems in general 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.669
 besides this traditional ways 

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:17.090
 airing including so 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.359
 called micro and winter airing 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:20.079
 has a number of significant 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.189
 deficiencies contributes 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.099
 drafts leads to 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.399
 extreme temperatures and 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.999
 air humidity especially in winter 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.709
 allowing penetration 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.099
 street noise nor insects 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:31.469
 increase rolling wear 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.629
 components from whence arises 

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:35.549
 probability of hacking control is needed 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.429
 airing which results in moment 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.619
 airing the loss of Kharkov to their 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.959
 The main benefits that you get in 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.279
 as a result, when windows are closed, such 

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.450
 problems and with open windows others 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.399
 there is a paradox 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.009
 situation and you bought plastic windows 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.579
 so that it is warm and quiet and eventually forced them 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.030
 constantly open 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 what is the way out 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.720
 in modern construction not 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.690
 first year applied 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.180
 sealed doll 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.310
 works the same way naturally 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 ventilation system 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.610
 design-based designers 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 documents to pledge 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.880
 window designs in special 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 devices with precise valves 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.610
 which provide flow specifications 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.340
 air and smooth operation 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 natural ventilation systems 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.280
 valve operation does not create any 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.069
 discomfort for people in 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.010
 indoors as all air flows 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.189
 flows under the ceiling providing 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.920
 continuous across the valley polluted 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.649
 of air 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.959
 the same conclusions that went up 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.369
 mixed with fresh air coming in 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.789
 from the valve is provided 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.249
 college air flow zone fence 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.989
 at the same time to taste your own 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.649
 heat protection benefits and 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:41.189
 soundproofing without disturbing the work 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.959
 ventilation systems 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.400
 in the opinion that tightness in 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.439
 Uganda is a plus is fair 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.909
 only with independent system 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.200
 forced ventilation which is not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.310
 used in mass 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 construction because of its high 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449
 cost 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.889
 that's why the window company 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.299
 understand the essence of the problem using 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.629
 customary silence valves providing 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.310
 tenants 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.140
 new microclimate and also insures itself 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.130
 from possible litigation 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.520
 which often arises by 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.860
 consumer initiative due to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.890
 problems associated with the occurrence 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.009
 mold condenser 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.139
 today in the Russian market is represented 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.149
 large enough range 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.089
 balcony plates full-time valves like 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.909
 imported and domestic 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.609
 production is usually the price of the valve 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.409
 practically does not affect the final cost 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.029
 window constructions 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.459
 however despite this some equestrian 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.339
 companies are silent about the problems with which 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.279
 future owner will inevitably face 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.669
 plastic windows either intentionally introduces it 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.189
 misleading questions relating 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.409
 to the operation of the inlet valves and systems 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.369
 natural ventilation we 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.709
 appeal to you alone save on health 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.739
 their customers
