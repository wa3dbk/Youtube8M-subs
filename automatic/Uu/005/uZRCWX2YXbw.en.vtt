 I think everyone already heard about the toy 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.790
 flappy bird and the fact that the creator deleted 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.590
 her from all digital stores supposedly he 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.930
 could not bear the fact that his brainchild 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.640
 made with people namely transformed them 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.770
 drug addicts who can only that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.960
 the game is sold on ebay for fabulous 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.000
 money 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.770
 someone even began to threaten the creator 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.630
 punishment if the game does not return to the store 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.979

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.830
 creating a mass java called 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.200
 happy jump 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.330

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.069
 his palm on a series of conditions 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.750
 need to create wildly hardcore and 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.610
 impossible passage endless 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 runner in flappy bird manner 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.970

 the main thing is games 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.530
 and got the news to give as much because 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 that the presentation was noticed and not 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.590
 of course the fact that independent projects 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.959
 go out nintendo eshop is not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.700
 something supernatural here is the whole point 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.500
 that nintendo chooses 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.120
 special project and which is absolutely 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.400
 will gain success with television revenue 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.230
 nintendo well as among those represented on

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.340
 news and retro city rampage iii exit 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.799
 on nintendo i. became pretty 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 unusual interesting at least in 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.190
 In my eyes, this was another plus for 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:06.769
 to get a prototype like 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:08.329
 nintendo what do you think to make 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.609
 if the movie star landing troops were baptized 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.139
 the very first counter developers from 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.000
 graphite labs think in that case 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.010
 their upcoming hyip project would have turned out 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.199
 jump that just recently started 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.449
 kickstarter fundraising let's 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.310

 twenty fourth century flight time 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.360
 distant planets and galaxies with a view and 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.889
 in colonization and here on one of those on 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.199
 first sight of lifeless planets people 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.490
 will face huge beetles 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.440
 Naturally the colony which was engaged 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.990
 there the extraction of resources was destroyed a 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.970
 the government that worked on it killed 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.440
 people in the faces eumont systems alliance decides 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.330
 declare war on the beetles and sends on 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.159
 the planet the armed forces which is now 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.350
 must pass from the surface of the planet to 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.570
 its center so that they have 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.820
 already a nest of beetles here for 1 and 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.560
 salad to play immediately stands 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.150
 say high jump multiplayer 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.920
 cooperative project and the basis of gameplay 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.380
 built precisely on the interaction of those 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480
 playing though it said too loudly 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.040
 for it all comes down to the fact that huge 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.240
 a number of people are shot simultaneously 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.130
 no more bugs 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.290

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.140

 and a flamethrower everyone can such an abundance 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.760
 find something like an important 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.650
 is the ability to pump your 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.840
 weapons and not only him at the expense of mining 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.820
