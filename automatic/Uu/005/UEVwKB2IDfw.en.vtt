00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
for these legacy live events you start

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.160 
for these legacy live events you start
up<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.550> third<00:02:40.970> quarter<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.690> second

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
up in the third quarter so the second

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.560 
up in the third quarter so the second
half<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.620> they're<00:02:42.980> only<00:02:43.010> 45<00:02:43.670> second<00:02:44.120> quarters

half and they're only 45 second quarters

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.540 
half and they're only 45 second quarters
which<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.590> kind<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.890> sucks<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.400> I'm

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
which I think kind of sucks if I'm

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.830 
which I think kind of sucks if I'm
expecting<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> play<00:02:47.150> with<00:02:47.330> my<00:02:47.450> team<00:02:47.630> from<00:02:47.780> last

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
expecting to play with my team from last

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.750 
expecting to play with my team from last
season<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.530> worked<00:02:48.770> really<00:02:48.860> hard<00:02:49.069> on<00:02:49.430> I'm

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
season that I worked really hard on I'm

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.699 
season that I worked really hard on I'm
kind<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.330> expecting<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.080> ahead<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.560> play<00:02:51.680> a

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
kind of expecting to go ahead and play a

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.890 
kind of expecting to go ahead and play a
full<00:02:51.980> game<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.910> start<00:02:53.239> up<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> second

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
full game not start up in the second

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.600 
full game not start up in the second
half<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.320> there's<00:02:54.470> only<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.190> min

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
half and there's only going to be a min

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.720 
half and there's only going to be a min
in<00:02:55.730> 30<00:02:55.970> seconds<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.570> gameplay<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.400> maybe<00:02:58.580> they

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
in 30 seconds of gameplay so maybe they

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.100 
in 30 seconds of gameplay so maybe they
can<00:02:58.910> make<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.300> we<00:02:59.390> start<00:02:59.600> up<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> first

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
can make it so we start up in the first

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.890 
can make it so we start up in the first
quarter<00:03:00.440> start<00:03:00.830> from<00:03:00.980> kickoff<00:03:01.519> um<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.720> would

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
quarter start from kickoff um it would

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.720 
quarter start from kickoff um it would
be<00:03:03.050> really<00:03:03.230> nice<00:03:03.530> because<00:03:03.830> think<00:03:04.400> about<00:03:04.459> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
be really nice because think about it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.060 
be really nice because think about it
we're<00:03:05.300> playing<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:06.140> live<00:03:06.410> event<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.010> it

we're playing this live event and it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.460 
we're playing this live event and it

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:14.920 
know like throwing is a little weird
right<00:06:12.080> now<00:06:12.349> it's<00:06:12.529> a<00:06:12.589> little<00:06:12.769> funky<00:06:13.689> once<00:06:14.689> your

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
right now it's a little funky once your

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.259 
right now it's a little funky once your
offensive<00:06:15.769> line<00:06:15.800> kind<00:06:16.189> of<00:06:16.339> lets<00:06:16.519> one<00:06:16.759> guy<00:06:16.939> pass

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:17.269 
offensive line kind of lets one guy pass

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:19.059 
offensive line kind of lets one guy pass
it's<00:06:17.689> an<00:06:17.899> automatic<00:06:18.259> sack<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.769> can't<00:06:18.979> even

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
it's an automatic sack you can't even

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.949 
it's an automatic sack you can't even
throw<00:06:19.189> the<00:06:19.370> ball<00:06:19.519> for<00:06:19.729> some<00:06:19.909> reason<00:06:20.240> which<00:06:20.809> i

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
throw the ball for some reason which i

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.329 
throw the ball for some reason which i
think<00:06:21.019> is<00:06:21.259> really<00:06:21.469> weird<00:06:21.709> hopefully<00:06:22.009> they'll

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
think is really weird hopefully they'll

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:23.920 
think is really weird hopefully they'll
fix<00:06:22.610> that<00:06:22.819> because<00:06:23.209> it's<00:06:23.419> just<00:06:23.599> kind<00:06:23.809> of<00:06:23.839> a

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
fix that because it's just kind of a

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.659 
fix that because it's just kind of a
pain<00:06:24.169> because<00:06:24.319> it's<00:06:24.439> like<00:06:24.709> an<00:06:24.800> automatic<00:06:25.339> sack

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
pain because it's like an automatic sack

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.269 
pain because it's like an automatic sack
it's<00:06:26.419> like<00:06:26.509> an<00:06:26.629> automatic<00:06:27.019> suction<00:06:27.409> cackling

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
it's like an automatic suction cackling

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:29.649 
it's like an automatic suction cackling
they<00:06:28.370> just<00:06:28.550> tackle<00:06:28.909> you<00:06:29.029> you<00:06:29.149> can't<00:06:29.360> even<00:06:29.449> let

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
they just tackle you you can't even let

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.199 
they just tackle you you can't even let
go<00:06:29.809> the<00:06:29.959> ball<00:06:30.139> and<00:06:30.379> then<00:06:31.069> hopefully<00:06:31.909> that<00:06:32.059> gal

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:32.209 
go the ball and then hopefully that gal

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:33.969 
go the ball and then hopefully that gal
does<00:06:32.419> get<00:06:32.629> fixed<00:06:33.019> in<00:06:33.199> the<00:06:33.529> next<00:06:33.559> couple

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
does get fixed in the next couple

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.279 
does get fixed in the next couple
updates<00:06:34.550> because<00:06:34.819> throwing<00:06:35.749> is<00:06:35.839> a<00:06:35.870> big<00:06:36.050> part

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
updates because throwing is a big part

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.199
