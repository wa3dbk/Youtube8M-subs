00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
really with family and friends is that

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.360 
really with family and friends is that
all<00:00:49.780> have<00:00:49.960> been<00:00:50.110> involved<00:00:50.590> in<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.770> church<00:00:51.010> and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
all have been involved in a church and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.700 
all have been involved in a church and
so<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:54.670> all<00:00:54.940> believe<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.420> they're<00:00:56.050> they're

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
just fine you know whether it be just

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.420 
just fine you know whether it be just
from<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.460> fact<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.960> think<00:01:02.320> they<00:01:02.530> they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
from the fact that they think they they

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.920 
from the fact that they think they they
