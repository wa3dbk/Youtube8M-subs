around<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.110> side<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> good

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
around the side so it's quite a good

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
around the side so it's quite a good
place<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.820> next<00:00:54.570> hiding<00:00:54.960> spot<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> really

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
place the next hiding spot is really

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
place the next hiding spot is really
effective<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.309> should<00:00:56.579> shoot<00:00:57.239> these<00:00:57.420> gas

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
effective if you should shoot these gas

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.110 
effective if you should shoot these gas
pipes<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.460> completely<00:00:59.789> hidden

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
pipes first as you are completely hidden

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.139 
pipes first as you are completely hidden
when<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> jump<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.899> top<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.350> control<00:01:01.890> box

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
when you jump on top of this control box

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.399 
when you jump on top of this control box
and<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and when you are up there you can see

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
and when you are up there you can see
the<00:01:04.890> sea<00:01:05.250> flag<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.570> over<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the sea flag which is just over in the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.039 
the sea flag which is just over in the
corner<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.010> session<00:01:08.790> destroy<00:01:09.049> planting

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
corner and the session destroy planting

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
corner and the session destroy planting
facility<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:11.250> where<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.729> standing<00:01:11.909> now

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
facility is also where I'm standing now

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.530 
facility is also where I'm standing now
I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> quite<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.460> cool<00:01:14.670> glitch<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
I think so it is quite a cool glitch the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
I think so it is quite a cool glitch the
next<00:01:16.320> clip<00:01:16.470> I'm<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.369> show<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.880> sort

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
next clip I'm going to show you is sort

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
next clip I'm going to show you is sort
of<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> map<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> same<00:01:20.280> time

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
of out the map and not at the same time

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
of out the map and not at the same time
you're<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.509> mean<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you're going to see what I mean in a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
you're going to see what I mean in a
minute<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.439> found<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.159> scratch<00:01:23.369> myself<00:01:23.549> guys

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
minute I found the scratch myself guys

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
minute I found the scratch myself guys
and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.229> quite<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.409> nice<00:01:25.619> spot<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and I think it's quite a nice spot you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
and I think it's quite a nice spot you
can<00:01:26.369> catch<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> people<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.150> run<00:01:27.180> around<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
can catch the people that run around the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
can catch the people that run around the
corner<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.060> there's<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
corner and there's well it's like a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.060 
corner and there's well it's like a
two-part<00:01:31.170> lecture<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
two-part lecture about to see in a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
two-part lecture about to see in a
minute<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.909> when<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
minute so when you do get up there it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
minute so when you do get up there it
does<00:01:34.229> take<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> time<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> do

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
does take a bit of time but when you do

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.469 
does take a bit of time but when you do
out<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.689> worth<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.110> because

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
out there I think it's worth it because

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
out there I think it's worth it because
you<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.869> hidden<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:41.070> you're

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you pretty much hidden when you're

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
also quite a good spot for survival mode

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.399 
also quite a good spot for survival mode

which<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.079> deserves<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
which I really do think it deserves a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
which I really do think it deserves a
like<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.950> by<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.329> pro<00:02:06.570> in

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like and by the way if you go pro in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
like and by the way if you go pro in
these<00:02:06.869> boxes<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.530> cannot<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:08.009> seen<00:02:08.250> you're

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
these boxes you cannot be seen you're

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
these boxes you cannot be seen you're
pretty<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:08.940> invisible<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> enemy<00:02:10.020> as

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
pretty much invisible from the enemy as

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
pretty much invisible from the enemy as
you're<00:02:10.890> inside<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> boxes

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you're inside the boxes

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.759 
you're inside the boxes
and<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.349> also<00:02:13.530> hidden<00:02:14.159> from<00:02:15.769> attack

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
and you're also hidden from attack

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.679 
and you're also hidden from attack
helicopters<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.579> there's<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> roof<00:02:18.239> above<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
helicopters as there's a roof above you

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.110 
helicopters as there's a roof above you
so<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.379> possibly<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.250> wrist<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.939> you're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.530 
so this is possibly the wrist but you're
ever<00:02:21.269> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.569> see<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.989> bootleg<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
ever going to see on bootleg and

personally that deserves are like the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.399 
personally that deserves are like the
next<00:02:27.269> part<00:02:27.450> i'm<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.750> show<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.930> guys<00:02:28.049> is

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
next part i'm going to show you guys is

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.670 
next part i'm going to show you guys is
on<00:02:28.980> hardhat<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:30.180> need<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.480> run<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.260> jump<00:02:31.379> in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
on hardhat you need to run and jump in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.589 
on hardhat you need to run and jump in
the<00:02:31.739> little<00:02:32.340> corner<00:02:32.700> which<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.909> just<00:02:32.940> saw<00:02:33.180> in

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
the little corner which you just saw in

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.720 
the little corner which you just saw in
between<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> power<00:02:34.530> light<00:02:34.920> generator<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
between the power light generator and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970 
between the power light generator and
the<00:02:35.790> oil<00:02:36.360> cans<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.409> when<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.650> when<00:02:37.769> you're<00:02:37.890> up

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the oil cans and when you when you're up

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.319 
the oil cans and when you when you're up
here<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.400> go<00:02:38.489> into<00:02:38.609> this<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:39.000> spot<00:02:39.180> as

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
here you can go into this little spot as

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.539 
here you can go into this little spot as
well<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.019> sort<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> act<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.560> once<00:02:41.250> again

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
well so it's sort of act like once again

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.670 
well so it's sort of act like once again
and<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.209> also<00:02:42.420> works<00:02:42.659> for<00:02:42.870> survival<00:02:43.470> mode

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and this also works for survival mode

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.559 
and this also works for survival mode
and<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.640> you're<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.090> little<00:02:45.239> spot

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
and when you're on this little spot

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.349 
and when you're on this little spot
people<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.500> bots<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.579> people<00:02:47.909> whatever<00:02:48.120> want

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
people the bots the people whatever want

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.300 
people the bots the people whatever want
to<00:02:48.450> call<00:02:48.599> them<00:02:48.720> they<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.560> crowd<00:02:49.920> around<00:02:50.159> they

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to call them they just crowd around they

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
to call them they just crowd around they
don't<00:02:50.489> shoot<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.109> know

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
where you are if you know what i mean is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.869 
where you are if you know what i mean is
you're<00:02:53.970> out<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> map<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:56.190> there's<00:02:56.670> two

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
you're out the map and the there's two

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.640 
you're out the map and the there's two
more<00:02:57.030> glitches<00:02:57.239> well<00:02:57.750> hiding<00:02:58.170> spots<00:02:58.379> really

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
more glitches well hiding spots really

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.580 
more glitches well hiding spots really
on<00:02:59.329> resistance<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.019> see<00:03:01.139> that<00:03:01.170> what

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
on resistance and you can see that what

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.080 
on resistance and you can see that what
they<00:03:01.680> are<00:03:01.799> they're<00:03:02.040> pretty<00:03:02.250> basic<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:03.000> be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
they are they're pretty basic to be

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.720 
they are they're pretty basic to be
honest<00:03:03.329> but<00:03:04.170> anyway<00:03:04.799> guys<00:03:05.010> thanks<00:03:05.579> guys<00:03:05.700> for
