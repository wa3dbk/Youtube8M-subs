 but maybe new standards 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 I can not handle classes with Seifert 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160

 Graumann 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.140
 but still 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
 Now it seems suddenly to stand why 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.400
 Now it's suddenly happening 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.780
 March is not always hovering 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.520
 "If you eat fat Erbach 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520

 Daniel Dietrich is lying 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.549
 the Federation is the only human in the world who creates Meadow Backups 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.229

 Nelles is real possible her income entry further 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 that was Sept, of course 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.309
 and that will now be at a speed of 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.619
 I do not do that for the weights 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.829
 so considered our people will have little i had this babic 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.829

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.859
 more like visiting Riethers, however 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 I do not care for it 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.859
 who really does not do that 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.859

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.279
 there was only one missing 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.389
