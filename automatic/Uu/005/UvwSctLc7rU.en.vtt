00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good kids that as you are 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.580
 watching the channel finally I bring you the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.930
 video that many of you are 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 waiting for you are asking me a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.830
 heap that he was going to bring the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 video as it sounds bad sorry for the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 delay because I've been very busy 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 I've been doing things of interest the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 really been reporting in a lot of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 things like that since we're going to have the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 sticks the following videos are going to be 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.960
 referring to the interest that I think 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 this afternoon at the most we will be able to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 take out full and there are enough people that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.029
 I think that even the first ones have 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.830
 been British that were 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 streaming the bastards cut 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.829
 this unfair when they were going to do the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 last step but when it is partly 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.210
 logical, that 's different, but let's 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
 talk about the improved fire stick is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 a cane that has a potential 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 amazing and I think he has the puzzle 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
 more complicated to do of all the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.100
 improved canes so once said 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 that's ready 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.670
 said these kids I will try 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
 explain myself as best as possible and nothing is going 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.840
 there with the improvement tutorial 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.489
 fire stick good as always 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 I say at the beginning of each tutorial 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.449
 you always have in the description how 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.850
 create the staff in its normal form and the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 first step because it is simply to create it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 well let's move on to the puzzle that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.740
 we always have to do you know that every 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 cane to improve it has like two 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 puzzle the first is action by letter and the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 second is done on the map at this point 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 it's simply to kill with the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 fire stick in the cane area of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 fire from the portal of fire here inside 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.659
 of the letter and nothing because it simply 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.330
 they send air and light some flames 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 as we go killing in the bowls 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 those of fire and that 's it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.539
 there you have heard the sound of the step is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 I completed the kids, we go there 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.460
 with the cane improvement step the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 puzzle without a doubt I think the most 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.509
 difficult the most difficult to decipher from 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.580
 all the canes as I said before 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.530
 there is always one in the letter in this case 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.789
 it's the easiest fire but instead 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.580
 which is done on the map 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.570
 that is the most difficult the fire for 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.150
 understand correctly 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.380
 this puzzle you have to observe the image 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.570
 that I am putting you right now in 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 screen is that you are watching a series 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.550
 of numbers and on top of each number there is 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.950
 a kind of circles some are 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.050
 others on are off in color 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.960
 gray on black 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.090
 ok you have to understand what 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.580
 on top of each number there is a grouping 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.290
 of points there are seven groupings of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.990
 points along this entire wall in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.670
 total I explain to you over eleven we see 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.950
 a grouping of points that in this 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 case was off above the number 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.220
 five we see another grouping of points 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.830
 that in this case it came out on 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.180
 above number nine we see another 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.160
 grouping of points that I also 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.960
 it went on fire on top of number seven 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.850
 we see another one that was not turned on 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.500
 above number six we see another no 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.020
 I was on top of number three 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.330
 we see another one that was on and the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.910
 last seven is the one above 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.700
 of the number four that came out on me 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.680
 It is worth to you when you have completed the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.950
 previous step in the letter you come here 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.300
 and you will get several groupings 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.430
 turned on this is totally random 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.870
 you can leave the same faces that I 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 have come out here in this case lit 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.580
 you can leave others that means this 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.230
 then you start you put this 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.930
 picture in my video and you start from 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.000
 left to right you say it's worth 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.970
 first group is the one above 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.430
 of the number 11 has left me on not 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.590
 because I do not fucking case he is 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.040
 above number 5 in this case I'm going 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.620
 to talk 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.329
 it came out to me if it's on so 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.549
 so much if we have to listen to him and 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.680
 this refers to the order that 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.560
 we have to light the torches of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.659
 down with the fire stick is a bit 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.980
 difficult to understand but they are attentive and 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.680
 You will see how you understand when I finish 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.810
 explain it is worth as the second 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.909
 grouping in this case to me if it came out 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.189
 on means that the first 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.560
 torch that we have to ignite is the 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.299
 number 5 if you do not know below this 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.909
 plant each torch has its number 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.709
 we move on to the next group if 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.030
 it's on so we know that 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.519
 the second torch that we have to 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.290
 give it is the one with the number 9 the 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.019
 clusters of points that are on top 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.760
 of 7 and 6 we do not make a fucking case 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.340
 because in this case they have not left us 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.049
 turned on it is worth then we go to the number 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.150
 3 to the group that we have over and 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.189
 if it is on therefore keep the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.590
 third torch is the one that will have the 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.450
 number 3 below in the last grouping 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.000
 as we see it means that the fourth 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.239
 we have to give you a torch 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.400
 is the one with the number 4 simply 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.500
 you have to fix and groups of 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.150
 points as I tell you there are 7 out 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.450
 lit in your game imagine 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.400
 that you leave the first group the 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.690
 from number 7 to number 6 and from 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.150
 number 3 because it is already simply 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.910
 we press first on the torch 11 then 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.960
 7 then 6 and then the and then the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.750
 3 this part of a part code of a 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.270
 code deciphering the points with 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.070
 ternary numbers but here you os what 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.870
 I say let's say everything chewed because 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.730
 the code is deciphered below 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.410
 then put simply you see the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.020
 grouping of points that is on 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.700
 and now look at the beats you look at the image and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.150
 you know what torch you have to press and 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.610
 in what good order 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.530
 in this case we have left my order 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 it would be torch number 5 torch 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.970
 torch number 9 torch number 3 and 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.670
 torch number 4 so below 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.410
 you're going to see how the courses in that in that 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.270
 order you can not go wrong and 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.130
 obviously it has to be quick to 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.050
 that the previous one does not extinguish therefore good 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.570
 once we have completed it, it sounds 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.890
 the challenge noise completed and already 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.900
 just then we go to the pack to 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.560
 punch and the usual 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.560
 yes 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.479
 Well, once here as you know 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.190
 we hit the shot to saving the 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.960
 color that is put there that in this case 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.960
 how are we improving the cane of 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.610
 fire it would be the red orb and nothing 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.169
 because we simply align the lights 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.849
 same as you first gave the urb and 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.879
 then to the lights or the lights and 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.919
 after the orb is going to give the same good 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.349
 they light up we have the step done and 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.300
 already as you know then agartha and to put the 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.919
 cane there has a very strange name on 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.229
 Improved cane that I forgot to say 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.180
 before but fuck if a name that fabric 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.319
 here you see how I improve it and not what it does not 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.789
 I picked it up instantly because it was 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.680
 trying to improve them all so that 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.599
 would measure the achievement and such to catch all 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.729
 the canes but good here so what 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.909
 I push attention to the blood name of 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.409
 shit suck or be each you with that putt and 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.389
 Simon Man , I told you yesterday that I was 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.150
 missing these weird names 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.949
 that they give for putting in the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.690
 weapons and here I put myself to try the 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.180
 special shot that this cane has 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.469
 I want to upload a video why you chose 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.969
 in the comments, get away from there 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.770
 realized what each cane has its 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:32.500
 special shot so I want to upload a 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.780
 video analyzing all the shots 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.409
 specials of each cane improved well 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.089
 what good people 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.309
 I have thought yours is the following video 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.860
 how to improve some fists that are achieved 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:45.139
 making the challenges of reaching the 4 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.089
 Chests can be improved and it's pretty 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.939
 equal and kill in round 28 so that 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:51.229
 fix that 7 and I also have thought 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.419
 raise the interest because we have it 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.309
 almost done and soon I'll start 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.749
 upload it so people are supporting 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.279
 the videos as you are doing until 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:01.749
 now I thank you a lot and we 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.749
 we see in the next video bye bye
