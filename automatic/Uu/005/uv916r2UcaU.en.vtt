my<00:00:10.469> guess<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.740> even<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.639> child<00:00:11.940> big<00:00:12.360> wheel<00:00:12.630> would

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
my guess is even a child big wheel would

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
not that's what I'm going to attempt to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.720 
not that's what I'm going to attempt to
prove<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.380> big<00:00:19.650> wheel<00:00:19.890> versus
