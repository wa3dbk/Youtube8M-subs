to do is get kills and it's easier to

well I call it in her right away I think
it's<00:04:28.170> ready<00:04:28.350> at<00:04:28.470> five<00:04:28.590> thousand<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.310> if

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
it's ready at five thousand and if

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.920 
it's ready at five thousand and if
throughout<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.030> game<00:04:30.150> goes<00:04:30.360> by<00:04:30.480> quickly<00:04:30.720> if

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
throughout the game goes by quickly if

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.050 
throughout the game goes by quickly if
my<00:04:31.020> team's<00:04:31.260> mates<00:04:31.560> are<00:04:31.710> getting<00:04:31.890> kills<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.970> I

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
my team's mates are getting kills and I

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.270 
my team's mates are getting kills and I
knew<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.450> there's<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.530> game<00:04:34.680> could<00:04:35.010> go<00:04:35.130> by

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
knew that there's the game could go by

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.140 
knew that there's the game could go by
pretty<00:04:35.400> quickly<00:04:37.640> so<00:04:40.220> somehow<00:04:41.220> they<00:04:41.520> get<00:04:41.730> an

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
pretty quickly so somehow they get an

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.980 
pretty quickly so somehow they get an
airstrike<00:04:44.210> seems<00:04:45.210> whenever<00:04:45.390> I'm<00:04:45.600> doing<00:04:45.840> good

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
airstrike seems whenever I'm doing good

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.110 
airstrike seems whenever I'm doing good
my<00:04:46.140> teammates<00:04:46.470> never<00:04:46.980> really<00:04:47.280> are<00:04:47.430> which<00:04:48.000> I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
my teammates never really are which I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.580 
my teammates never really are which I
guess<00:04:48.150> kind<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.630> benefits<00:04:48.960> me<00:04:49.110> because<00:04:49.440> I'm

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
guess kind of benefits me because I'm

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.530 
guess kind of benefits me because I'm
able<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.950> get<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.400> lot<00:04:50.700> more<00:04:50.730> kills<00:04:51.150> if<00:04:51.419> they

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
able to get a lot more kills if they

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.590 
able to get a lot more kills if they
aren't<00:04:51.720> doing<00:04:51.960> good<00:04:52.460> that's<00:04:53.460> why<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:54.030> don't

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
aren't doing good that's why I don't

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
aren't doing good that's why I don't
really<00:04:54.690> have<00:04:54.840> many<00:04:55.169> but<00:04:55.980> many<00:04:56.160> games<00:04:56.430> that

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
really have many but many games that

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.800 
really have many but many games that
bloated<00:04:56.790> when<00:04:57.060> I'm<00:04:57.150> playing<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.480> like<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> full

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
bloated when I'm playing in like a full

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.070 
bloated when I'm playing in like a full
party<00:04:58.140> because<00:04:58.500> i<00:04:58.860> usually<00:04:59.490> do<00:04:59.880> good<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:00.930> them

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
party because i usually do good in them

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.320 
party because i usually do good in them
it's<00:05:01.290> just<00:05:01.560> not<00:05:01.770> good<00:05:02.010> enough<00:05:02.040> because<00:05:02.250> all<00:05:03.030> my

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
it's just not good enough because all my

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.909 
it's just not good enough because all my
teammates<00:05:03.930> are<00:05:04.140> getting<00:05:04.350> killed<00:05:04.470> soup<00:05:04.740> cuz
