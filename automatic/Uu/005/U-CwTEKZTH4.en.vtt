00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 the gurizada was not what we saw there is more 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.670
 a video that the uff leaves from the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 hell and today we will not have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.320
 No one here in the channel will have 51 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 video here talking a little about the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.199
 future of the canal, which is something that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.539
 You have asked me a lot about the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.609
 rtb of the adoro because the rt of in the code b2 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 it was a series that much in the channel 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 it is there that has blown most today and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 I was very anxious to bring her 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 that back in sometimes I give faith but by 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 while it will not be possible and I will 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.760
 explain this to you already show how 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.860
 is the camouflage system of the game for 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 those who do not know then woman 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 You're a girlfriend, for example. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.399
 as verbal 27 beds out with the people 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 release for example the last carriage 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.859
 that this year the red shorts dem dem that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.090
 has no less than 500 headshots with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.860
 a ball 27 man that's a lot still 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.549
 more considering that every time the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 prestige, that tit says reserve so then 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.590
 Face is very well, good, good, good, well, well 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.790
 very complicated it is practically 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 impossible to bring a rpg and that there rtd 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.020
 because gold is now very easy neither 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.700
 everyone knows the daemon of that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.509
 equivalent to the goal against what has to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 see all camouflage and opway royale 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.710
 And our guy has a lot of difficulty 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.689
 Your words to him I do not know that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 You already realized that's the way it is. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.930
 very big yes it is strange but it is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.070
 The geologist has already informed the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 center here is a look and have to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.229
 release has footprint is a man all of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 class so expensive very very much 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.810
 difficult and I was thinking here of guns 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.470
 donated to bring rtv just happens here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750
 O 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.939
 There's no way to hide the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 disk was already has no desire on the page 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.500
 faquinha slaps who already was next to is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.410
 and we go here in the cosmos 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.319
 fucking and level 48 fucking would have to give 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.469
 an airplane must still be cast 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 but also for the 500 net guns 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:24.989
 shorts going nassau tears kill 75 players 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.409
 with a weapon that only takes by helicopter 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.060
 that it is impossible to draw poetic hand 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.950
 have made but are interconnected this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.019
 It is the thing that is badly done this 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.329
 game beyond the connecting rods that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.319
 do not work and this is complete 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.510
 mind ridiculous thaÃ­de kuta a shame 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.879
 I have this game in all the videos today 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.129
 was in the game fun but question of the 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.739
 camouflage is a shame and here the 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.879
 explanation to you of why people 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.260
 still does not have an rt of that code in 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.939
 I liked how I learned that they 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.250
 changed these chances after a 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.530
 time, I'll leave here a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.760
 tweet credit ready you go there you 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 They'll put it there and it's done. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 automatically and then we 'll send them 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.590
 will run and give you and activist talking about 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.079
 we want to improve this system of 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.930
 camouflage because it's really ridiculous 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.509
 is the boost or champion of the score to July 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.449
 to get everyone we're do it 's walking 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.979
 because really playing in morale is 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:27.000
 I do not want to say that your 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:29.759
 prestige and three already and old oms as does 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.340
 what I have here is this type here 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:36.090
 to gold and another one I got 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.370
 cardoso this one to pick up 50 of 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.000
 network shots that is not too difficult either 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.540
 like this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.879
 But fuck, old fuck, you 're good. 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.040
 to fuck're so connected that's it 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.449
 That's why we do not have the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.759
 the or code in this code 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.009
 it will be so where and how good to have you are 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.019
 practically this alone increases the 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.930
 difficulty but keeping the same shit 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.669
 so I'll worry about camouflage 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.959
 when I pick up your game if I were you 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.189
 Who did not catch who already got 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.280
 probably not worrying 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.629
 with that and the day's trick is going 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.609
 change a little format because it is 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.989
 too heavy for me to bring every day 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.699
 So every day when people 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.139
 exceed the target for the likes 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.719
 first video we will have the second 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.280
 video that will be the tip of the day then 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.650
 this first video here with a video 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.350
 more informative and such I put a 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.700
 low average and 1 500 wii 2 thousand ha 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.820
 then we can get past a thousand and 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.740
 Five hundred and I'm going to send a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.350
 new tip of the day so this is what I have 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.690
 a goal is a system there that I do not 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.890
 I am the biggest was this but it is unfortunately 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.260
 that she is having a lot of work 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.000
 trying to reconcile with a lot of things and I 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.370
 I do youtube mainly because I 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.280
 taste and the thing I like most about 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.200
 youtube is just the feedback and com 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.580
 This goal I will end up liking more 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.840
 it's still doing that job we 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.400
 so I hope that everyone understands that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.650
 You like it and that's it. 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.290
 a hug for you until the next one 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.290
 I hug a hug again and went
