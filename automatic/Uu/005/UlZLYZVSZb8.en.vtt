00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:11.620
 Then I want to start a personal computer course by myself 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:16.720
 So this time I would like to explain the extension 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:22.590
 Yes it may not be for beginners, but if you know it 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.220
 I would like to Anochotto description since there may be convenient Once However if 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.710
 The 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:33.100
 Imazu is an extension, but what does this say 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.530
 Become a part of 8 file name 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.010
 It is to file name 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.019
 It is in the inside . 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.019
 Character history after taking 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.140
 It's low specifically when you start Explorer for a while 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 Although it is such form is now the file name are you with this 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 It becomes grandfather after one dot period of this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:10.560
 In it it is seen as this package. It is a form that does not come out to Gadoko of Tteyuu 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 It is written me this six in it is correct this fact back I or untitled. Jp harsh and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.120
 Ne 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.120
 Untitled. I actually have png and so on the back 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190
 It is an extension 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.130
 Yes 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:31.230
 It is because this fruit also I file there are two I six now, but this is I file of the real 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.350
 The name itself is different 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.860
 So you say, for example, it is useless under this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.980
 Copy 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.510
 Paste to the same place 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:48.900
 And if you do that, then this copy is automatically attached , but when you delete this letter 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:52.650
 I What happens say if or rather become I think I made in that error error that already 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.870
 It has come out like a file with the same name 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.870
 It is a form that can not be changed 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:09.160
 It is the capital of what to do is to make display So is it that around if yes it is 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.350
 That 's right , start Explorer 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.570
 This is- 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.570
 Please try to press the windows machine plus e If you did not closet 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.420
 It's a + key, so it will come out 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.760
 It entered and came out, but a ridge 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.019
 It is then once the alt key if you probably do not because I think that the menu is not out 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.019
 Did you buy for a moment 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.500
 To extension armor 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.130
 In in cages at the time 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.130
 Right side 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.480
 It is the tool of from here in the I came out I am kind of form which now menu 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.420
 Folder option 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:16.700
 Enter here and click the display tab. 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.000
 The extension registered in the lower part of the list may not be displayed. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.750
 I will 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.010
 I I'm with now check this is to remove this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.610
 Good 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.810
 Please press ok 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.230
 Yes all that to do so and those of Hey Explorer is a must 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.260
 It is shaped to have an extension 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:41.200
 If you look at the 6 files ahead low 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.780
 It is this time . It is jp tool or something. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.780
 It will be a form that I understood that it was a file 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:58.110
 You're in and say there is a kind of advantage if it is put out this extension 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 8 I think that it is almost not with recent applications 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:08.010
 That 's overseas software or something 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:13.019
 If you do not give put it up to the extension when you save it with something name that successfully saved 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:17.689
 Conscious of it a little extension is because that does not may be a case to be or not be 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.689
 I think I should do it 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.620
 After that there are 2 types of Explorer now, and jpeg and here 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.900
 I'm out with or bng 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.370
 Look here and you should do it, but in the water you are at the top of this file 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.490
 It is an icon 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:43.880
 The image of the icon believe Kere Mu air of the enter key and the face is Hey Well problem strike 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:50.110
 Such a case if I'm not a problem but if there I Toka file is sometimes the virus 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:55.030
 Most here have been disguised because it has become to do the image without another relationship file 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:58.330
 True it is gone and run the mistaken image file but it is what virus 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.730
 It seems that there was a long time ago that it became infected 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.730
 Maybe it still exists now 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.289
 So when you do, that always 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.390
 See the type or 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:19.070
 If you do not have a type extension, you can only look at liquor 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:22.620
 I often see that detail now, but when I make it a large icon 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:28.020
 You know it and not in extension 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:32.460
 I think I do not know well, but if it is an extension properly 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.449
 See you because of the buying file the I mean Tsu be without executing such a strange file 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.449
 There is 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.260
 I wonder if it becomes the description of the prima facie extension 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.780
 It is good after that 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.830
 The 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.569
 One thing is a bit of an aside, but it's windows 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:59.849
 Because this extension is had become quite important 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:01.340
 Now it is decided which kind of software to open 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.740
 For example 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.190
 If it is a file called jpeg 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.849
 This is installed 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:17.740
 Let's open it with the image viewer 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:21.560
 Or trying to get open if the kiss island Te after at Toka Notepad 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.330
 For example, if it is html 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.980
 Browser 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:32.310
 Let's open it, what's up later with xl and so on 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:39.100
 excel a bit old-fashioned rest xls 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:41.990
 It is Toka'm excel if I but I think a little what has recently changed 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:48.650
 There are many, yes 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:50.880
 Or extensions and and what apps role in tone is 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:57.880
 Clogged 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 The file will no longer be opened and the I's and say to reverse the extension to be appropriate 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:06.940
 For example, there is a png file here 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:11.480
 Just circle is written, but for example this extension 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:15.800
 And have a little tx et to give back 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.529
 When I execute this, I can open it with Notepad. 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.270
 Because it is a cream 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:26.000
 It is a form that the image file is opened with adjustment in Notepad . 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:30.730
 I can open it because I did not get this error 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.730
 There may be a case where an error may occur. 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.970
 After that , when you put out the extension, it's in that sphere 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:46.300
 You can't create the same file in the same folder . 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.220
 Sometimes it happens occasionally 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.970
 I'm 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.330
 It is as a backup file Back 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:59.970
 It is a file attached 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:04.430
 Place is good you want to be certain it is when such a I think I might be this restoration 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:07.610
 It is possible to take this bag or you can say that extension 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:10.889
 It is Toka to restore raised taking the paper back 

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:18.139
 You will be able to do that too 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:18.139
 So it is convenient or Naa I think more and Well have extended
