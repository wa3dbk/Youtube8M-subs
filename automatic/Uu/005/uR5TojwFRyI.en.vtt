00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.980
 digital and recover your photos viviane reding import from 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.769
 food 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.769
 if you have many options 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.749
 in this sequence we'll see how to import photos from a 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.060
 digital camera 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 you have for that the possible is to go through brick I will then click 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.210
 here on the little icon to launch bricks 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 and when you're in brink you have here an all-option menu allows 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 especially and well to change the way you view your images here you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.500
 have different options 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.850
 here we recognize a small device icon and so I can get the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.649
 pictures of my digital camera 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.840
 that I just plugged into music 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.629
 you can even make sure that but in 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.490
 as soon as you plug in your camera 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.280
 and well bridge recognize it and propose that precisely the module we 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.680
 let's see together 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.440
 I click to their folder 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 I have a window that appears here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.970
 I'm going to box here the advanced dialogue since you see that for 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.190
 at the moment I have several options but on the other hand we do not see the images that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.650
 are on my device 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.040
 so in the advanced dialog we'll be able to do it 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.130
 move this one like this 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 and in fact and well all the images will appear below 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 but I have to get the device first 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.150
 I see laurent and dare digital that corresponds to my device I click 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.970
 above 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.580
 you'll see that automatically well I see all the sharp images 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.650
 representative 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.990
 the photos on the map 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.490
 so I already have a lot of information on all the photos components the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.050
 map 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.850
 weekdays g63 files that are displayed so g63 files 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 I can import from my card 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.240
 the set weighs 28 mega 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.440
 and all the shots were made between the 16th and the 24th 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.200
 then you have small squares that each have a little cross 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.900
 the inside telling me that all the photos for now are 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.060
 selected and that I will be able to import them all at once 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.180
 while I'm doing 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 we were missing a little bit my window 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.700
 and see that for the moment here I am in all selected and well if I 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.510
 wants to go really imported that some pictures I can here all of 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.669
 selected we know she confessed that all the boxes 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.279
 and I'm going now and well to choose them the pictures that I wish like 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.019
 for example this one 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.109
 this one 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.759
 down who can here 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.849
 I take this one 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.349
 after choosing the photos you want to import, you have to choose the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.529
 options then in these cases we have all the import options 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.729
 who are on the right 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.390
 first thing the location 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.390
 we will go here and in fact we will create them for example 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.060
 something sure 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.959
 the office we will go click here I create them 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.049
 to his file 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.049
 and this folder we will call it 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.599
 in this race folder 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.720
 one can also create on his record 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.570
 in these cases you will see that I will here put a custom name and 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.570
 causes them 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.269
 we can then decide to rename each file so it's the same 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 go here choose for example a custom word 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.930
 you will see that each time and well I have here the examples of what that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.599
 can give so I see that every time now I have on my desk a 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.009
 folder called bear 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.209
 a subfolder called 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.100
 ourse zot 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.390
 and now in my example well I'm going to name here every time every 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.279
 photo every image that I imported by 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.679
 00 ap 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.569
 the second pole will be 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.010
 who was shaving rousset road 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.209
 eq it was with his peers 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.579
 we have then and well 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.609
 advanced options here we will not go back too much 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.489
 in detail 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.820
 you could for example save a copy in another folder 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.079
 to converts to images 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.279
 in dng format which is the format proposed by hadopi 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:46.120
 I am going here 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.789
 click his fiance to close the window 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.979
 I think it was fine apply basic metadata so that's 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:52.400
 really 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.659
 small metadata like creator and copyright poupaud and 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.699
 put for example here 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.159
 anthony 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.980
 in the copyright is a copyright of the photographer who has 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.439
 conducted 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.029
 if you do not want to apply metadata 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.049
 you can befied 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.429
 click on that 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:08.739
 you could possible 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.870
 to fill in much more accurate metadata and do it well 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.649
 directly into bridge afterwards 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.689
 so once you've done well we do all that and you have to all are 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.479
 ready to be carried away 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.859
 you click on get photos 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.009
 so far you see that the photos are the scope the window is closing 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.029
 the photos I just imported 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.669
 we can notice that each of my photos heiter 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.439
 renowned 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.060
 and kurt she's good on my desk 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.189
 in the race folder and in the subfolder for this jump 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.869
 I can subsequently and well selected for example but four 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:46.400
 images and open them with a double click to open them in photoshop is 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.259
 automatically 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.259
 I will find my images in photoshop 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.700
 ap why
