00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
I think that is a strength very very odd

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.620 
I think that is a strength very very odd
and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.140 
and
yeah<00:03:26.350> that's<00:03:26.590> very<00:03:26.650> strange

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
yeah that's very strange

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.430 
yeah that's very strange
um

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
um

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.400 
um

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
so we're seeing like individual orbs are

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.660 
so we're seeing like individual orbs are
seeing<00:03:33.650> tons<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.070> orders<00:03:36.370> there<00:03:39.430> well<00:03:40.430> George
