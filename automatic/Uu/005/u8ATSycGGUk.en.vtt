 the students of the 10 Oct and we nested it until one wonders what was going on there 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.400
 and I think I know the feeling too vague one should speak pace 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.800
 slow down significantly 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.539

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.309
 I like Bavaria so maybe I can handle more

 more 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.549
 Hannover is not in prospect 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.489
 Minute could have spoken I go with the Saxon dialect there 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.549
 nothing better 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.800
 I'm sure not looking for it 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 After that, I would not be the maker of the Saxon dialect 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.409
 and is a linguistic imposition 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.359
 Food she would not have done 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 everything just fantastic dream final 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.859
 So I do not like the Saxon dialect this is 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.119

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.729
 I think it's cool 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 compliment or sweet talk 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.210

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.740

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.100
 only what the youngest here is asking for 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.110
 that would make me happy 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.710
 as I said food dpa 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.900
 first an early comment 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 but that only guess bounced 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.060
 the problem of a war was said in comments much not play anymore 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.409

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.479
 all people should use customers 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.689
 so they had to tinker on the title 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
 I hope that the maize helps us to become usable 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.439
 stay 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.689
 I do not just want to start I like these animals 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.689

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.599
 very nice 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:49.330
 the problem may remain until the middle of next week, of course it can us 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.559
 do not remember too hard 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.389

 the division Concessions 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.499
 is exciting 

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:34.499
 to enter 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.069
 next big goal is like that 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.790

 that's already sold 

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.749
 then you have to do without the whole of Cuba 

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.649
