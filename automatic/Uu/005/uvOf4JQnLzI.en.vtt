00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello everyone, Sanya, today I will show you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.560
 new build windows 10 on the phone and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 now you can see the list 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
 how he contacts so very much 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.920
 changed and it seems to me for the better 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 even though it looked a bit like a with this 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 its icons round but still it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.180
 It was very nice here these letters is 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 also very beautiful as message 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 with the same rounds this is also very me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.680
 like the style of the same windows 10 straight 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 Exactly windows is not what it was 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.239
 earlier in raw assemblies that is all very 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 good so can you see 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 dealer, then there are some big figures 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 it is very good before 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 that small was something not very 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.450
 nicely outlook mail app added 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 I don't use it like that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.090
 mail dzhimile or Yandex here but who 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.520
 enjoys that really will 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.579
 interesting and very cool just see 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.039
 interface style already on all applications 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.369
 became a thread scrollable but on the side 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.479
 The same curtain as already android ios 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.060
 but that's okay Well now here it is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.890
 just beautiful everything i'm just on it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 I hope you see the settings here 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.220
 I am not showing this application 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 I use it and it is not very interesting 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 how can you get this pile 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.990
 under he generally whims 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 marked or how to delete it to the left here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 this is a plus hope in many 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.869
 applications it will be implemented 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 and I really like it also do 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.189
 calendar integration ie for all 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.600
 be some meetings there or something else 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.299
 that is, you shake it all shown in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.299

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.460

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.259
 same became so beautiful 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.439
 albeit very minimal but still 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.819
 will work even faster internet 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.849
 itâ€™s absolutely not interesting for them 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.030
 the main thing is that everything works and everyone 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.010
 it was good as I personally have these 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.080
 settings after taking into account that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.170
 give me nothing at all they can 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.420
 go that is so clean look 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.600
