00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.100
 hello and welcome to rethink 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 Today I want to show you how to get involved 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.359
 strawberry banana smoothie itself 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.460
 can produce 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.550
 for the smoothie you need about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.559
 500 grams strawberries a banana circa 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.280
 I would have 400 milliliters of orange juice 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 you are missing weeks 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.360
 one hundred percent so 100 percent 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.809
 to take fruit juice and orange juice 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:57.690
 a bit forest honey, yes first 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.210
 fixed that strawberry and put it in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.739
 smaller pieces 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 I have already done that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.659
 Banana just washed the fruit for me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 and have crushed all these things are 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.360
 in a stand mixer if someone is not a state 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 a blender has mashed city 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 is also sufficient so you there 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380
 now 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.870
 then there are only Japanese 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.560
 his juice 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.000
 So you do not really everything the same 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:54.590
 together so military orange juice 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 about 400 to 500 liters 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 I 'm making you too much and ending 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 the forest honey comes in again 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.060
 is also different so i do 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.550
 always two tablespoons that theoretically 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.550
 a tablespoon would be sufficient 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.959
 but that is depending on the taste so would be 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.200
 it's a sweeter sweet little sweetie 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.209
 Of course, mag can also be closer to that 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.239
 that it really and that hurts too 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.239
 Not 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.570
 2 so i always make two for that 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 it reaches me too and you can do that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.120
 Try it yourself if we are the sea 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 takes or less that every one for 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.990
 let it be when we put everything in the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:24.360
 stand mixer has filled which the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.900
 Next, know everything together 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.900
 between robbery 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:05.630
 has now know to be that until the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:09.020
 Fruits are so far right 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.020
 are gerierte 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.540
 that's how it is, he said 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.030
 it has to be finished already 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.630
 finish it now I show you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:59.470
 again I mean friends 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:05:03.120
 servier So therefore I would glass 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.120
 do not fully fill up now 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.210
 I am making a storm in and to 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.590
 Cover, I'll do one again 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.810
 since I'm the buyer name is only 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.729
 as it has to be done now 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.889
 so you can serve here 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:37.630
 You can still think twice 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:40.800
 what she now uses for decor as a deco 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.190
