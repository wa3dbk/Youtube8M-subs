bsp<00:02:51.220> that's<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.360> map<00:02:53.350> file<00:02:53.800> nav<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
bsp that's a a map file nav is the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.810 
bsp that's a a map file nav is the
navigation<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.800> bots<00:02:57.100> know<00:02:57.460> how<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
navigation so the bots know how to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.580 
navigation so the bots know how to
navigate<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.600> map<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.560> might<00:02:59.830> also<00:03:00.160> have

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
navigate the map you might also have

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.380 
navigate the map you might also have
folders<00:03:02.590> inside<00:03:03.130> those<00:03:03.490> zip<00:03:04.120> files

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
folders inside those zip files

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.380 
folders inside those zip files
containing<00:03:04.960> maps<00:03:05.730> materials<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.030> maybe

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
containing maps materials and maybe

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.920 
containing maps materials and maybe
sound<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.970> quite<00:03:10.480> self-explanatory

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
sound and it's quite self-explanatory

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.740 
sound and it's quite self-explanatory
you<00:03:11.800> put<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.250> maps<00:03:12.610> folder<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.360> maps

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you put the maps folder in the maps

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.810 
you put the maps folder in the maps
folder<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.580> deer<00:03:15.580> or<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.750> map<00:03:17.020> step<00:03:17.440> files<00:03:18.430> in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
folder the deer or the map step files in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.600 
folder the deer or the map step files in
the<00:03:19.090> maps<00:03:19.330> folder<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.800> materials

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the maps folder you put the materials

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.020 
the maps folder you put the materials
files<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.080> materials<00:03:23.740> folder<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.820> on

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
files in the materials folder and so on

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.610 
files in the materials folder and so on
so<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.960> could<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.650> select<00:03:27.070> those<00:03:27.520> free<00:03:27.910> and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
so I could just select those free and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.930 
so I could just select those free and
place<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.920> right<00:03:30.520> inside<00:03:31.110> my<00:03:32.110> maps<00:03:32.740> folder<00:03:33.430> and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
place it right inside my maps folder and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.050 
place it right inside my maps folder and
there<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:34.990> go<00:03:35.020> but<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.160> not<00:03:36.460> yet

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060

completed<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:38.500> installation<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:39.970> go

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
completed the installation you can go

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.920 
completed the installation you can go

see strike and right down here to map

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.630 
see strike and right down here to map
list<00:03:59.220> now<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.280> mat<00:04:00.670> list<00:04:00.940> tells<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.960> server

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
list now the mat list tells the server

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.110 
list now the mat list tells the server
which<00:04:03.640> maps<00:04:04.180> are<00:04:04.420> available<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:05.530> play<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:07.090> I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
which maps are available to play so I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.620 
which maps are available to play so I
need<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.810> add<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.490> map<00:04:09.490> i<00:04:09.670> installed<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
need to add the map i installed to the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.400 
need to add the map i installed to the
map<00:04:10.930> list<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.790> server<00:04:13.150> knows<00:04:13.660> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
map list so that this server knows that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.170 
map list so that this server knows that
this<00:04:15.250> map<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:16.090> installed<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.840> playable<00:04:17.650> and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
this map is installed and playable and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.110 
this map is installed and playable and
you<00:04:19.180> want<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.600> also<00:04:19.930> open<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.799> map<00:04:21.010> cycle<00:04:21.669> this

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
you want to also open the map cycle this

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.220 
you want to also open the map cycle this
is<00:04:22.330> how<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.540> server

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
is how the server

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.460 
is how the server
cycle<00:04:23.710> through<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.340> maps<00:04:24.780> unless<00:04:25.780> you<00:04:25.960> have<00:04:26.170> a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
cycle through the maps unless you have a

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.720 
cycle through the maps unless you have a
end<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:27.040> map<00:04:27.340> voting<00:04:28.240> system<00:04:29.220> which<00:04:30.220> source

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
end of map voting system which source

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.800 
end of map voting system which source
mod<00:04:31.080> has<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.530> want<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.860> use<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.420> just<00:04:34.420> check

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
mod has if you want to use it just check

mod has if you want to use it just check
my<00:04:35.020> source<00:04:35.830> mod<00:04:36.070> made<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.310> more<00:04:36.520> playlists<00:04:36.970> and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
my source mod made a more playlists and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.830 
my source mod made a more playlists and
and<00:04:38.430> yeah<00:04:39.430> go<00:04:39.640> through<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.390> will<00:04:40.600> find

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and yeah go through it and you will find

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.470 
and yeah go through it and you will find
how<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> activate<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.460> end<00:04:42.670> of<00:04:42.850> map<00:04:43.060> voting

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
how to activate the end of map voting

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.660 
how to activate the end of map voting
but<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.380> don't<00:04:44.590> have<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.430> how<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
but if you don't have it this is how the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.690 
but if you don't have it this is how the
server<00:04:49.210> cycles<00:04:49.840> through<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.710> map<00:04:50.920> so<00:04:51.220> if<00:04:51.460> we

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
server cycles through the map so if we

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.450 
server cycles through the map so if we
started<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.720> dust<00:04:53.050> once<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.100> map<00:04:54.280> is

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
started on the dust once the map is

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.080 
started on the dust once the map is
completed<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.210> will<00:04:55.540> change<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.350> Aztec<00:04:56.980> once<00:04:57.820> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
completed it will change to Aztec once a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.600 
completed it will change to Aztec once a
stick<00:04:58.360> is<00:04:58.480> completed<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.560> will<00:04:59.920> just<00:05:00.160> cycle

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
stick is completed it will just cycle

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.840 
stick is completed it will just cycle
through<00:05:00.640> them<00:05:01.030> one<00:05:01.480> by<00:05:01.540> one<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.770> just<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.670> make

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
through them one by one so just to make

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.780 
through them one by one so just to make
sure<00:05:03.880> that<00:05:04.480> everything<00:05:05.100> works<00:05:06.100> correctly<00:05:06.250> i'm

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
sure that everything works correctly i'm

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.350 
sure that everything works correctly i'm
going<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.150> add<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.810> name<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:09.160> map<00:05:09.730> cycle

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
going to add the name to the map cycle

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.850 
going to add the name to the map cycle
as<00:05:10.540> well<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.520> yeah<00:05:12.700> if<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.390> wanted<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:14.110> delete

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
as well so yeah if you wanted to delete
a<00:05:14.920> map<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:16.240> go<00:05:16.480> into<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.260> maps<00:05:17.530> folder

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
a map just go into the maps folder

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.690 
a map just go into the maps folder
delete<00:05:18.880> all<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.390> files<00:05:19.420> that<00:05:20.220> have<00:05:21.220> something
