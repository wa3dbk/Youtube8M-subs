00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.200
 90 000 people in the audience for gp 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:20.680
 motorcycling dutch who knows how to 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.869
 Most get there, there you go. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.029
 raining can be as cold as it gets 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 nobody leaves 20 bikes that is the biggest 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 parking lot I've seen in life 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.110
 the number of neighborhoods is also 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.110
 impressive 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.309
 and who was there accompanied the victory of 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.979
 valentino rossi that more than two years ago 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.089
 did not climb the top of the podium 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:48.489
 twisting the whole race pro valente 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.949
 an exciting test the most 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.869
 Traditional MotoGP here in Korea before 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.979
 of war but after the war began 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.690
 to 49 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.879
 the world speed championship in 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.309
 a speed has other countries that 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.199
 have had the race every year since 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.549
 first year in the world to germany 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:10.380
 Italy and France but is the same circuit 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 circuit only here in Holland only 500 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.950
 so on the stage of skill issues 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.950
 and overcoming 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.390
 the workouts alternation between floors 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.729
 wet and dry not your teams 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.890
 tire slick the rain tire and 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.539
 especially at the low temperature 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.490
 asphalt the tires mainly 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.369
 slick does not reach the ideal temperature 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.460
 to have the best flu for what it is 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.380
 of the pilot swim is losing grip and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.479
 can be injected in the last three 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 years lorenzo has not been lucky here. 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.549
 holland 2011 ride there later on 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.130
 the first round in 2012 the autistic 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.780
 first curve and now 2013 he fell in 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.789
 first day of training and reminded 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.409
 clavicle is out of the catholic classic 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.090
 also of the race leaving the dispute 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.099
 between marketing rich oil as 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.599
 that and if it rains it does not water extremely 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.580
 hard to hit they have to do 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.959
 two bikes a square dry for rain 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.390
 because the regulation is totally 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.430
 different you can see here the steel disk 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.470
 more conventional for wet floor 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.700
 because it can not overheat 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.459
 working at a suitable temperature 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.470
 to use that type of disc which is a 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.060
 carbon disk it gives you much more 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.609
 braking performance but he was 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.500
 a minimum temperature of 400 degrees 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.840
 so the rain bike is completely 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.450
 different from brake to suspension 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.799
 There has to be a softer rain tire. 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 totally different electronics so 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.519
 that the pilot when it starts to rain 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.799
 during the race there is no way to 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.079
 bike I have it for easier exchange 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.760
 motorcycle in the box than just changing the 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.209
 tire because it has nothing to do with a motorcycle 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.209
 with another 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.010
 so travel to barcelona the current 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.960
 world champion undergoes surgery 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.770
 places titanium plate and eight screws 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.900
 on the collarbone 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.790
 even with opponents training on Friday 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.080
 lorenzo remains among the top 12 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.850
 classification times 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.280
 surprise is the first pole of English 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.520
 cal crutchlow running with team 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.520
 satellite 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.810
 witty, he said that he was so 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:36.860
 happy how much ronaldo player to score 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:39.110
 a goal ronaldo a sliding project has 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.420
 in the motogp closet here and the big 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.550
 The feeling is of the law voting here to 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 track everyone excited 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.530
 one of the big bets is Valentino 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.560
 rossi in the last stage of the search to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 bike finally in its use not for motorcycle 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.940
 How was Florida sitting? 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.470
 is continuous and brother ghetto pulls 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.020
 Valentino says he was very 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.040
 confident that it has overtaken the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.180
 right time 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.610
 first about mark marques 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.310
 then up to dani pedrosa and reveals 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 he felt that his money 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:24.330
 Defeat the victory of the number 46 arrives 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.790
 exactly after a fast of 46 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.800
 without winning and accumulating one of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.700
 best races of the year I think 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.160
 best race of the year contest to amaze 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.900

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.900
 fifth place by lorenzo 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.779
 Jorge lorenzo cried in pain at the end of 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.879
 race and joy at not letting the 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.999
 opponents play on the table of 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.999
 ranking 

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.159
