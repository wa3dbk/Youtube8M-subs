the<00:03:46.520> editing<00:03:46.850> on<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.270> book<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.690> really<00:03:48.080> found

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
the editing on this book I really found

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.770 
the editing on this book I really found
that<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.770> book<00:03:48.980> jumps<00:03:49.430> around<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.850> lot<00:03:50.090> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
that this book jumps around a lot it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.720 
that this book jumps around a lot it
doesn't<00:03:51.110> seem<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.380> be<00:03:51.470> very<00:03:51.500> focused<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.460> think

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
doesn't seem to be very focused I think

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.140 
doesn't seem to be very focused I think
part<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.240> is<00:03:53.390> because<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:54.670> untold<00:03:55.670> story

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
part of that is because the untold story

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.230 
part of that is because the untold story
of<00:03:56.450> his<00:03:56.870> father<00:03:57.140> really<00:03:57.710> i<00:03:57.920> mean<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:58.640> i<00:03:58.910> were<00:03:58.940> to

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
of his father really i mean if i were to

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240 
of his father really i mean if i were to
ride<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.870> take<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.620> information<00:04:00.740> that<00:04:01.100> he

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
ride it and take the information that he

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.430 
ride it and take the information that he
puts<00:04:01.610> in<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:01.850> book<00:04:02.060> about<00:04:02.180> his<00:04:02.450> father<00:04:02.720> you

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
puts in this book about his father you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.830 
puts in this book about his father you
could<00:04:03.590> probably<00:04:03.830> put<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.570> i'm<00:04:05.630> going<00:04:05.750> to

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
could probably put it and i'm going to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.560 
could probably put it and i'm going to
be<00:04:05.900> conservative<00:04:06.320> here<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.040> very<00:04:08.000> generous

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
be conservative here and very generous

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.949 
be conservative here and very generous
you<00:04:09.170> can<00:04:09.350> probably<00:04:10.420> well<00:04:11.420> i<00:04:11.450> would<00:04:11.720> say<00:04:11.750> not

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
you can probably well i would say not

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.290 
you can probably well i would say not
conservative<00:04:12.530> just<00:04:12.709> very<00:04:12.890> generous<00:04:13.310> you

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
conservative just very generous you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.510 
conservative just very generous you
could<00:04:14.480> probably<00:04:14.690> put<00:04:15.080> his<00:04:15.350> father<00:04:15.770> story<00:04:16.280> on

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
could probably put his father story on

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.000 
could probably put his father story on
these<00:04:16.730> 50<00:04:17.180> pages<00:04:17.540> here<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.080> there<00:04:18.830> would<00:04:18.980> be

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
these 50 pages here and there would be

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.380 
these 50 pages here and there would be
no<00:04:19.250> need<00:04:19.280> for<00:04:19.520> this<00:04:19.850> part<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.570> book

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
no need for this part of the book

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.290 
no need for this part of the book
but<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.740> would<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.550> surprised<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.150> his

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
but really I would be surprised if his

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.450 
but really I would be surprised if his
father<00:04:25.510> story<00:04:25.960> actually<00:04:26.110> took<00:04:26.410> up<00:04:26.590> 50<00:04:26.920> pages<00:04:27.310> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
father story actually took up 50 pages I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.690 
father story actually took up 50 pages I
mean<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:28.830> guess<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:29.980> does<00:04:30.160> because<00:04:30.460> he's<00:04:30.580> got

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
mean I guess it does because he's got

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.420 
mean I guess it does because he's got
John<00:04:30.940> pictures<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.660> take<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:32.020> hold<00:04:32.230> pages<00:04:32.770> so

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
John pictures that take up hold pages so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.310 
John pictures that take up hold pages so
in<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.760> recipient<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.900> he's<00:04:37.900> based<00:04:38.140> a

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
in that recipient is so I he's based a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.500
