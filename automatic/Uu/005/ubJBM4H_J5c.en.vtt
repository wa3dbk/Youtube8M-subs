that's one for each amplifier because

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.980 
that's one for each amplifier because
these<00:05:17.010> are<00:05:17.190> mana<00:05:17.370> blocks<00:05:17.669> righty<00:05:18.000> yes<00:05:18.450> yeah<00:05:18.810> it

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
these are mana blocks righty yes yeah it

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.730 
these are mana blocks righty yes yeah it
wasn't<00:05:19.169> wanted
