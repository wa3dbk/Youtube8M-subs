beep<00:00:30.800> okay<00:00:31.800> there's<00:00:32.120> little<00:00:33.120> rates<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
beep okay there's little rates and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.869 
beep okay there's little rates and
there's<00:00:35.130> high<00:00:35.309> rates<00:00:37.070> now<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.399> back<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.730> low

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
there's high rates now go back to low

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.450 
there's high rates now go back to low
rates<00:00:39.559> then<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:41.250> flip<00:00:42.739> you<00:00:43.739> push<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
rates then to flip you push down on that

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
rates then to flip you push down on that
button<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.350> while<00:00:46.469> that's<00:00:46.649> beeping<00:00:47.989> it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
button and then while that's beeping it
will<00:00:49.170> flip<00:00:55.309> okay<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.940> turn<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.300> off

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
will flip okay I'm gonna turn that off

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040 
will flip okay I'm gonna turn that off
and<00:00:58.370> then<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.640> turn<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.270> okay<00:01:00.690> now

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.830 

okay

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
okay

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.090 
okay
and<00:01:09.840> blue<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.890> front<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> red<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> back

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.360 

I<00:01:16.409> mean<00:01:17.409> this<00:01:17.500> thing<00:01:17.740> it's<00:01:17.979> just<00:01:20.190> there<00:01:21.190> was<00:01:21.220> a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
I mean this thing it's just there was a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.630 
I mean this thing it's just there was a
flip<00:01:22.050> it<00:01:23.050> evidently<00:01:23.530> was<00:01:23.860> still<00:01:24.070> in<00:01:24.190> flip<00:01:24.430> mode

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
flip it evidently was still in flip mode

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.719 
flip it evidently was still in flip mode
from<00:01:24.970> when<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.450> had<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:26.020> before<00:01:26.530> I'm<00:01:27.460> gonna<00:01:27.610> do

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
from when I had it before I'm gonna do

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.200 
from when I had it before I'm gonna do
it<00:01:27.820> again<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.440> see<00:01:30.310> how<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.760> gains<00:01:30.970> altitude

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
it again and see how it gains altitude

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
it again and see how it gains altitude
just<00:01:31.780> before<00:01:32.080> he<00:01:32.170> flip

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.039 

which<00:01:36.670> i<00:01:36.820> think<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.119> neat<00:01:37.360> cuz<00:01:37.600> keeps<00:01:37.840> from

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
which i think is neat cuz keeps from

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.719 
which i think is neat cuz keeps from
flying<00:01:38.350> into<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.680> floor<00:01:38.860> especially<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.579> you're

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
flying into a floor especially if you're

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.230 
flying into a floor especially if you're
inside<00:01:41.220> okay<00:01:42.220> here<00:01:42.430> we<00:01:42.549> go<00:01:42.579> again<00:01:44.520> front<00:01:45.520> flip

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
inside okay here we go again front flip

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.770 
inside okay here we go again front flip
that's<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.380> neat<00:01:50.490> look<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.759> left

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.290 

black<00:01:57.780> flip<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.910> it's<00:02:00.180> pretty<00:02:00.750> sensitive<00:02:01.260> but

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
black flip and it's pretty sensitive but

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:11.160 
black flip and it's pretty sensitive but
it<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.480> absolutely<00:02:03.980> stable

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.160 

I<00:02:11.200> mean<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.010> really<00:02:12.340> stable<00:02:12.630> now<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.020> in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I mean it's really stable now this is in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.540 
I mean it's really stable now this is in
lower<00:02:14.350> rate<00:02:22.230> hope<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.470> thing<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.010> being

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
lower rate hope this thing is being

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.150 
lower rate hope this thing is being
caught<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:24.970> camera<00:02:28.290> okay<00:02:29.290> now<00:02:29.560> I'm<00:02:30.010> gonna

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
caught in the camera okay now I'm gonna

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.340 
caught in the camera okay now I'm gonna
go<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.460> middle<00:02:30.730> rates<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.930> only<00:02:35.140> real

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
go to middle rates the only real

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.830 
go to middle rates the only real
drawback<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.070> transmitter<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.480> small

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
drawback is the transmitter is so small

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.130 
drawback is the transmitter is so small
that<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.030> weird<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.660> my<00:02:40.870> big

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
that it's it's kind of weird in my big

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.840 
that it's it's kind of weird in my big
hands<00:02:46.080> okay<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.459> go

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
hands okay there we go

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.350 
hands okay there we go
middle<00:02:49.540> rates<00:02:49.750> now<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.550> see<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> lot

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
middle rates now as you see it's a lot

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.140 
middle rates now as you see it's a lot
more<00:02:53.190> responsive<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.790> flip

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
more responsive but now it will not flip

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.320 
more responsive but now it will not flip
unless<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.780> hit<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.050> flip<00:02:59.290> button<00:03:00.120> okay<00:03:01.120> now

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
unless you hit the flip button okay now

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.470 
unless you hit the flip button okay now
we're<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.720> high<00:03:01.930> rates<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.880> there's<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
we're in high rates and there's all the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.580 
we're in high rates and there's all the
way<00:03:05.850> full<00:03:06.850> stick<00:03:07.180> deflection<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:08.380> just

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
way full stick deflection it's just

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.870 
way full stick deflection it's just
really<00:03:08.830> really<00:03:09.100> sensitive<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:12.280> flying<00:03:12.580> it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
really really sensitive I like flying it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.479 
really really sensitive I like flying it
really<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.350> low<00:03:14.560> rates<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:17.190> up<00:03:19.170> okay

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
really in the low rates and up okay

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.870 
really in the low rates and up okay
transmitter<00:03:21.489> how's<00:03:21.730> about<00:03:23.160> about<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> 50<00:03:24.670> foot

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
transmitter how's about about a 50 foot

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:47.340 
transmitter how's about about a 50 foot
range<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.380> landed<00:03:29.799> straight<00:03:29.920> up

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.360 

pretty<00:03:48.040> cool<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.460> quad<00:03:52.920> ok<00:03:53.920> now<00:03:54.070> I'll<00:03:54.190> go

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
pretty cool little quad ok now I'll go

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.830 
pretty cool little quad ok now I'll go
middle<00:03:54.640> rights<00:03:54.850> do<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> little<00:03:55.300> speed<00:03:55.540> running

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
middle rights do a little speed running

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:10.470 
middle rights do a little speed running
okay<00:03:59.640> now<00:04:00.640> go<00:04:00.880> high<00:04:01.030> rates<00:04:03.990> whoops<00:04:07.890> okay<00:04:09.450> now<00:04:10.450> I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
okay now go high rates whoops okay now I
