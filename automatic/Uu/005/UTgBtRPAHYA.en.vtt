 we have to do is go to the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.070
 next page because gts point usa 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.500
 in the description of the file I am 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.030
 leaving a file in mediafire that 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.880

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.680
 we go back to the poker page etc 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.110
 we select where it says blake pokemon and 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.310
 we select fourth generation 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.990
 since this serves for all these 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.290
 pearl diamond platinum versions 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.120

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.300
 examine and select the file 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.729
 downloaded in this case is here 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.270
 selection we select sailing point 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.070
 small and we put the submit button to 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.630
 then we have to configure this 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.630
 number of our lying president 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.320
 we need to fire in this case I'm not going 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.320
 to do 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.920
 the version 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.810
 here gold 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.710
 and we use where it says 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.780
 configuration of the cw efe de intel 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.799
 just wifi settings 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.450
 we select the connection that we have 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.899
 internet and in my case this connection 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899
 one 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.620
 my retina the application am home is what 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.900
 next thing we do is go down and go 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.610
 where it says get automatic get from 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.610
 we automatically put that not 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.990
 and here we copy the number that we have 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.990
 record the following on the screen 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.570
 s tn s we've seen on the screen 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.570
 let's copy 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.830
 okay 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.830
 in this case it is 204 45 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.410
 in that secondary we put the same 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.860
 with the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.960
 we accept we keep adjustments 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.880
 a return 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.810
 come back and once done this will come back to 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.810
 load the game 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.569
 nothing 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.349
 we enter 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.349
 we can continue 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.030
 what we have to do is to address 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.310
 The gts is for all versions of 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.120
 fourth generation exist and maintain the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.280
 Plain symbol and simple 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.599
 he asks himself to remind them that they have 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.629
 have your team 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.629
 please I do not know 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.040
 because it makes better leaders 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.770
 like an omelet 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.290
 now I have to do six races 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.010
 so I'm a partner with a little more 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.010
 Science 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.620
 yes 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.510
 in this course do not leave fervor and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.160
 simplicity in diamond for the stage 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.410
 we go to the external simply to loans 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.680
 to reload the game and we 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.419
 we go to the box 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.419
 to the piece of the house for me 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.240
 so they do justice downloads a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.240
 little bit 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.789
 because like you 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.540
 and how we feel 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.540
 m 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.000
 and as we see that we are at a point by 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.000
 side 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.110
 like many grosos for the study 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.110
 positive person
