00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 This video is made specifically for 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.230
 site macro gift point ru 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.790
 thanks to the poppies store 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.270
 no for submitting review 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.270
 gadgets 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 in front of you is a brand new iphone 5s from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.269
 apple we remove the top cover of the box 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 and immediately the gadget appears before us 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.490
 it is made in black 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 or what apple calls space gray 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300
 the color is immediately visible which is different from 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.670
 iphone 5 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.430
 and the second difference that immediately rushes 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.489
 us eyes this home button around which 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.449
 now a small circle and on the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 home button now there is no square 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.969
 let's see what he looks like 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 the truth is very good and I think we will postpone 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 it is aside so far and see what u 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.469
 we have in the boxes in the box on immediately 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.109
 The trough lies on which the iphone was kept 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.140
 directly 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.910
 documentation in which the paperclip and any 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 operating instructions 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.510
 and nakleechki all of us loved I think 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 it is also not yet set aside more in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 we have a lightning cable in the box 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.080
 which comes with all new 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 Apple Gadgets 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 European plug most common for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.000
 charging and earphone earpods 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.980
 which is all of us loved too but I 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 I think, too, while we set aside aside 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.170
 box and see what is the very background of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.630
 he does not represent himself yet 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.690
 activated so let's see the outside 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 the difference is 2 diode flash new 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.090
 the camera is more accurate as new with on the outside 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 Mind you can immediately determine that it is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.100
 slightly different from iphone 5 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.720
 if you compare the background itself completely 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.690
 repeats its dimensions 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.390
 predecessor both the screen and 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.030
 thick like that but i think we 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.370
 while we activate and then already to you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 come back here before us appeared 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.980
 activated iphone 5s wanna tell you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.410
 immediately that it works very smoothly and 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.010
 Now I'll show you what people are for 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.970
 do not take and want to take iphone 5s 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.330
 this is a new fingerprint scanner 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.120
 first we will enable the password we will enter in 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.960
 2580 here we repeat it and turn 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 Immediately to the tab prints as soon as we 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.700
 it opened click on add 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.430
 imprint and now we are asked to place 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.730
 finger in the zone in which is located as 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.940
 tachachi sensor itself so that our finger 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.140
 our fingerprint could 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.020
 scan now we are asked to do 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.720
 this again we put our finger only 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.980
 already a little different angle 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.090
 iphone completely with scanned our 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 imprint and we can click on next 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.300
 now we are blocking our phone 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.830
 unlock it and asks immediately 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.320
 enter the password that is if we will 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.560
 putting our finger on the button is simple 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.810
 so it does not unlock it only 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.350
 after the first time we have to lead our 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.240
 password here we just entered it 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.240
 we block the phone and now 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.930
 when unlocking the phone we can 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.790
 use our finger everything works 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.269
 perfectly fine i will show it to you 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.080
 one more time we put our finger and here 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:33.220
 did our iphone unlock itself 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.459
 Axis on Hades new iPhone works really 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 very smoothly felt a7 processor 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.660
 new 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.310
 in terms of how it really works 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.040
 very quickly you now I am for you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.010
 comparison show new iphone 5s with 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.110
 old iphone 5 black here 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.040
 to the naked eye you can see that 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.780
 iphone 5s have two flashes and a little bit 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.480
 different body color 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.560
 iphone 5s it looks a little 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.180
 more pleasant 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.540
 that is, I would even say a little 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.940
 more expensive from the front can be immediately 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.040
 to distinguish iphone 5 from iphone 5s by button 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.100
 home as there is no square on it 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.560
 which we are accustomed to all and I want you 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.169
 say about the new camera first with 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.540
 loxgreen it opens very quickly 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.580
 well, really very quickly and the second is that she 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.930
 hyper clear she is very good 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.930
 taking pictures 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.710
 Here in our office I tried in the dark 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 take a picture and iphone is very good 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.600
 spoke about it all and very 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.850
 made a nice frame 2 that I really don't 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.720
 I liked it that it still lags 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.949
 spotlight 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.039
 Apparently in this regard the processor does not play 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.560
 roles and this is exactly the bug of the system but how 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.860
 system as in itself let's say the same 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.449
 very settings and in 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.060
 but if matched to put this 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.530
 with new a7 processor 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.560
 it works really really very fast 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.840
 like from syria which is actually something 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.470
 that she went out of trouble status and it is very 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.599
 impact of that in terms of how to 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.389
 what accent you would say 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.570
 you didn't say anything bad siri anyway 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.960
 understand it, I assure you the main thing to know 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.220
 some basic commands are also very 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.440
 works well multitasking panels 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.590
 I really liked it here 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.289
 Does not slow down at all if on my iPhone 5 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.539
 it slows down there and it is real 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.520
 very cool and the last thing you want 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.409
 tell you about how it works 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.250
 touch di sensor to enter password in 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:41.169
 Appstore for this go to the tab 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.669
 prints and tick opposite 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.520
 itunes and appstore 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.419
 drop-down box we enter your password from 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:56.259
 apple store and click on ok now we 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:58.509
 go to the apple store and download 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:02.710
 absolutely any groom that we already have 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:05.680
 was not purchased in advance we move into 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.530
 Search tab and enter for example subway 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.340
 surfers but since owls service I have 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.430
 already bought we download south surfers i 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:19.419
 no idea what this game is but attach 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.970
 finger we buy it here we download 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:25.479
 went and everything works really very 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.680
 fast and super clear loading 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.480
 goes this we can see 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.990
 Now we will block our phone and 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.690
 put next to him again iphone 5 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.650
 and now you can clearly see 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.720
 the difference between these two phones is 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.090
