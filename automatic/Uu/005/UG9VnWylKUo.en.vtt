drive the International for those that
are<00:05:48.780> wondering<00:05:48.870> why<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.200> haven't<00:05:49.410> been<00:05:49.560> using

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
are wondering why I haven't been using

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.860 
are wondering why I haven't been using
it<00:05:50.100> I've<00:05:50.850> been<00:05:51.090> using<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.510> because<00:05:51.570> it's

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
it I've been using it because it's

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.460 
it I've been using it because it's
absolutely<00:05:52.940> beyond<00:05:53.940> worthless<00:05:54.600> on<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.200> snow

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
absolutely beyond worthless on the snow

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.750 
absolutely beyond worthless on the snow
and<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.100> ice<00:05:56.130> but<00:05:58.010> so<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.040> just<00:05:59.310> parked<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.669> in

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
and the ice but so I just parked it in

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.270 
and the ice but so I just parked it in
the<00:05:59.820> shed<00:06:00.150> along<00:06:01.140> with<00:06:01.320> some<00:06:01.470> other<00:06:01.590> projects

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
the shed along with some other projects

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.310 
the shed along with some other projects
and<00:06:02.490> when<00:06:03.210> it<00:06:03.300> warms<00:06:03.479> up<00:06:03.780> then<00:06:03.960> we'll<00:06:04.080> start

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
and when it warms up then we'll start

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.659 
and when it warms up then we'll start
driving<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.770> comes<00:06:05.010> we've<00:06:05.250> got<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.460> get<00:06:05.550> it

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
driving it comes we've got to get it

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.860 
driving it comes we've got to get it
converted<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.150> 12<00:06:06.479> volt<00:06:06.919> and<00:06:08.630> still<00:06:09.630> got<00:06:09.780> to

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
converted to 12 volt and still got to

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.420 
converted to 12 volt and still got to
get<00:06:09.930> it<00:06:10.050> converted<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.530> 12<00:06:10.800> volt<00:06:11.010> really

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
get it converted to 12 volt really

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.670 
get it converted to 12 volt really
that's<00:06:11.610> about<00:06:11.820> it<00:06:12.110> before<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.140> go<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.470> start

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
that's about it before I go and start

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.940 
that's about it before I go and start
granted<00:06:14.010> in<00:06:14.280> town<00:06:14.640> I'll<00:06:14.850> probably<00:06:15.030> do<00:06:15.240> a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
granted in town I'll probably do a

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.350 
granted in town I'll probably do a
alignment<00:06:16.950> or<00:06:17.100> something<00:06:17.460> like<00:06:18.090> that<00:06:18.150> but
