00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
year and you tie the remaining hair into

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
year and you tie the remaining hair into
a<00:00:35.820> second<00:00:36.239> ponytail<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:37.290> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> start<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a second ponytail you want to start on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
a second ponytail you want to start on
the<00:00:38.340> braid<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> exact<00:00:39.510> same

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the braid so it's the exact same

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.040 
the braid so it's the exact same
technique<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.530> before<00:00:41.450> start<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> front

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
technique as before start at the front

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770 
technique as before start at the front
take<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> small<00:00:44.219> section<00:00:44.690> going<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.809> diagonal

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
take a small section going in diagonal

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:05.189 
take a small section going in diagonal
ways

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.380 

as<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.039> do<00:01:06.219> this<00:01:06.250> more<00:01:06.729> you'll<00:01:07.000> eventually

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
as you do this more you'll eventually

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.450 
as you do this more you'll eventually
speed<00:01:08.200> up<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.380> once<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.680> reach<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.039> end<00:01:12.070> you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
speed up so once you reach the end you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.310 
speed up so once you reach the end you
want<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.670> temporarily<00:01:13.090> secure<00:01:13.719> with<00:01:14.200> an

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
want to temporarily secure with an

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.440 
want to temporarily secure with an
elastic<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:15.130> because<00:01:16.030> you'll<00:01:16.149> be<00:01:16.240> coming

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
elastic and because you'll be coming

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.450 
elastic and because you'll be coming
back<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:16.869> later<00:01:17.079> on<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.920> want<00:01:18.369> to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
back to this later on so you want to

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.669 
back to this later on so you want to
release<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.060> top<00:01:19.210> section<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.990> hair<00:01:20.200> take

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
release the top section of hair take

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.580 
release the top section of hair take
your<00:01:20.860> comb<00:01:21.159> again<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:23.700> we'll<00:01:24.700> say<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.130 
right of the eyebrow and all the way
back<00:01:32.200> let's<00:01:33.009> say<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:37.479> going<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.630> try<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.840> get

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
back let's say I'm going to try and get

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.330 
back let's say I'm going to try and get
a<00:01:38.289> nice<00:01:38.729> line<00:01:39.729> as<00:01:40.060> possible<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.220> is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
a nice line as possible and this is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.370 
a nice line as possible and this is
going<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.670> your<00:01:42.789> new<00:01:42.849> section<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.450> hair<00:01:43.689> you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
going to be your new section of hair you

furthest point of the diagonal section

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.380 
furthest point of the diagonal section
apparent<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.489> don't<00:01:57.520> want<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.939> start<00:01:58.119> with

braid you want to start with the
farthest<00:02:01.569> away<00:02:01.689> one<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.250> again<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.819> exact

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
farthest away one so again the exact

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.029 
farthest away one so again the exact
same<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.780> time<00:02:08.079> we're<00:02:08.500> not<00:02:08.679> going<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.950> be

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
same and this time we're not going to be

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.129 
same and this time we're not going to be
braiding<00:02:09.429> along<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.030> hairline<00:02:10.209> we're<00:02:10.989> going

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.139 
braiding along the hairline we're going

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.080 
braiding along the hairline we're going
to<00:02:11.230> be<00:02:11.319> going<00:02:11.620> back<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> diagonal<00:02:12.489> like<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to be going back in a diagonal like this

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.199 
to be going back in a diagonal like this
so<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.230> sure<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.500> readjust<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.609> hair<00:02:15.880> as

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209
