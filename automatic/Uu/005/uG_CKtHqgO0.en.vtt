00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
make sure you know that at and they'll

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.960 
make sure you know that at and they'll
only<00:04:18.229> use<00:04:18.350> one<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.950> these<00:04:19.190> seats<00:04:19.489> masters

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
only use one of these seats masters

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.200 
only use one of these seats masters
things<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.229> we<00:04:21.560> use<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.979> two<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.060> are

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
things and we use to two of the are

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.060 
things and we use to two of the are
actual<00:04:23.690> reference<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.680> you'll<00:04:24.889> get<00:04:25.010> your

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
actual reference and you'll get your

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.129 
actual reference and you'll get your
superior<00:04:25.639> ones<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:28.040> if<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.580> I'm<00:04:29.419> not<00:04:29.479> entirely

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
superior ones so if we I'm not entirely

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.719 
superior ones so if we I'm not entirely
sure<00:04:30.320> which<00:04:30.620> one<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.160> best

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
sure which one is the best

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.870 
sure which one is the best
like<00:04:31.910> which<00:04:32.090> kind<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:33.400> blueprint<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.580> best

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
like which kind of blueprint is the best

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.610 
like which kind of blueprint is the best
for<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.710> but<00:04:38.169> they<00:04:39.169> do<00:04:39.229> make<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.039> something

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
for this but they do make you something

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.400 
for this but they do make you something
so<00:04:42.610> yeah<00:04:42.910> I'll<00:04:43.120> probably<00:04:43.270> do<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.230> for<00:04:44.290> a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so yeah I'll probably do this just for a

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.140 
so yeah I'll probably do this just for a
little<00:04:44.620> bit<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.950> I'll<00:04:45.310> probably<00:04:45.550> cut<00:04:45.970> the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
little bit and I'll probably cut the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.330 
little bit and I'll probably cut the
video<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:49.240> when<00:04:49.540> I'm<00:04:49.660> done<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:50.950> I'll<00:04:51.130> see<00:04:51.310> you

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
video to when I'm done so I'll see you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.940 
video to when I'm done so I'll see you
then<00:04:51.580> okay<00:04:54.420> so<00:04:55.420> that<00:04:55.690> was<00:04:55.810> our<00:04:55.900> last<00:04:56.050> one<00:04:56.380> and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
then okay so that was our last one and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.240 
then okay so that was our last one and
we've<00:04:57.550> got<00:04:57.700> them<00:04:57.820> all<00:04:57.940> here<00:04:57.970> now<00:04:59.010> so<00:05:00.010> we've<00:05:00.100> got

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
we've got them all here now so we've got

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.540 
we've got them all here now so we've got
these<00:05:00.430> twelve<00:05:01.020> superior<00:05:02.020> catapults<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.890> see

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
these twelve superior catapults and see

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.460 
these twelve superior catapults and see
a<00:05:03.580> magazine<00:05:03.940> show<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.480> blueprint<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.200> if<00:05:05.350> we

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
a magazine show on blueprint so if we

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.970 
a magazine show on blueprint so if we
sell<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:06.610> sell<00:05:06.820> it's<00:05:06.970> trading<00:05:07.210> posts<00:05:07.980> and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
sell this we sell it's trading posts and

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.660 
sell this we sell it's trading posts and
as<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.310> can<00:05:09.430> see<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:10.030> arm<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:12.430> could

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
as you can see that arm that we could

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.160 
as you can see that arm that we could
sell<00:05:12.880> it<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.450> I<00:05:13.690> probably<00:05:13.900> will

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
sell it for that and I probably will

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.100 
sell it for that and I probably will
this<00:05:14.350> for<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.620> purposes<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.220> video<00:05:16.110> but

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
this for the purposes of this video but

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.080 
this for the purposes of this video but
you<00:05:17.170> can<00:05:17.230> actually<00:05:17.700> sell<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:18.790> for<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:18.940> little

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
you can actually sell it for a little

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.080 
you can actually sell it for a little
higher<00:05:19.530> price<00:05:20.530> because<00:05:21.040> people<00:05:21.670> will<00:05:21.910> buy<00:05:22.060> it

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
higher price because people will buy it

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.410 
higher price because people will buy it
that's<00:05:22.690> just<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.230> lowest<00:05:23.410> kind<00:05:23.980> of<00:05:24.100> pile<00:05:24.420> or

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
that's just the lowest kind of pile or

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.540 
that's just the lowest kind of pile or
the<00:05:25.450> highest<00:05:25.690> buy<00:05:26.020> or<00:05:26.230> so<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:27.250> know<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.430> will

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
the highest buy or so you know you will

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.840 
the highest buy or so you know you will
sell<00:05:27.760> for<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:30.250> that's<00:05:30.400> automatically

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
sell for that so that's automatically

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.100 
sell for that so that's automatically
giving<00:05:31.120> us<00:05:31.210> quite<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.420> bit<00:05:31.480> of<00:05:31.630> money<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.020> we

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
giving us quite a bit of money and we

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.590 
giving us quite a bit of money and we
can<00:05:32.830> sell<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.310> rest<00:05:33.340> these<00:05:33.730> time<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.300> do<00:05:34.420> some

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
can sell the rest these time to do some

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.320 
can sell the rest these time to do some
real<00:05:34.780> damage<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:38.640> all<00:05:39.640> right<00:05:39.730> so<00:05:40.000> that'll

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
real damage and all right so that'll

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.810 
real damage and all right so that'll
automatically<00:05:40.990> make<00:05:41.530> us<00:05:41.740> money<00:05:42.160> but<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.760> think

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
automatically make us money but I think

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.600 
automatically make us money but I think
we<00:05:43.120> do<00:05:43.300> want<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.630> do<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:43.960> little<00:05:44.170> more<00:05:44.470> on<00:05:45.430> these

all<00:06:39.639> sold<00:06:39.969> so<00:06:40.389> it's<00:06:41.319> pretty<00:06:41.529> good<00:06:41.709> yeah<00:06:42.429> and<00:06:43.139> if

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
all sold so it's pretty good yeah and if

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.199 
all sold so it's pretty good yeah and if
the<00:06:44.259> demand<00:06:44.559> isn't<00:06:44.979> that<00:06:45.129> high<00:06:45.399> at<00:06:45.879> the<00:06:45.999> time

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:46.209 
the demand isn't that high at the time

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:47.669 
the demand isn't that high at the time
that<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.539> sell<00:06:46.779> them<00:06:46.959> you<00:06:47.169> can<00:06:47.289> always<00:06:47.409> just

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:47.679 
that you sell them you can always just

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.589 
that you sell them you can always just
leave<00:06:48.069> it<00:06:48.249> overnight<00:06:48.490> and<00:06:48.639> I'm<00:06:49.149> sure<00:06:49.389> they

leave it overnight and I'm sure they

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.759 
leave it overnight and I'm sure they
sold<00:06:50.289> by<00:06:50.499> then<00:06:51.039> so<00:06:51.929> yeah<00:06:52.929> so<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.139> got<00:06:53.349> on<00:06:53.499> the

all the ingredients from it from the
Trading<00:06:58.839> Post<00:06:58.869> so<00:06:59.349> you<00:06:59.979> can<00:07:00.099> imagine<00:07:00.279> you'd

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
Trading Post so you can imagine you'd

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.679 
Trading Post so you can imagine you'd
probably<00:07:00.939> be<00:07:01.419> getting<00:07:02.579> at<00:07:03.579> least<00:07:03.639> three<00:07:04.389> gold

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:04.689 
probably be getting at least three gold

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.389 
probably be getting at least three gold
if<00:07:04.990> you<00:07:05.199> just<00:07:05.769> use<00:07:06.009> your<00:07:06.189> own<00:07:06.339> items<00:07:07.139> but<00:07:08.139> um

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:08.399 
if you just use your own items but um

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.689 
if you just use your own items but um
yes<00:07:09.399> so<00:07:10.229> there's<00:07:11.229> that<00:07:11.409> and<00:07:11.709> so<00:07:12.309> yeah<00:07:12.519> I<00:07:12.550> just

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
yes so there's that and so yeah I just

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.730 
yes so there's that and so yeah I just
bought<00:07:12.999> it<00:07:13.059> myself<00:07:13.360> and<00:07:13.839> I'm<00:07:14.110> sure<00:07:14.409> that<00:07:14.649> you

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
bought it myself and I'm sure that you

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.319 
bought it myself and I'm sure that you
could<00:07:14.860> probably<00:07:15.069> figure<00:07:15.429> it<00:07:15.610> out<00:07:15.849> a<00:07:15.879> better

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:16.329 
could probably figure it out a better

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:19.859 
could probably figure it out a better
way<00:07:16.449> than<00:07:16.899> what<00:07:17.800> I<00:07:17.829> did<00:07:18.159> by<00:07:18.339> like<00:07:18.669> by<00:07:19.539> making

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:19.869 
way than what I did by like by making

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:21.899 
way than what I did by like by making
sure<00:07:19.899> that<00:07:20.349> and<00:07:20.529> actually<00:07:20.709> like<00:07:21.009> finding<00:07:21.879> the

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:21.909 
sure that and actually like finding the

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.509 
sure that and actually like finding the
optimal<00:07:22.360> way<00:07:22.479> to<00:07:22.539> get<00:07:22.779> the<00:07:22.839> money<00:07:22.959> but<00:07:23.519> just

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:24.519 
optimal way to get the money but just

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:26.459 
optimal way to get the money but just
from<00:07:24.789> doing<00:07:24.939> what<00:07:25.269> I<00:07:25.300> did<00:07:25.599> there<00:07:25.809> I<00:07:26.019> got<00:07:26.289> that

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:26.469 
from doing what I did there I got that

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:28.559 
from doing what I did there I got that
so<00:07:26.979> yeah<00:07:27.159> you<00:07:27.219> could<00:07:27.369> probably<00:07:27.550> do<00:07:28.209> it<00:07:28.360> with

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:28.569 
so yeah you could probably do it with

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:29.909 
so yeah you could probably do it with
only<00:07:28.809> the<00:07:29.110> golems<00:07:29.439> because<00:07:29.649> I<00:07:29.709> think<00:07:29.769> that

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
only the golems because I think that

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.009 
only the golems because I think that
worked<00:07:30.189> out<00:07:30.339> a<00:07:30.369> little<00:07:30.550> better

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:31.019 
worked out a little better

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.379 
worked out a little better
