at<00:01:12.270> Saratoga<00:01:12.960> excuse<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.680> Keeneland

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
at Saratoga excuse me was at Keeneland

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.140 
at Saratoga excuse me was at Keeneland
when<00:01:14.130> he<00:01:14.189> won<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.760> Keeneland<00:01:15.060> then

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when he won that one in Keeneland then

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
when he won that one in Keeneland then
he<00:01:15.210> went<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> Breeders<00:01:15.840> Cup<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.290> finished

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
he went to the Breeders Cup and finished

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
he went to the Breeders Cup and finished
a<00:01:16.830> decent<00:01:17.189> second<00:01:17.580> nosing<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.210> start<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a decent second nosing out up start and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660 
a decent second nosing out up start and
I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.470> he<00:01:19.590> could<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.009> he<00:01:20.159> goes<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
I think he could if he goes back to that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.920 
I think he could if he goes back to that
Keeneland<00:01:21.060> race<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.689> walked

prepping for his seasonal debut here
pretty<00:01:41.340> soon<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.119> he's<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.360> good

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
pretty soon and I think he's in good

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
pretty soon and I think he's in good
shape<00:01:42.570> trying<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> keep<00:01:43.500> his<00:01:44.100> armor<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
shape trying to keep his armor and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.969 
shape trying to keep his armor and
brother<00:01:44.850> Kent<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> don't<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
brother Kent and I don't see that as a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
brother Kent and I don't see that as a
fluke<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> good<00:01:47.759> performance<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
fluke that was a good performance in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.850 
fluke that was a good performance in the
Breeders<00:01:48.570> Cup<00:01:48.600> Juvenile<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.229> he<00:01:49.350> beat<00:01:49.710> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
Breeders Cup Juvenile but he beat that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.530 
Breeders Cup Juvenile but he beat that
field<00:01:50.100> fair<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.490> square<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> day

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
field fair and square I think that day

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.660 
field fair and square I think that day
just<00:01:52.409> remains<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:52.950> seen<00:01:53.250> whether<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.549> can

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just remains to be seen whether he can

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.550 
just remains to be seen whether he can
transfer<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.450> form<00:01:54.689> over<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.079> his<00:01:55.170> three<00:01:55.409> all

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
transfer that form over to his three all
