so we are back in the game all logged in
now<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.290> probably<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.680> you're

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
now and this is probably what you're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
now and this is probably what you're
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:52.979> looking<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.540> basically

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to be looking at just it basically

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
going to be looking at just it basically
nothing<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.130> looking<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
nothing you're going to be looking at a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.670 
nothing you're going to be looking at a
wall<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> turn<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.259> mount<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
wall so go ahead and turn your mount is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.050 
wall so go ahead and turn your mount is
probably<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.130> turned<00:01:59.399> around<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.790> well

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
probably gonna be turned around as well

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.990 
probably gonna be turned around as well
go<00:02:00.600> ahead<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.780> turn<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.320> i<00:02:01.409> highly<00:02:01.649> suggest

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
go ahead and turn and i highly suggest

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
go ahead and turn and i highly suggest
putting<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> RP<00:02:03.810> walk<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> haven't

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
putting on the RP walk if you haven't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
putting on the RP walk if you haven't
changed<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.189> key<00:02:05.490> bindings<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
changed your key bindings for it it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.859 
changed your key bindings for it it
should<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.469> slash<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.729> number<00:02:09.030> pad<00:02:09.239> so

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
should be the slash on the number pad so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.190 
should be the slash on the number pad so
go<00:02:10.110> ahead<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.319> put<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
go ahead and put that on and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.470 
go ahead and put that on and
then<00:02:11.290> hit<00:02:11.800> space<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.280> go<00:02:12.400> up<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.420> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
then hit space to go up and then this is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.020 
then hit space to go up and then this is
the<00:02:13.629> tricky<00:02:14.020> part<00:02:14.050> make<00:02:14.800> sure<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:15.069> go<00:02:15.280> down<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the tricky part make sure to go down and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.690 
the tricky part make sure to go down and
to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.650> don't<00:02:18.129> go<00:02:18.459> up

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
to the right so that you don't go up

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.339 
to the right so that you don't go up
here<00:02:19.090> I've<00:02:19.450> actually<00:02:19.629> done<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.930> quite<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.260> few

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
here I've actually done that quite a few

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.320 
here I've actually done that quite a few
times<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.129> stuck<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.640> then<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.150> do

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
times and you get stuck and then you do

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.780 
times and you get stuck and then you do
redo<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.319> disconnect<00:02:23.769> glitch<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.670> is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
redo the disconnect glitch and that is

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.690 
redo the disconnect glitch and that is
just<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.120> pain<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.050> ass<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:27.190> once<00:02:27.489> you're
