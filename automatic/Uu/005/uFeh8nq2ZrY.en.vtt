 hello all are today will be 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 livebox one to make you a little 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 tutor how well plugs how well 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 set to have the sound in the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.530
 headphones on a x 720 are an x ​​propus 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.760
 triton and an astro at 40 it works for 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.950
 each helmet 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 I saw a lot of topics 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.810
 get back to the point like and all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 how to do it and where it's very 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.449
 simple you go into settings in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.140
 the settings you go into a 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.879
 and without and after when you are 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.859
 arrived in a pie and his it takes 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.329
 to put one's own can be 0 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.800
 uncompressed you have to wait for a bet 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.120
 up to date for putting in 7.1 and everything is 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.920
 the same for optics, we have to wait 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 update but there you put in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 uncompressed stereo for now 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 correctly plug in your headphones 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.900
 optically and or if you do not see the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.329
 little optical light to him but that's 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.689
 normal because you do not receive 5 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.290
 points 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.270
 that's totally why it's about 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.009
 newts if you see the no less we have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 a little light to say that it's 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.100
 well connected in optics we receive well 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 in optics in seven points 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 because I have only one point in five 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.840
 points you do not you can not see 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.570
 the light comes on and but you have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.750
 still the sound whose ears because 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.210
 it's not in it's not in five points 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 that's normal 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 in any case I hope you have 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.759
 understood this type all isolated from 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.870
 questions do not forget to leave some 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.120
 comments and everything 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.080
 and that's what and we say low for a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.330
 next video on call of duty ghost 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.420
 exoteric this rate to the next league
