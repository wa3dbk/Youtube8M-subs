00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello to all the boys and girls 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.050
 welcome to splash magazine games a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.020
 day more very good morning let's start 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.270
 with a news that jumped in the afternoon 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.239
 Yesterday 's controversy yesterday 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.779
 we talk about rain man legends one of the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.600
 games but the most anticipated of willow 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 suffers a new delay no longer only 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 is that we do not enjoy it with the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 launch of the console but 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 we should have enjoyed this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.059
 same month we were all looking forward 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.190
 play it and it seems that it will not be like that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.859
 hold on very tight because it seems to be 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.870
 that the new king launch date 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.999
 man legends puts it in the month of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.249
 September of this same year we are 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.890
 talking about many months of launch 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.719
 let's clear up all the doubts surrounding 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.429
 to this delay and is that during 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.680
 last several hours have skipped several 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.570
 news about this king man legends 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 but until the last moment has not been 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 confirmed everything and eye to the data because 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 Playstation3 and Xbox 360 are also going to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 receive this title that supposedly 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 it was temporarily 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 exclusive for wii from ubisoft have 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.900
 saying 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.300
 we hear that many xbox owners 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
 and playstation and rayman fans wanted 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.920
 play it so we have decided to give the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 fans what they wanted at the same time 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.660
 we expand the audience of this innovator 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.790
 and memorable game you can imagine what 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.790
 bad that has seated the fans 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.400
 of nintendo about all this delay in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.470
 willie and even more so the reason why 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 delays the title because a lot of attention 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.580
 to the words that ubisoft has given 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.350
 during the last hours there is no 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.720
 problems with the development of the game 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.030
 all the information is what was given to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.550
 the press the only reason to delay 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.830
 the game is to launch it in multiple 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 platforms these will be the words of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.780
 the very sarah irving representative 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 of ubisoft we usually throw in all 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 platforms simultaneously except in 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 pc we have made special exceptions in 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 the past but it's only in cases 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.970
 concrete and not our strategy 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.130
 standard in this case ubisoft has 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.350
 recently decided to launch the game 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.330
 on multiple platforms so the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.050
 Delay decision has been taken to 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.780
 throw 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.120
 at the same time and not separately and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.640
 A lot of attention with what he says at the end 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.830
 of this speech and it stays so wide 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.950
 says I know it's not an answer 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.290
 elaborate or convincing but it's the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.860
 simple, so, well, well, there 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.370
 is that that king man legends delayed 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.670
 the most anticipated game of the past 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.790
 days 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.250
 for willy and the truth is that the console 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 of nintendo does not raise head with this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.260
 king man legends was a small light to the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.020
 end of the tunnel at the time of doing 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.000
 sales in wii and it seems that neither 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.370
 is going to be able to be good because they have 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.650
 decided to delay it and good guys what 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.780
 you think of this delay of king 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.000
 man legends do you think it really is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.040
 just and certainly how will adapt the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.680
 playability of this title that does not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.770
 let's forget it's made for the wild 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.270
 gamepad specifically as you think that 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.820
 is going to adapt to the other consoles 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.520
 because thus playstation3 can play 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.180
 gowns with ps vita but how will the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.380
 players of the xbox 360 for example without 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.630
 place to doubt 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.090
 the news that closed the day of 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.010
 yesterday and with which we wake up today there will be 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.530
 to wait until next month 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.790
 September to enjoy this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.790
 great game that looks great
