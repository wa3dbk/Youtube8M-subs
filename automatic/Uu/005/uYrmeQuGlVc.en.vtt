the very Crusaders I had so recently
revered<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:46.610> irony<00:06:47.240> pierced<00:06:47.720> me<00:06:47.930> and<00:06:48.470> with

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
revered the irony pierced me and with

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.150 
revered the irony pierced me and with
dawning<00:06:49.700> horror<00:06:50.090> I<00:06:50.560> realized<00:06:51.560> that<00:06:51.830> I<00:06:51.980> had

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
dawning horror I realized that I had

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.130 
dawning horror I realized that I had
been<00:06:52.280> duped<00:06:52.640> by<00:06:52.910> mobius<00:06:53.480> from<00:06:53.690> the<00:06:53.810> beginning

for the Saarland had simply followed the
path<00:06:57.170> like<00:06:57.500> gonna<00:06:57.800> be<00:06:58.010> blazed<00:06:58.340> through<00:06:58.640> the

Moebius<00:07:01.670> of<00:07:01.850> staff<00:07:02.320> thus<00:07:03.320> armed<00:07:03.830> they<00:07:04.460> had

Janos at their mercy through the door I

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.760 
Janos at their mercy through the door I
could<00:07:08.030> hear<00:07:08.390> them<00:07:08.540> battling<00:07:08.990> less<00:07:09.440> than<00:07:09.680> a

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770

by elemental forces I did not possess it

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.000 
by elemental forces I did not possess it
seemed<00:07:20.420> Janos<00:07:20.840> had<00:07:21.050> conveyed<00:07:21.440> me<00:07:21.710> into<00:07:21.920> the

heart of the fire shrine

heart of the fire shrine
I<00:07:23.750> thought<00:07:24.740> perhaps<00:07:24.920> if<00:07:25.640> I<00:07:25.790> could<00:07:25.850> galvanize

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
I thought perhaps if I could galvanize

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.230 
I thought perhaps if I could galvanize

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
the Forge and imbue the Reaver in time I

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.780 
the Forge and imbue the Reaver in time I
might<00:07:29.690> have<00:07:29.960> a<00:07:29.990> slim<00:07:30.350> chance<00:07:30.380> of<00:07:30.980> saving<00:07:31.250> Janos

might have a slim chance of saving Janos
