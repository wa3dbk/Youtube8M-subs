out of hockey I mean these guys were
pretty<00:00:38.160> earnest<00:00:38.610> guys<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> begin<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pretty earnest guys to begin with I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
pretty earnest guys to begin with I
think<00:00:40.710> more<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:40.950> anything<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> talked<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
think more than anything and I talked to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549

Matthew<00:00:42.120> before<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.840> went<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
Matthew before we went on about it a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.100 
Matthew before we went on about it a
little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.730> dumb

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
little bit I think was just a dumb

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.880 
little bit I think was just a dumb
celebration<00:00:46.110> more<00:00:46.260> than<00:00:46.350> anything<00:00:46.500> else<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
celebration more than anything else it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
celebration more than anything else it
was<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.160> didn't<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.460> any<00:00:47.670> any<00:00:47.879> zip<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
was just didn't have any any zip to it I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
was just didn't have any any zip to it I
mean<00:00:48.750> everybody<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> wondering

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
mean everybody was kind of wondering

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
mean everybody was kind of wondering
what<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.460> doing<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> puck<00:00:51.870> wouldn't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
what was he doing when the puck wouldn't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
what was he doing when the puck wouldn't
always<00:00:52.379> stick<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> ice<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
always stick on the ice but to me I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
always stick on the ice but to me I
think<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.840> much<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.500> nothing<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
think it's much to do about nothing and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
think it's much to do about nothing and
I<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.170> guys<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> little

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
I like I like it when guys have a little

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
I like I like it when guys have a little
emotion<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.730> won't<00:00:59.910> even<00:01:00.059> make

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
emotion and if they won't even make

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
emotion and if they won't even make
