00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.650
Gaming laptops do not exist today.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.230
There are desktop replacements that perform well for gaming

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.951
but are over 3 inches thick

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.601
and weight up to 10 pounds.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.750
Nothing that would be called truly portable.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.710
And on the other hand there are really thin portables,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.231
but they lack the perfomance required for gaming,

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:23.771
but are great for surfing and office applications.

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.201
We decided to develop a system from ground up,

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.351
something truely phenomenal.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.620
Something designed both for perfomance and portability.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.360
Something we believe to be the world's first gaming laptop.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.660
Thinner than an inch

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.680
and weight less than 7 pounds

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
The Razer Blade is the thinnest laptop of it's class.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.630
Gaming is very important category for Intel

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.220
so we continue to innovate around form factor, usages 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.021
and capabilities to benefit the end users.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.371
With on of the latest

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:24.421
and most powerful Core i7 processor from Intel

00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.691
gamers will now be able to immerse themselves 

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.771
in an interactive experience,

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.650
with a balanced system, designed to achieve stunning framerates

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.135
with all the latest and most intense PC games today.

00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.271
Incredible perfomance in extremely thin form factor

00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:47.671
that's innovation, that gamers can truly appreciate with Razer and Intel.

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.621
Nvidia is proud to be part of what Razer accomplished with the Razer Blade.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.671
Best in class gaming perfomance 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
without compromising on it's ultra-portable form factor

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Equipped with a high perfomance GeForce GPU

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.800
along with battery saving Optimus technology

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
the Razer Blade screen is both power and portability 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.000
With this kind of graphics perfomance 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.000
the Razer Blade will provide the exceptional experience that gamers demand

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.450
All in an ultra-portable notebook.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.000
The Razer Blade's dynamic adaptive key technology

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.100
puts all your commands, controls and skills right at your fingertips. 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.000
And we've combined that with a revolutionary LCD display

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.150
that is capable of two modes:

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.150
one mode that displays in-game information when you use your mouse

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.150
and another mode that functions

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.500
as an ultra-sensitive multi-touch panel designed just for gamers on the go.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.300
Sleek lightweight design.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.900
A powerful internal computing architecture.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.200
And the most innovative user interface available today.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.200
The Razer Blade will reinvent the way you look at PC gaming.
