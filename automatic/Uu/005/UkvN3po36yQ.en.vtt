00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
is an annoyance with Thunderbird because
when<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> minimize<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.310> can't

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
when you go to minimize it I can't

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.380 
when you go to minimize it I can't
actually<00:00:29.699> show<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.179> when<00:00:30.359> I

actually show you because when I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.939 
actually show you because when I
minimizing<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.019> goes<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.410> system<00:00:31.830> tray

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
minimizing it goes to the system tray

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.560 
minimizing it goes to the system tray
but<00:00:32.219> normally<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> minimize<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
but normally when you minimize it it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
but normally when you minimize it it
will<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.170> box<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> will

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
will have a box down here and it will

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.170 
will have a box down here and it will
stay<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.420> forever<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.790> constantly

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
minimize to tray turned off so I could

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.690 
minimize to tray turned off so I could
actually<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.410> minimize<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
actually just minimize it to like it is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
actually just minimize it to like it is
there<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.930> close<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.620> will<00:02:19.769> go

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
there but when I close it it will go

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.509 
there but when I close it it will go
into<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.940> taskbar<00:02:21.660> my<00:02:22.410> system<00:02:22.800> Traven<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.310> if<00:02:23.400> I

while<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:48.780> certain<00:02:49.019> minimal<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:50.060> that's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
while it's certain minimal but that's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
while it's certain minimal but that's
about<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.319> minimize<00:02:52.680> to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
about it really it's the minimize to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.640 
about it really it's the minimize to
tray<00:02:52.950> add-on<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.019> works<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.500> both

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
tray add-on and it works in both

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.860 
tray add-on and it works in both
thunderbird<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.430> firefox<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.750> use

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
thunderbird and firefox so if you use

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.449 
thunderbird and firefox so if you use
fun<00:02:58.079> bird<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.470> Firefox<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> may<00:02:59.400> be

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
fun bird or Firefox then it may be

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.250 
fun bird or Firefox then it may be
useful<00:02:59.670> for<00:02:59.879> you<00:03:00.120> I'll<00:03:00.540> provide<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> link<00:03:01.110> in
