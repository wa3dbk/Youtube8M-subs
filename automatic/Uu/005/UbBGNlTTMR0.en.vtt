00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
is actually a lighter color so it's not

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.610

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
showing up very well um and then on the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.500 
showing up very well um and then on the
other<00:01:19.890> end<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:21.680> fine<00:01:22.680> tip<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> get

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
other end is a fine tip so you can get

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.660 
other end is a fine tip so you can get
some<00:01:24.660> detail<00:01:25.020> work<00:01:25.260> um<00:01:25.620> it's<00:01:26.400> about<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
some detail work um it's about a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.170 
some detail work um it's about a
millimeter<00:01:27.630> probably<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.100> width<00:01:29.370> so<00:01:29.910> it's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
millimeter probably and width so it's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.710 
millimeter probably and width so it's
not<00:01:30.270> too<00:01:30.630> too<00:01:30.930> fine<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.700> nice<00:01:33.420> enough<00:01:33.690> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
not too too fine but just nice enough to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.760 
not too too fine but just nice enough to
get<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> few<00:01:34.140> details<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:36.200> they<00:01:37.200> are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
get a few details um they are
water-based<00:01:38.760> markers<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:40.260> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.790> they

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
water-based markers so they kind of they

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
water-based markers so they kind of they
don't<00:01:41.940> bleed<00:01:42.300> but<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.900> kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.590> blend

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
don't bleed but they kind of like blend

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.270 
don't bleed but they kind of like blend
with<00:01:44.310> other<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.080> colors<00:01:46.620> very<00:01:46.860> well<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
with other you know colors very well and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.890 
with other you know colors very well and
they're<00:01:47.400> kind<00:01:47.760> of<00:01:47.850> transparent<00:01:48.480> so<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.690> kind

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
they're kind of transparent so they kind

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.020 
they're kind of transparent so they kind
of<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.010> fun<00:01:50.400> overlapping

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of have this really fun overlapping

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.130 
of have this really fun overlapping
effect<00:01:51.860> they<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.040> smell<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.960> Copic<00:01:54.960> or

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
effect they don't smell like Copic or

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
effect they don't smell like Copic or
prismacolor<00:01:55.530> markers<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.580> those<00:01:56.730> are

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
prismacolor markers do because those are

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.770 
prismacolor markers do because those are
alcohol-based<00:01:57.740> um<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.330> you<00:02:00.330> know<00:02:00.450> they're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
alcohol-based um and you know they're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.010 
alcohol-based um and you know they're
pretty<00:02:00.960> non-toxic<00:02:01.940> they're<00:02:02.940> also<00:02:03.300> acid<00:02:03.720> free

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
pretty non-toxic they're also acid free

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.649 
pretty non-toxic they're also acid free
so<00:02:04.260> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.650> worry<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.400> like<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.360> your

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so if you worry about like you know your

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749 
so if you worry about like you know your
paper<00:02:06.900> corroding<00:02:07.830> eventually<00:02:08.429> over<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
paper corroding eventually over the

paper<00:02:33.290> they're<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.470> waterproof<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.420> have

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
paper they're not waterproof so you have

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.970 
paper they're not waterproof so you have
to<00:02:36.750> make<00:02:36.930> sure<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.470> you're<00:02:37.620> using<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
things on top of it that's gonna you

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.199 
things on top of it that's gonna you
know<00:02:42.630> make<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.050> blend<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:44.040> badly

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
know make it blend very badly

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.400 
know make it blend very badly
um<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> mm-hmm

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
um so mm-hmm

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.970 
um so mm-hmm
sorry<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:53.910> video<00:02:54.180> cut<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.540> at<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.870> point<00:02:57.980> so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
sorry my video cut out at one point so

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.729 
sorry my video cut out at one point so
um<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.690> great<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:01.080> about<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.709> that

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
um the great thing about these is that

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.000 
um the great thing about these is that
they're<00:03:02.010> just<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.430> tip<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.660> big<00:03:04.560> um

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
they're just the tip is just so big um

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.420 
they're just the tip is just so big um
so<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.239> get<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:07.140> very<00:03:07.590> thin<00:03:08.040> lines

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
so you can get very very thin lines

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.570 
so you can get very very thin lines
probably<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> millimeter<00:03:09.510> um<00:03:10.500> maybe<00:03:11.430> a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
probably like a millimeter um maybe a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.400 
probably like a millimeter um maybe a
little<00:03:12.000> bit<00:03:12.150> smaller<00:03:12.480> um<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:14.760> know

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
little bit smaller um and then you know

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
little bit smaller um and then you know
gradually<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.620> thicker<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.130> how<00:03:17.280> you're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
gradually get thicker and how you're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.710 
gradually get thicker and how you're
using<00:03:17.640> totally<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.570> side<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.870> brush

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
using totally the side of the brush

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.780 
using totally the side of the brush
that's<00:03:21.720> what's<00:03:21.989> great<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:22.260> these<00:03:22.769> if<00:03:23.580> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
that's what's great about these if you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.100 
that's what's great about these if you
bite<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.540> go<00:03:24.799> see<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.950> take<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.310> ruler<00:03:26.519> here

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
bite a go see if I take my ruler here

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.000 
bite a go see if I take my ruler here
they<00:03:28.110> get<00:03:28.380> almost<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:30.019> probably<00:03:31.019> 3/8<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.890> an

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
they get almost up to probably 3/8 of an

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.199 
they get almost up to probably 3/8 of an
inch<00:03:32.150> thick<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:33.600> smaller<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.980> would<00:03:35.970> say

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
inch thick and then smaller I would say

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.660 
inch thick and then smaller I would say
that<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> millimeter<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:41.070> know<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.519> gives

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that a millimeter so you know that gives

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.110 
that a millimeter so you know that gives
you<00:03:41.820> such<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> wide<00:03:42.450> range<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.670> tip<00:03:45.000> is

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you such a wide range and the tip is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.030 
you such a wide range and the tip is
very<00:03:45.150> flexible<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:48.440> know<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.830> get

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
very flexible so you know you can get

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.610 
very flexible so you know you can get
thick's<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.940> Thins<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:54.140> pretty<00:03:56.120> easily<00:03:57.620> um

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
using is very smooth so they're pretty

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.849 
using is very smooth so they're pretty

smooth on this if you're going to use

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.219 
smooth on this if you're going to use
more<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.609> textured<00:04:21.120> paper<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.959> going<00:04:22.140> to

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
more of a textured paper it's going to

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.950 
more of a textured paper it's going to
be<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> little<00:04:22.680> bit<00:04:23.510> rougher<00:04:24.510> they're<00:04:24.780> going<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
be a little bit rougher they're going to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.520 
be a little bit rougher they're going to
sink<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.440> little<00:04:25.680> bit<00:04:25.830> more

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
sink in a little bit more

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.820 
sink in a little bit more
um<00:04:26.760> but<00:04:27.760> I've<00:04:28.240> had<00:04:28.510> some<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.410> these<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.740> have

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
um but I've had some of these that have

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.940 
um but I've had some of these that have
lasted<00:04:30.040> me<00:04:30.430> for<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:31.240> really<00:04:31.870> long<00:04:32.260> time<00:04:32.560> just

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
lasted me for a really long time just

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.629 
lasted me for a really long time just
using<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:34.350> non<00:04:35.350> absorbent<00:04:35.980> paper<00:04:36.130> so

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
using it on a non absorbent paper so

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.909 
using it on a non absorbent paper so
you're<00:04:37.240> going<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.419> get<00:04:37.570> quite<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:37.990> bit<00:04:38.290> of<00:04:38.440> ink

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
you're going to get quite a bit of ink

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.110 
you're going to get quite a bit of ink
out<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:40.230> um<00:04:41.280> yeah<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.700> think<00:04:42.940> that's

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
out of this um yeah and I think that's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.530 
out of this um yeah and I think that's
it

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
it

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.320 
it
so<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.650> leave<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.250> link<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.940> where<00:04:46.210> you

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330
