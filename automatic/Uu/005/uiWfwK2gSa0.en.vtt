allotment together so we kind of thought
maybe<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.809> good<00:00:39.960> idea

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
maybe that's a good idea

to<00:00:41.100> start<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:42.059> hard<00:00:42.300> work<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to start with it was really hard work it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
to start with it was really hard work it
was<00:00:42.899> intense<00:00:43.440> digging<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.489> actually<00:00:45.059> some

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
was intense digging which actually some

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
was intense digging which actually some
of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> kids<00:00:45.840> quite<00:00:46.230> enjoyed<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.890> allotment
