00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.320
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.759
 I'm going to show you a very good program 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.290
 which serves to freeze our 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.080
 computer 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.610
 and basically serves to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.309
 and recover deleted files 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.309
 accidentally to protect them from 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 only with resignation 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.949
 before, it also helps us to protect 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.989
 our computer restarts 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.420
 accidents that can damage our 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:44.300
 boot files the program will 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 call the freeze is the version 7.0 serious 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 I will leave all this in the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.490
 video description 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 well let's proceed then 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.860
 with the installation it is very simple 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 to whom the welcome of 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.440
 installation of the following 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.390
 here we accept the license terms 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.430
 We accept the following 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.409
 He even asks us to enter the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.549
 licence key 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 then enter it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.200
 the aircraft license key also in 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.420
 the winrar file 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 Here he asks us which partitions 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.280
 we want to protect what we want 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.229
 freeze 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.799
 and you listen if you want them 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.570
 freeze all in this case the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.280
 partition that is where are the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.470
 drivers programs 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.470
 Then the following 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 well here we are going to install it after 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.890
 this our computer is going to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.890
 restart 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 a few seconds here at this point already 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.120
 we do restart the computer myself 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 pause the video to make it very long 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.460
 then I will explain how 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.210
 works 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.470
 for if you want to store and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.690
 they want the information that should 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 save the computer from being 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.039
 thaw then to do this 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.910
 we're just going down here to 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.770
 established 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.380
 and the way to open the program is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.480
 holding the shift key and 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.330
 we double click 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.220
 at this point if they already put a 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.950
 password because they just put it and 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.200
 they give him ok me in this case I have not 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.500
 put no password then 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.540
 I simply give ok 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.990
 because they are the program options 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 at the top the computer will 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.630
 will restart frozen then if 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.940
 you want to keep files get 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 here in the third option and we give it 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.770
 down here where it says apply and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 restart after restart 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.940
 pretty frozen computer and they're going to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.200
 to be able to make the configurations 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.500
 changes that you want 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.080
 they will be able to save the files well 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.150
 I also want to explain to you that this 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.830
 program is very good if you for 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.650
 example are doing some work and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.600
 at that time they are introduced some 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.340
 virus and the computer is slow 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.480
 then they will simply power 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.700
 restart 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.549
 and after being rebooted, they 're going to 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.860
 have again fast and free of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.610
 video 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.320
 good also serves to avoid this 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.020
 way the computer is left because 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.420
 some virus that gets you knows some 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.770
 boot file that reaches them 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 save money 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.040
 then they just restart and she goes 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.740
 to go back to the point that you had it right 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.470
 then this way if you are going to avoid 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.100
 this way creating the computer 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.550
 we must also save a lot of money 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.790
 this program basically prolongs the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.610
 Lifespan of our operating system 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.439
 good friends I think I would use all the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.859
 links I leave in the description of 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.629
 video since was the link of the file and 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.430
 I leave the password link both 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.290
 they are totally free 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.719
 and then, well, I hope it serves you 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.099
 thank you very much for watching the video and 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.099
 until a new opportunity
