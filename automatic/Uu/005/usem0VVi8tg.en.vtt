as<00:00:23.130> they<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.400> there's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.390> rough

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
as they all are there's a lot of rough

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.300 
as they all are there's a lot of rough
tracks<00:00:25.290> with<00:00:26.300> 2<00:00:27.300> foot<00:00:27.660> 3<00:00:27.930> foot<00:00:28.230> holes<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
frilly or dips so it's going to be a bit

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520

of a bone shaker for us there's a lot of
this<00:00:34.710> yet<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> think<00:00:35.220> it's<00:00:35.489> gonna<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.090> think

it's gonna be quite initially we are

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
it's gonna be quite initially we are

going for minute intervals as normal to
start<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:41.910> they're<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.120> see

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
start with and then they're gonna see

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.900 
start with and then they're gonna see
how<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.540> progresses<00:00:43.610> for<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> overall

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
how it progresses for the overall

how it progresses for the overall
championship<00:00:45.710> can<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> win<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.510> who<00:00:48.510> knows

total<00:01:35.840> atif<00:01:36.159> universalism<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.790> fact

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
total atif universalism is in fact

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.450 
total atif universalism is in fact
that's<00:01:39.200> by<00:01:39.380> far<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> biggest<00:01:39.860> impact<00:01:40.310> we've

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's by far the biggest impact we've

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.070 
that's by far the biggest impact we've
had<00:01:40.630> obviously<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.840> earth<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.290> was<00:01:42.410> just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
had obviously not on earth it was just

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.120 
had obviously not on earth it was just
we've<00:01:45.080> hit<00:01:45.200> something<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.770> track<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
we've hit something in the track and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.040 
we've hit something in the track and
bellied<00:01:46.670> out<00:01:46.760> on<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.150> something<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> track

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
bellied out on to something in the track

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.170 
bellied out on to something in the track
well<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.830> think<00:01:48.950> there's<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.220> tiny<00:01:49.430> bit<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.700> mud

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
well we think there's a tiny bit of mud

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.749 
well we think there's a tiny bit of mud
that's<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.600> gone<00:01:50.750> into<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.759> atmospheric

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
that's just gone into the atmospheric

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.760 
that's just gone into the atmospheric
pressure<00:01:52.790> sensor<00:01:53.450> they<00:01:53.869> lost<00:01:54.110> power<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:54.650> it's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
pressure sensor they lost power but it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.030 
pressure sensor they lost power but it's
in<00:01:54.890> quantico<00:01:55.460> mode<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.509> we've<00:01:57.350> got<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.650> laptop

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
in quantico mode so we've got the laptop

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:35.300 
in quantico mode so we've got the laptop
on<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:59.570> go<00:01:59.950> down<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.979> car<00:02:01.310> again

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.890 

we<00:02:35.850> found<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.510> issue<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.800> having<00:02:37.830> but

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
we found the issue that we're having but

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.450 
we found the issue that we're having but
weren't<00:02:39.900> our<00:02:40.140> way<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.380> curing<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.860> but

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
weren't our way of curing it but

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.340 
weren't our way of curing it but
unfortunately<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:42.090> does<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.630> us<00:02:42.660> where

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
unfortunately it does this to us where

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.550 
unfortunately it does this to us where
we're<00:02:43.500> absolutely<00:02:44.030> cooking<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
we're absolutely cooking because the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.870 
we're absolutely cooking because the
ambient<00:02:46.830> temperature<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.550> high<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
ambient temperature is so high and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.880 
ambient temperature is so high and
there's<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.330> lot<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.510> steep<00:02:48.750> climbs<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
there's a lot of steep climbs the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.310 
there's a lot of steep climbs the
temperature<00:02:50.760> gauge<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.480> 3/4<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
temperature gauge going up to 3/4 and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.199 
temperature gauge going up to 3/4 and
the<00:02:52.440> engine<00:02:52.830> has<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> safety<00:02:53.310> system<00:02:53.610> built<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the engine has a safety system built in

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.960 
the engine has a safety system built in
but<00:02:54.750> that's<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> power<00:02:55.350> off<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.980> engine

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
but that's the power off when the engine

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:08.810 
but that's the power off when the engine
looks<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.600> overheat<00:03:07.820> yesterday

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
looks like it's gonna overheat yesterday

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.370 
looks like it's gonna overheat yesterday
some<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:09.239> well<00:03:09.390> empty<00:03:09.810> problems<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.320> start

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
some really well empty problems to start

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
some really well empty problems to start
with<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.250> verheek<00:03:11.489> English<00:03:11.820> group<00:03:11.970> we

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
with with a verheek English group we

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
with with a verheek English group we
finally<00:03:12.660> narrowed<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.050> down<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.230> overheating

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
finally narrowed it down to overheating

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.780 
finally narrowed it down to overheating
and<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.959> was<00:03:16.110> fixed<00:03:16.410> by<00:03:16.739> drilling<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and that was fixed by drilling with the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.320 
and that was fixed by drilling with the
heater<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.870> full<00:03:19.290> bore<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:20.430> meant<00:03:20.760> my<00:03:21.000> feet

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
heater on on full bore it meant my feet

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.820 
heater on on full bore it meant my feet
are<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.540> ready<00:03:21.900> chickens<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.680> had<00:03:22.770> a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
are like ready chickens then we had a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.979 
are like ready chickens then we had a
puncher<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.459> even<00:03:24.300> with<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.510> puncher<00:03:24.900> we

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
puncher and even with the puncher we

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.770 
puncher and even with the puncher we
still<00:03:25.200> did<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> 10<00:03:26.190> minutes<00:03:26.489> dead<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.660> our

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
still did a 10 minutes dead and our
