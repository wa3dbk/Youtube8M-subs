00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.210
 Welcome to our winter drive here from the driving camp 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.550
 from 4 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.190
 the world is talking about winter tires from the first of November 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.139
 PrÃ¶ll pieces may also mature with winter tires 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.390
 less worries about why it might be better 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.240
 to be on the road in wintry conditions with the right tire 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.919
 Watch the hormone second yen at the Kempa by doing so 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.990
 two different choirs sides vehicles on our sliding surfaces 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.699
 the demolish winter driving conditions will slow down 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.170
 and we become very clear 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.260
 show the difference 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.220
 hopefully they will understand why not only is duty but 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.670
 also absolutely sensible in time before the winter comes 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.770
 to mount the winter tire on the vehicle 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.680
 our tip is even 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.670
 Furyk 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.560
 if possible then the temperatures regularly below seven degrees plus themselves 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.810
 to convert on the winter tires and not wait until the 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.810
 first snow fell 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.220
 on the first ride 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.790
 At the selected a vehicle with winter tires and make a full stop 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.190
 50 gave h 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.320
 Xinlifeng 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 to pass the vehicle unchecked but he is already out of others 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.810
 Tips we have shown here ensures that the vehicle lane is stable 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.470
 remains 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.660
 and the braking distance is manageable Kurth 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.450
 at the point where the car came to a halt 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910
 we mark 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.470
 the and the Xion with pylons 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 and do a second ride with a comparison case stuff with summer tires 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.159
 the summer tires are absolutely fine are not in the manipulated but 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.410
 about half a year old 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.250
 because he stays in this now on the slippery surface who would have thought it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 significantly worse that is the braking distance is extended 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 Wai's summer tires in wintry temperatures 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 Gutzwiller driving club 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.790
 the handles rear-end collision 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.629
 this fitted tire works 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.470
 with only one of the reasons 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.289
 who speak for the winter tire 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.969
 you see the vehicle breaks through the pylons row that is the braking distance 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.149
 is longer but of course the controller over the vehicle the 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.319
 Driving time stability suffers in wintry conditions 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.839
 at the vehicle with summer tires 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:34.529
 which is why our appeal to them change in due time from October to Easter what 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.119
 easy to remember or as soon as temperatures drop below seven degrees 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.039
 the winter tires should have been mounted on the vehicle
