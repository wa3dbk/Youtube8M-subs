00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello everyone, William and today I 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.550
 I would like to tell you how to open 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.139
 ports for minecraft on windows 7 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.850
 I looked a lot of sites looked very 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.859
 many videos and found no way 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.550
 which one would come up for well in general for me 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 I tried to open 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 did anything but not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.300
 I tried to get through the firewall 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.270
 and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.149
 nothing worked through the router and you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 Now ask, but how can I not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 I know how to open ports, yes, very 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 just again we need a firewall in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 generally go to the firewall and the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.079
 The main thing I noticed is that people who 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.260
 explained how to open they created 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.750
 new rules that is 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.530
 created a rule mikroft all that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.850
 but the joke is that if you lower a little 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.320
 Here below there are usually like that java 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 have you see me here somehow 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:25.049
 just fine i won't count 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 in general, 2 in total, four such as 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.759
 would be forbidden java and here in the middle 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.009
 between them as if resolved 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.479
 Actually when I first started right here 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.290
 Is it worth it? 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 what is the sheet look and see once 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 that these are all kind of banned and I 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.500
 I thought maybe this is their reason 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.570
 Well, in general, I tried to do it like this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.100
 here that is, I pressed not their properties and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.250
 continue to allow the connection click ok 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.410
 allowed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.800
 so here yes 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.140
 It certainly sounds strange but I even 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.410
 I did not create any rules. 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.930
 so here we do permission to connect 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.840
 I have these four specially for you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.700
 did as I had before because 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.940
 it's all back but so reluctant to you 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 do it all but the bottom line is 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 just allow connection here to 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.430
 these rules jawad to all sting and all 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.260
 further generally close so here 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.630
 we start minecraft 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.280
 but I 'll also explain how to play by 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.730
 networks there are of course two ways you can 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.130
 through and through and ranks through single 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.800
 you can play the game and you can 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.250
 create a server but create a server 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:05.410
 more problematic especially if you if you 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.810
 what if you're going to play with mods 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.290
 That may not all go fashion on the server 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.650
 so it is very convenient and so we created 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.390
 new world we don't have flap podlagivaet well 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.680
 Well now I explain how you play 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.590
 more precisely yes 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.220
 play on the net now people would think 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.620
 are you a noob how do we know how to play 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.709
 Generally, you still need to download 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.380
 such program or the like but hamachi 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.540
 someone says hamachi someone hamachi 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.030
 Well, you download this program 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 install further well press 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.650
 turn on I think everyone understands it and I 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.640
 already of course several networks they 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.390
 I really need 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.020
 and I will not delete them but still you 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.770
 explain a little wait until it's all 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.480
 will boot 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.480
 and now we press the network and further 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.700
 depends what you need if you want 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.510
 so that you play but you already estesno 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.230
 ports open 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.120
 then you click create a new network 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.640
 enter some kind of indifiers and i 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.200
 eg 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.730
 I push on any nonsense further 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.070
 enter the password here and here and create 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.660
 here's how you see here appeared here 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.770
 this here is the network that we just 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.790
 created and now connects to it as 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.940
 to not connect 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.690
 it's very easy now to remove this network 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.300
 because I don't need it anymore 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.750
 if you need to connect or your 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.930
 friend to you in general push 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.919
 connect to the existing network he 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.590
 must enter that identifier which you 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.110
 wrote when creating a network the same 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:07.570
 a password that I think you understand created 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.940
 when creating a network like that in general i am not 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.979
 I will write it because it is me 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.750
 no need in general, I think you understand so I 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.470
 for now I'll shut it all down 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:24.850
 and then I show you what 's next for us 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.890
 need what to do press escape i don't 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.890
 I know how you do but I do so to
