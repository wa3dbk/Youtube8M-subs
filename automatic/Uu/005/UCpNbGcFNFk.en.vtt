00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.820
 asshole according to the ema

 we will put are the guys it's all 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.840
 cons as they think that to fuck ah 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.530
 no but frankly they take us 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.210
 for objects what hi friends 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.710
 it's true that it's 25 coach and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090
 founder of the site briefing.com 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.340
 today in this video 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.770
 I want to talk to you about this 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.350
 belief that you surely already have 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.559
 heard in someone's mouth or 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.170
 maybe you already have surely 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:59.030
 maybe you said yourself 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.470
 it is this belief that is that 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.150
 girls where the guys are all 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:09.220
 assholes who know that we have 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.380
 none or none that's worth it and that 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.310
 it's useless to lower the numbers 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.740
 arm and it's good friends friends 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.600
 it is fortunately not serious 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 all that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 so know that from less than 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.220
 you say that will surely you you 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 repeat that people are all 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.950
 cons are all bad guys are affected they 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.330
 are all there for interest they are 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.000
 all there to harm you 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.070
 and that's from the least you think 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 that kind of apartment thing that you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 think anything else 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.790
 gradually that you repeat a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.970
 affirmation of this type there you create the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.670
 neurological signals the signals 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.690
 biochemicals in your brain that are going 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.990
 you condition 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.360
 to see only the assholes of the connasses 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.410
 bad guys people there by 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.860
 interest and that's the reality she's 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.020
 any other 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 the reality is that there are good people 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.490
 everywhere the reality is that there is 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.080
 actually i will be honest with 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.070
 you there are cons 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.070
 in this world there are launch codes 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.870
 but is a lot more good people and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.540
 many more intelligent people there are 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 many more people well all 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.980
 simply 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.690
 but in fact simply from the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 moment when you always repeat the same 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.840
 thing you 're going to always pull the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 same thing 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.460
 this is to discuss in fact 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.910
 it's simple we do not even need to 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.070
 discuss 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.700
 I give you an example for example 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.670
 you think you buy a car or 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.170
 a cell phone that everyone 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.760
 you want to buy the last phone 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.390
 portable you have the brand the model 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.830
 precisely and oddly from the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.110
 moment that you have in mind not you 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.670
 go see everywhere from me 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.730
 want to buy it or you already have it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.620
 bought you will see everywhere a 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.459
 new car wanted to buy a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.470
 car such car 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.330
 you had not seen it before but from the moment 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.070
 where you were focusing on this 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.900
 new car you see everywhere 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.530
 simply because your brain 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.380
 is programmed is focused on this 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 thing here you do not have any creamer did 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.739
 not had more because as by chance 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.110
 no it's just because you 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.959
 are focused on this thing and the fact 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.500
 to say that there are only idiots 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.170
 cons all knowledgeable even if at the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 base you meet someone who is not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.230
 not con not bitch bath 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.400
 already either you 're not going to have it 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.190
 simply this person who is not 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.950
 stupid or that we are simply 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.260
 even if you see it you have 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.970
 an interaction with that person you 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.860
 go see your brain is not going to be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.270
 focused only on things that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.180
 justify the fact that this person 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.020
 is stupid it means thank you to the 99 % 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.410
 of things good of things well you are going 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.959
 you focus only on the 1% that out 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.430
 the 1 % that will justify you spend 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.270
 your affirmations that you are repeated 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.250
 all along 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.390
 from home not helped I know people 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.620
 it's been years and years 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.239
 repeating the same thing and then good bah 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.920
 actually they have all the arguments 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.930
 to prove what they say lensois this 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.300
 is just a perception of reality and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.730
 if you do not know your reality you 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.320
 created it by your brain the reality 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.760
 is just an interview is just 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.750
 interpretation of electrical signals 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.740
 in our brains that are sent by 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 our eyes our ears 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.850
 our feelings ours ours all our 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.820
 olfactory and gustatory system of active 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.890
 and taste good friends 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.190
 so from the moment you start to 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.900
 to have that idiots that know me 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.790
 I think we have to go back 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.720
 question just by the fact that at the end 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.940
 of a moment when everyone is 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 glad to ask you the question if it's 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.640
 not themselves that they are cons and that 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.980
 you for a moment when we see that as soon 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.510
 to be taught me think that it is necessary 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.950
 question the camera well and 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.780
 understand that actually even if you 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.550
 do not say consciously if you see that 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.210
 cons or connes besides a bunch of 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.770
 negative things 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.780
 it's just at the bottom of you 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.940
 even in your unconscious you are in 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.620
 repeating these kinds of things which 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.400
 you simply have to change 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.010
 this affirmation 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.200
 in ten years people are all good at 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.410
 people are all nice people years 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.990
 are all here for good and you're going 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.310
 see that inevitably you are going 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.450
 change your relationships are you going to 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.730
 change the perception of the world of your 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.060
 surrounding etc and you will see that they 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.070
 were inevitably going to create life that 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.350
 you want and move towards success
