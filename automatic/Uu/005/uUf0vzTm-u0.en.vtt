continuously over and over and over just
doing<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> same<00:00:33.090> strategy<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
doing the same strategy and this is

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
doing the same strategy and this is
pretty<00:00:34.500> much<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> going

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
pretty much what you do so this is going

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.020 
pretty much what you do so this is going
to<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> Terran<00:00:37.770> strategy<00:00:38.280> i'm<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> be

to be a Terran strategy i'm going to be

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.709 
to be a Terran strategy i'm going to be
reversing<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> Protoss<00:00:40.050> player<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
reversing a Protoss player so what you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.650 
reversing a Protoss player so what you
want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:44.030> your<00:00:45.030> SUVs<00:00:45.570> like

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
normal and that nine supply you want to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
normal and that nine supply you want to
set<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.480> rally<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> bottom

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
set your rally point down to the bottom

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
set your rally point down to the bottom
of<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.100> ramp<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> already<00:00:50.969> gotten

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of your ramp so I have already gotten

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.869 
of your ramp so I have already gotten
not<00:00:51.600> done<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.770> 10<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
not done at 10 you want to put that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.470 
not done at 10 you want to put that
rally<00:00:54.210> point<00:00:54.480> back<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:56.280> building<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> supply

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
rally point back it's building a supply

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.700 
rally point back it's building a supply
depot<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.609> gonna<00:00:59.789> vary<00:00:59.879> per

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
depot right here now it's gonna vary per

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
depot right here now it's gonna vary per
map<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.149> could<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> on

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
map I don't think you could do this on

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.160 
map I don't think you could do this on
Delma<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:05.549> altar<00:01:06.090> whatever<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.930> also

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
Delma or the altar whatever not also

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.090 
Delma or the altar whatever not also
it's<00:01:07.470> called<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.670> big<00:01:08.850> map

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's called the really really big map

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's called the really really big map
anyway<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> larger<00:01:12.960> choke<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
anyway that has the larger choke so you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
anyway that has the larger choke so you
want<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> build<00:01:14.760> your<00:01:15.000> supply<00:01:15.299> depot

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
want to just build your supply depot

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.679 
want to just build your supply depot
there<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.830> much<00:01:16.950> once<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> hit<00:01:17.790> 11<00:01:18.570> or

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
there and pretty much once you hit 11 or

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.030 
there and pretty much once you hit 11 or
12<00:01:18.930> supply<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.340> building<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
12 supply you want to be building that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
12 supply you want to be building that
barracks<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.400> next<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.900> does

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
barracks right next to it so this does

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
barracks right next to it so this does
wall<00:01:25.380> off<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> bottom<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> your<00:01:26.189> ramp<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> may

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
wall off the bottom of your ramp it may

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.690 
wall off the bottom of your ramp it may
not<00:01:27.030> look<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.229> does<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.770> mean<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
not look like it but it does I mean and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.550 
not look like it but it does I mean and
that's<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> main<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> main

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that's the main thing that's the main

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
that's the main thing that's the main
part<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> strategy<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.460> falling<00:01:32.970> off<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
part of the strategy is falling off the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
part of the strategy is falling off the
bottom<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.960> opponent<00:01:34.380> cannot<00:01:34.500> scout

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
bottom so your opponent cannot scout

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
bottom so your opponent cannot scout
into<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> meat<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.479> base<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> you'll

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
into the meat of your base and you'll

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.840 
into the meat of your base and you'll
see<00:01:37.380> why<00:01:37.650> right<00:01:38.070> now

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
see why right now

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.160 
see why right now
I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.390> building<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:40.020> more

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I'm going to be building two more

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
I'm going to be building two more

SCV right here and I wanted to and I was
a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.369> paranoid<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
a little paranoid because this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600 
a little paranoid because this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
definitely did not look Walden so I just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
definitely did not look Walden so I just
wanted<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> make<00:01:51.270> sure<00:01:51.330> about<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.170> sent

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that TV at the bottom right there just

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
that TV at the bottom right there just
to<00:01:54.840> check<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.770> sure<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> part<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.640> the

later now I did send my marine right
here<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.060> make<00:02:34.209> sure<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.540> was<00:02:34.690> walled<00:02:34.930> off

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
here to make sure that was walled off

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.250 
here to make sure that was walled off
and<00:02:35.379> if<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.120> take<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:38.050> this

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and if we can just take a look at this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.180 
and if we can just take a look at this
SCV<00:02:38.950> real<00:02:39.670> quick<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:41.590> wanted<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.980> show<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
SCV real quick I just wanted to show you

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.210 
SCV real quick I just wanted to show you
guys<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:43.150> saw<00:02:43.870> his<00:02:44.140> scouting<00:02:44.530> probe<00:02:44.950> right

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
guys that I saw his scouting probe right

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.870 
guys that I saw his scouting probe right
here<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.849> figured<00:02:46.180> most<00:02:47.610> Protoss<00:02:48.610> players

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
here and I figured most Protoss players

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.330 
here and I figured most Protoss players
send<00:02:49.269> their<00:02:49.510> scouting<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:50.349> how's<00:02:50.650> fairly

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
send their scouting so how's fairly

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.460 
send their scouting so how's fairly
early<00:02:51.519> like<00:02:51.940> right<00:02:52.209> after<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.660> build<00:02:52.930> their

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
early like right after they build their

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.699 
early like right after they build their
first<00:02:54.310> pylon<00:02:54.790> or<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.269> gateway<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.380> think

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
first pylon or this gateway so I think

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.520 
first pylon or this gateway so I think
with<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.940> probe<00:02:57.940> was<00:02:58.329> probably<00:02:58.930> not<00:02:59.230> coming

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
with that probe was probably not coming

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.190 
with that probe was probably not coming
either<00:03:00.459> from<00:03:01.329> here<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.980> from<00:03:03.840> well<00:03:04.840> that's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
either from here or from well that's

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.820 
either from here or from well that's
pretty<00:03:05.410> much<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.980> only<00:03:06.160> other<00:03:06.459> place

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
pretty much the only other place

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.920 
pretty much the only other place
it<00:03:08.190> was<00:03:08.340> either<00:03:08.520> coming<00:03:08.790> from<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.630> here

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it was either coming from here or here

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.700 
it was either coming from here or here
so<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.650> did<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.640> into<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
so I did see it going into there and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.930 
so I did see it going into there and
since<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.770> CLE<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:14.100> wasn't<00:03:14.400> anybody<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.910> I

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
since I CLE there wasn't anybody that I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.020 
since I CLE there wasn't anybody that I
wanted<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> try<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.050> kill<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.850> against<00:03:17.850> we

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
wanted to try and kill that against we

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.780 
wanted to try and kill that against we
can<00:03:18.270> see<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.660> supply<00:03:19.020> depot<00:03:19.490> extra<00:03:20.490> supply

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
can see my supply depot extra supply

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.440 
can see my supply depot extra supply
drop<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.510> unfortunately<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.620> is

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.520 

I<00:03:25.510> don't<00:03:26.230> even<00:03:26.319> know<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:27.150> side<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.270> base

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
I don't even know what side the base

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.750 
I don't even know what side the base
maybe<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.650> was<00:03:29.739> just<00:03:29.769> trying<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.250> confirm<00:03:30.580> that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
maybe it was just trying to confirm that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.460 
maybe it was just trying to confirm that
I<00:03:30.790> wasn't<00:03:30.970> expanding<00:03:31.629> too<00:03:31.780> early<00:03:32.080> but

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
I wasn't expanding too early but

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.000 
I wasn't expanding too early but
regardless<00:03:32.890> he<00:03:33.370> did<00:03:33.550> get<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:35.970> saw<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.209> kiosk

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
regardless he did get I saw that kiosk

right<00:04:01.180> here<00:04:01.420> as<00:04:01.569> well<00:04:01.930> as<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.110> bunch<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.799> at<00:04:02.950> CVS

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
right here as well as a bunch of at CVS

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.660 
right here as well as a bunch of at CVS
so<00:04:04.690> here<00:04:05.380> we<00:04:05.500> go<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:05.799> want<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.250> group<00:04:06.489> up

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
so here we go I just want to group up

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.400 
so here we go I just want to group up
all<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.030> SUV's<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.720> Marines<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.140> same

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
all the SUV's and Marines in the same

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.009 
all the SUV's and Marines in the same
position<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:08.920> want<00:04:09.190> my<00:04:09.459> s<00:04:09.819> CBS<00:04:10.060> 2<00:04:10.450> tank<00:04:10.690> as<00:04:10.840> much

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
position I want my s CBS 2 tank as much

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.140 
position I want my s CBS 2 tank as much
damage<00:04:11.290> leaving

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:38.270 

bicep<00:04:17.150> my<00:04:17.560> first

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.439 

so<00:04:39.280> that's<00:04:39.490> pretty<00:04:39.670> much<00:04:39.820> all<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.210> to

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
so that's pretty much all you have to

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.540 
so that's pretty much all you have to
make<00:04:42.199> sure<00:04:42.229> you<00:04:42.499> wall<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.979> bottom<00:04:43.279> of<00:04:43.430> this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
make sure you wall the bottom of this

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.249 
make sure you wall the bottom of this
ramp<00:04:43.789> off<00:04:43.999> so<00:04:44.180> your<00:04:44.330> opponent<00:04:44.779> doesn't<00:04:44.990> know

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
ramp off so your opponent doesn't know

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.189 
ramp off so your opponent doesn't know
you're<00:04:45.439> doing<00:04:45.590> anything<00:04:45.949> too<00:04:46.340> cheesy<00:04:46.699> and

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
you're doing anything too cheesy and

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.519 
you're doing anything too cheesy and
then<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:49.879> shove<00:04:50.509> all<00:04:50.689> of<00:04:50.870> your<00:04:51.050> s<00:04:51.259> CBS

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:51.529 
then you just shove all of your s CBS

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.499 
then you just shove all of your s CBS
and<00:04:51.979> all<00:04:52.069> of<00:04:52.219> your<00:04:52.370> Marines<00:04:52.669> down<00:04:52.909> his<00:04:53.089> throat

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
and all of your Marines down his throat

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.480 
and all of your Marines down his throat
and<00:04:53.569> then<00:04:54.020> hope<00:04:54.409> everything<00:04:55.189> goes<00:04:55.339> according

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
and then hope everything goes according

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.519 
and then hope everything goes according
to<00:04:55.759> plan<00:04:55.999> you<00:04:56.569> all<00:04:56.719> probably<00:04:57.110> also<00:04:57.379> have

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
to plan you all probably also have

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.709 
to plan you all probably also have
enough<00:04:57.919> energy<00:04:58.249> for<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.789> mule<00:04:59.089> I<00:04:59.360> mean<00:04:59.539> you

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
enough energy for a mule I mean you

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.390 
enough energy for a mule I mean you
could<00:04:59.900> do<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.229> strategy<00:05:00.680> even<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:01.069> little<00:05:01.279> bit

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
could do this strategy even a little bit

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.640 
could do this strategy even a little bit
earlier<00:05:01.520> I<00:05:01.819> don't<00:05:02.120> think<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.839> need<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.110> wait

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
earlier I don't think you need to wait

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.040 
earlier I don't think you need to wait
for<00:05:03.680> as<00:05:04.039> many<00:05:04.219> Marines<00:05:04.580> because<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.939> had<00:05:05.120> you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
for as many Marines because I had you

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.869 
for as many Marines because I had you
can<00:05:06.169> also<00:05:06.409> use<00:05:06.589> your<00:05:06.770> initial<00:05:07.490> couple<00:05:07.789> of

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
can also use your initial couple of

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.239 
can also use your initial couple of
Marines<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.990> clear<00:05:09.259> these<00:05:09.409> dell<00:05:09.710> Naga<00:05:09.889> cat

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:10.249 
Marines to clear these dell Naga cat

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.809 
Marines to clear these dell Naga cat
towers<00:05:10.999> so<00:05:11.529> he<00:05:12.529> won't<00:05:12.710> scout<00:05:13.159> anything<00:05:13.639> and

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
towers so he won't scout anything and

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.550 
towers so he won't scout anything and
have<00:05:13.969> a<00:05:14.029> chance<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.509> wall<00:05:14.749> anything<00:05:15.020> off<00:05:15.319> as

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
have a chance to wall anything off as

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.459 
have a chance to wall anything off as
well<00:05:15.800> or<00:05:16.099> build<00:05:16.699> additional<00:05:17.210> defenses<00:05:17.569> so

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
well or build additional defenses so

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.399 
well or build additional defenses so
that's<00:05:18.680> pretty<00:05:18.889> important<00:05:19.339> as<00:05:19.460> well<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.569> this

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
that's pretty important as well so this

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.439 
that's pretty important as well so this
is<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.650> strategy<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.219> got<00:05:22.490> somebody<00:05:22.789> else<00:05:23.180> in

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
is a strategy that got somebody else in

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.029 
is a strategy that got somebody else in
