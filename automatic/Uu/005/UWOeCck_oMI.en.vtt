if you fall at my steps this is how it
all<00:04:07.340> should<00:04:07.670> look<00:04:07.879> I<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.690> seems<00:04:08.930> messy

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
all should look I know it seems messy

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.990

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.190 

now<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.420> where<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.750> cheese<00:04:15.050> comes<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:17.200> so

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
now this is where the cheese comes in so

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.440 
now this is where the cheese comes in so
you<00:04:18.320> cut<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> cheese<00:04:18.919> in<00:04:19.100> half<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.729> after<00:04:20.209> you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
you cut the cheese in half and after you

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.450 
you cut the cheese in half and after you
cut<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.810> cheese<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.320> half<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.919> laid<00:04:22.220> on

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.180 
cut the cheese in half you laid on
diagonally<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.510> bread<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.889> looks

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
diagonally on the bread so it looks

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.400 
diagonally on the bread so it looks
exactly<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.540> follow<00:04:26.750> like<00:04:27.200> how<00:04:27.380> I

with these toothpicks we are going to

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.490 
with these toothpicks we are going to
fold<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:47.060> bread<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.660> seal<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.140> with<00:05:48.350> the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
fold the bread and seal it with the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.970 
fold the bread and seal it with the
toothpick<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.580> right<00:05:49.850> now<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.630> just<00:05:50.930> take<00:05:51.320> the

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
toothpick so right now you just take the

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.480 
toothpick so right now you just take the
corners<00:05:52.700> of<00:05:53.120> two<00:05:53.450> corners<00:05:54.020> from<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.650> cheese<00:05:55.280> I

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
corners of two corners from the cheese I

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.130 
corners of two corners from the cheese I
guess<00:05:55.790> diagonally<00:05:56.300> from<00:05:56.420> the<00:05:56.510> bread<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.930> don't

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
guess diagonally from the bread I don't

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.780 
guess diagonally from the bread I don't
know<00:05:57.230> if<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.440> making<00:05:57.680> sense<00:05:57.890> but<00:05:58.310> just<00:05:58.370> fold

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
know if that making sense but just fold

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.760 
know if that making sense but just fold
it<00:05:58.910> like<00:05:59.060> how<00:05:59.240> I'm<00:05:59.450> holding<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.020> here<00:06:00.260> like<00:06:00.590> a

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
it like how I'm holding it here like a

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.460 
it like how I'm holding it here like a
divalent<00:06:01.160> across<00:06:02.120> each<00:06:02.360> other<00:06:02.510> and<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:03.230> take

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
divalent across each other and you take

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.550 
divalent across each other and you take
your<00:06:03.920> toothpick<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.670> you<00:06:04.730> sear<00:06:05.570> it<00:06:05.720> by<00:06:05.960> poking

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
your toothpick and you sear it by poking

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.850 
your toothpick and you sear it by poking
to<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.670> hole<00:06:08.090> actually<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.840> sealing<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.710> like

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
to a hole actually and sealing it like

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.420 
to a hole actually and sealing it like
that<00:06:11.020> do<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.290> same<00:06:12.320> with<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.860> rest<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.280> it

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
that do the same with the rest and it

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.610 
that do the same with the rest and it
should<00:06:13.580> look<00:06:13.760> like<00:06:13.820> this<00:06:14.270> and<00:06:14.570> you<00:06:15.110> can<00:06:15.290> put<00:06:15.530> it

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
should look like this and you can put it

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.000 
should look like this and you can put it
on<00:06:15.800> your<00:06:16.630> tray<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.200> will<00:06:18.320> be<00:06:18.440> ready<00:06:18.650> to
