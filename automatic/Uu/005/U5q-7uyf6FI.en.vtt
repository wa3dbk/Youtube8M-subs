00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 welcome to your channel tutorials and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 contributions today I will teach you how to recover 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 your files are deleted from a hard drive 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.080
 a micro SD USB or any drive 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.180
 storage this tutorial had already 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.539
 promised and in addition you had it to me 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 asked so I hope it serves them 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 go to the description of the video and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 download this file we extract it a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 Once they extract it, it will leave you with this 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 folder we open it brings instructions 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.750
 that it is necessary that they read execute the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750
 installer 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 before starting the installation is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.550
 important that they have no connection to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 internet this is so that the program does not 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 be updated because if it is already updated 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.780
 it does not work we give in next we accept 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.780
 the terms and next following 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 following 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 We accept the terms and following 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 following 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.990
 following 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 we give in finalize we open the program 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.549
 before explaining how the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.549
 program I will tackle some files and 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.829
 format in a usb memory as you will see 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.979
 I have these sample files in my 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.600
 memory music images pdf videos and a 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.790
 photoshop file 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 for example I will delete this file from 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.729
 normal way 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.729
 now format and memory 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.070
 I will reformat it and you will see that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.259
 the shape you in several times always 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.799
 will find a file to recover in 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.799
 his memory 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.750
 Once done, let's go back to 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.750
 Program 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.550
 This program allows you to recover files 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.180
 of partitions of the stationery of 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.240
 recycling and memories oo hard drives 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.700
 we select the middle one 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.620
 will throw us memories or hard drives 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.890
 that we have connected or active in 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 our pc I will select mine where 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.840
 delete the files we give in following 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.880
 this will appear and we just have to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.520
 wait for me to finish looking for the files 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.650
 in memory once I finish them 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.700
 leave this window with the memory and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.700
 disk that we scan 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.030
 we give the following 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 here the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.190
 enter the folder called files there 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 the files will be divided according to their 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.430
 type here is the photoshop file 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.739
 that we erase when we become masters 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 here is the base file that we delete 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.560
 here are the photos also found 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.980
 older files that were in the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.980
 memory 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.249
 files that were in memory much 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.409
 before the program in general recovers 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:28.670
 the files in better condition since in 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.069
 poor condition does not show them 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.920
 to recover the files we only have 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.780
 to select them in this way I 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.650
 I will retrieve a couple of files for 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.650
 give them examples 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.250
 we give in following here we select the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 folder where we want to save the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.500
 files that we will recover in my 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.650
 case the desk will show us this and 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.959
 we just have to 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.549
 once it's over we can go back to 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.439
 Search for more files to list or 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.980
 return to the beginning to search more 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.980
 units 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.830
 I will close the program 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.260
 I will leave you a folder where the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.799
 recovered files 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.349
 we open it we enter the folder that 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.480
 bring in there will be our 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.760
 files sorted as they appear in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.010
 the program as you will see the files 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.239
 they are good they have no harm and leaves them 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.239
 open them normally 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.349
 some files can not always be 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.539
 see since they are not 100% there are files 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.720
 older ones that are in perfect 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.720
 state 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.500
 as you will see you can use them as if you never 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.750
 you would have deleted them or lost them so that 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.750
 see that it is very file to open the pdf 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.889
 as you will see it is in perfect condition 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.720
 now I will open the same coffee that I 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.720
 I have in my documents 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.009
 as you will see it is the same and it is the same as 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.620
 which we recover good my friends
