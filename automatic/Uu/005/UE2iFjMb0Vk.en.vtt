around<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.950> roll<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.160> once<00:02:10.069> flip

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
around you put it in roll at once flip

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.750 
around you put it in roll at once flip
it<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> other<00:02:11.370> way

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it the other way

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.819 
it the other way
and<00:02:13.830> pull<00:02:14.830> down<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.659> it's<00:02:16.810> kind<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.409> like<00:02:17.620> that

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
and pull down so it's kind of like that

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.080 
and pull down so it's kind of like that
look<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.099> we<00:02:18.370> were<00:02:18.489> doing<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.790> other<00:02:18.909> day

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
look that we were doing the other day

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.000 
look that we were doing the other day
with<00:02:19.239> our<00:02:19.360> live<00:02:19.510> stream<00:02:19.840> where<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.890> don't

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
with our live stream where you don't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.800 
with our live stream where you don't
take<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> curl<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.209> way<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.360> i'll<00:02:22.659> do

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
take the curl all the way so i'll do

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.300 
take the curl all the way so i'll do
some<00:02:22.959> at<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.140> front<00:02:23.439> so<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.860> can<00:02:24.040> see

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
some at the front so that you can see

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.559 
some at the front so that you can see
here<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> put<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:27.599> roll<00:02:28.599> at<00:02:28.810> once<00:02:30.569> roll

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
here so you put it in roll at once roll

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.860 
here so you put it in roll at once roll
it<00:02:31.690> all<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.959> way<00:02:32.409> back<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.829> other<00:02:32.950> way<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it all the way back the other way and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.589 
it all the way back the other way and
cool<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.940> basically<00:02:37.120> get

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
cool down and you just basically get

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.949 
cool down and you just basically get
this<00:02:37.780> gorgeous<00:02:38.099> vintage<00:02:39.099> style<00:02:39.459> wave<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
this gorgeous vintage style wave and you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.229 
this gorgeous vintage style wave and you
do<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.260> all<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.500> way<00:02:41.680> around<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:43.030> head

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.020 
do that all the way around your head
like<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:47.609> can<00:02:48.609> now<00:02:48.730> they're<00:02:48.909> coming

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
like this I can now they're coming

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.910 
like this I can now they're coming
towards<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.659> vast<00:02:49.870> sections<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.650> gets<00:02:50.829> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
towards the vast sections it gets a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.470 
towards the vast sections it gets a
little<00:02:51.099> bit<00:02:51.310> harder<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:51.819> all<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.060> need<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.299> do

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
little bit harder but all you need to do

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.500 
little bit harder but all you need to do
is<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.780> move<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.409> hair<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.980> way<00:02:54.510> it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
is just move the hair out of the way it

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.009 
is just move the hair out of the way it
doesn't<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.170> be<00:02:56.230> perfect<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
doesn't have to be perfect and if you

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.610 
doesn't have to be perfect and if you
get<00:02:59.139> a<00:02:59.200> curl<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.799> kind<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> shifted<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:01.620> then

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
get a curl just kind of shifted and then

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.610 
get a curl just kind of shifted and then
continue<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> action<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.989> sections<00:03:05.440> of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
continue the action and the sections of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.490 
continue the action and the sections of
hair<00:03:06.209> they<00:03:07.209> don't<00:03:07.389> want<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.599> be<00:03:07.690> too<00:03:07.930> small<00:03:08.200> but

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
hair they don't want to be too small but

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.809 
hair they don't want to be too small but
you<00:03:08.620> also<00:03:08.769> don't<00:03:08.980> want<00:03:09.129> them<00:03:09.340> too<00:03:09.519> chunky

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
you also don't want them too chunky

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.580 
you also don't want them too chunky
because<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.359> really<00:03:10.629> want<00:03:10.810> quite<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> defined

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
because you really want quite a defined

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.589 
because you really want quite a defined
curl<00:03:12.099> really<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> back<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.359> want<00:03:16.540> a

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
curl really at the back you just want a

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.059 
curl really at the back you just want a
little<00:03:16.720> bit<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.079> wave<00:03:17.319> but<00:03:17.590> where<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:17.919> the

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
little bit of a wave but where all the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.500 
little bit of a wave but where all the
action<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.489> at<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.730> front<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.090> really<00:03:19.359> want

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
action is at the front you really want

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.509 
action is at the front you really want
to<00:03:19.599> kind<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.079> in<00:03:20.199> vintage<00:03:20.620> style<00:03:21.040> at

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.490 
to kind of get that in vintage style at
the<00:03:22.180> front<00:03:22.449> because<00:03:22.660> that's<00:03:22.840> kind<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.169> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
the front because that's kind of the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.159 
the front because that's kind of the
shape<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:24.099> where<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:25.209> vintage<00:03:25.599> feel<00:03:25.900> comes

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
shape is where the vintage feel comes

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.650 
shape is where the vintage feel comes
from<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.250> just<00:03:27.459> kind<00:03:27.609> of<00:03:27.669> continue<00:03:28.180> loosely

all the way at the back to start
honestly<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.760> takes<00:03:31.150> five<00:03:31.810> minutes<00:03:33.269> it's

bits before not quite as perfectly

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.819 
bits before not quite as perfectly
curled<00:03:59.430> ok<00:04:00.430> once<00:04:00.639> you've<00:04:00.849> got<00:04:01.060> all<00:04:01.090> your<00:04:01.269> shape

curled ok once you've got all your shape
into<00:04:02.829> playing<00:04:03.069> to<00:04:03.370> know<00:04:03.459> your<00:04:03.639> curl<00:04:04.049> just

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
into playing to know your curl just

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.960 
into playing to know your curl just
spray<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.859> area<00:04:05.980> with<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.370> little<00:04:06.579> bit<00:04:06.669> of<00:04:06.760> hair

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
