00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 when going back to the reaction to everything 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 happening State Department pretends that 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.020
 Ukraine do not detain journalists and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 do not shoot at residential areas 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 official representative of the department 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 jen psaki not doing too well 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
 After all, among journalists, the hall is always 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 there is a mother if not for childhood and sachet 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.960
 this press two moments dzhen all gas 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 Russian so why can't they 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 sell it at the price you want 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.130
 yes but they had agreement discounts in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 exchange for renting a base for a fleet given 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 agreement it was canceled when the Russians 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 occupied the Crimea correctly maybe this is not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 means we have no firm position on 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.399
 this issue and we are going to help 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.200
 Ukraine 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.149
 it's reasonable but you think you can 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.890
 cut Russia the price at which she 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.739
 should supply gas to Ukraine 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.390
 I did not say this if in place 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.600
 US officials who can 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 vouch that everything was so 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 who were there in the military 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.960
 unlikely or you just take it on faith 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 what do ukrainian authorities say 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 there is a personal interest and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 repeat after them matt we of course 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.760
 talking to many people but we don't have 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.909
 of some particular american 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.920
 official why are you so sure 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.100
 that the Russian version is full of distortion 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 Really well, Russian many times 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 already distorted facts no me 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 interested in this particular case 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
 how sure are you that your version 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 true Russian is completely wrong but 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.320
 quite sure in our version of events you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 want to say that the United States with their deep 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 traditions of intelligence gathering 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.659
 now depends on the photos on the Internet 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 and twitter we consider closed and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.600
 public information these photos became 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.829
 public conclusions you can do yourself 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.950
 so you say these photos 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.200
 reinforce secret intelligence data 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.479
 No, I did not say this at all I say 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.840
 that they reinforce our arguments which 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 we have been bringing in a few weeks already 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.590
 a long time working with the Russian 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 Cosmos and I hope it will continue 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 we still continue to operation on 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 a whole series of questions we have 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 lots of materials of the same kind and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.520
 for future collaboration therefore i 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 I hope we can continue 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.450
 working together with Russians you are just 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.450
 don't want to go back in time 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 union apollo 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.959
 we are from you today as a comedian 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.310
 remember this time remember 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.110
 if you have any hay I 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 about possible interpretations of this 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 conflict or cronyism in 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.130
 which you often blame Russians 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.630
 of course not he is a private person okay well you 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.519
 understand then that the Russian and 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.970
 Ukrainian oligarchs who control 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.709
 this area is also private individuals right 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.319
 no matt we certainly wouldn't attribute 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.569
 them to the same electoral category 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.400
 carousel in the treatment of voting children 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.069
 pre-marked bulletins 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.959
 more statement for those who did not come and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.959
 even voting in Moscow and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.060
 Petersburg, sorry maybe I just donâ€™t 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.060
 I see but I first heard about this and that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.739
 it is such a fair carousel honestly 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.170
 saying i read it she doesn't either 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.910
 familiar with this term but it has not 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.739
 attitude to the voting of children is not 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.110
 It means that they all sit on horses and 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.049
 moving in a circle matt it seems to me 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.400
 has a slightly different meaning tell you in 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.500
 course of detention by the Kiev authorities 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.319
 several Russian journalists 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.989
 saw similar messages specifically these 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.370
 I did not see the message 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.620
 okay but there many in russia fear 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.420
 that these guys are detained and that they are 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.819
 would not be released I would like 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.410
 know if now you can already know 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.780
 tell us what you think about this 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.780
 yes yes of course still a question
