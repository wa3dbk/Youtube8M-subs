the<00:01:06.840> reflector<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> take

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the reflector and we're going to take

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.890 
the reflector and we're going to take
two<00:01:08.640> photographs<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.420> show<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.659> the

two photographs to show you the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.340 
two photographs to show you the
difference<00:01:10.530> subtle<00:01:11.340> perhaps<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.570> definitely

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
difference subtle perhaps but definitely

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.210 
difference subtle perhaps but definitely
noticeable

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
noticeable

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
noticeable
and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.790> you'll<00:01:14.909> agree<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> much

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and I think you'll agree one is much

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
and I think you'll agree one is much
more<00:01:15.840> pleasing<00:01:16.350> without<00:01:17.040> benefit<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
more pleasing without benefit of the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.499 
more pleasing without benefit of the
reflector

I'm<00:01:18.869> also<00:01:19.110> should<00:01:19.500> mention<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I'm also should mention I'm going to be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
I'm also should mention I'm going to be
using<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.700> 7300<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:22.170> 200<00:01:22.619> millimeters

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
using my 7300 about 200 millimeters

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
using my 7300 about 200 millimeters
knock<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> background<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.780> because

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
knock the background out that because

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
knock the background out that because

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
field issues and as a result so first

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
field issues and as a result so first
picture<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:31.020> without

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
picture here as you can see without

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.819 
picture here as you can see without
benefit<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> reflector<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.240> look<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.479> that

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
benefit a reflector take a look at that

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.280 
benefit a reflector take a look at that
now<00:01:34.860> yo<00:01:35.430> raise<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> reflector<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:37.079> course

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
now yo raise the reflector up of course

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
now yo raise the reflector up of course
you<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> actual

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you don't want it in the actual

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
you don't want it in the actual
photograph<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.390> shouldn't<00:01:39.720> need<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> tell<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
photograph I shouldn't need to tell you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.390 
photograph I shouldn't need to tell you
that<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> case<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:41.250> wondering

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that but just in case you're wondering

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
that but just in case you're wondering
how<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.909> avoid<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> make<00:01:42.990> sure<00:01:43.170> they

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
how do you avoid that you make sure they

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.330 
how do you avoid that you make sure they
don't<00:01:43.560> bring<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.280> super<00:01:44.759> high<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
don't bring it up super high and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.609 
don't bring it up super high and
so<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.850> overcast<00:01:47.299> bright<00:01:47.659> light<00:01:47.869> fits<00:01:48.409> that

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
so the overcast bright light fits that

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.560 
so the overcast bright light fits that
reflector<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.429> bounces<00:01:49.759> up<00:01:49.909> onto<00:01:50.210> her<00:01:50.329> face

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
reflector and bounces up onto her face

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.950 
reflector and bounces up onto her face
now<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.289> take<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.590> look<00:01:51.710> at<00:01:51.979> number<00:01:52.250> two<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.509> as

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
now we take a look at number two and as

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.099 
now we take a look at number two and as
you<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.409> see<00:01:54.729> side<00:01:55.729> by<00:01:55.939> side<00:01:56.299> which<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:57.079> you

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
you can see side by side which do you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.889 
you can see side by side which do you
