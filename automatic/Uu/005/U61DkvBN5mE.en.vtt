00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.820 
like that
I<00:02:21.250> mean<00:02:22.030> her<00:02:22.210> case<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.660> kind<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.960> unusual<00:02:23.140> she's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
I mean her case is kind of unusual she's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.860 
I mean her case is kind of unusual she's
very<00:02:24.070> high-functioning<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.630> she's<00:02:28.630> had<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
very high-functioning and she's had a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.890 
very high-functioning and she's had a
lot<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.980> financial<00:02:30.700> resources<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.630> deal

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
lot of like financial resources to deal

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.060 
lot of like financial resources to deal
with<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.230> illness<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.830> still

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
with the illness but I think it's still

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.670 
with the illness but I think it's still
valid<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> source<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.540> hope<00:02:37.810> for<00:02:38.620> people

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
valid as a source of hope for people

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.630 
valid as a source of hope for people
with<00:02:39.040> schizophrenia<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.460> know
