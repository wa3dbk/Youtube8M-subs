up the drying process you'll know the

repeat the layering and drying process I

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
repeat the layering and drying process I
did<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.110> four<00:02:19.380> times<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> wouldn't

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
did this four times and I wouldn't

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
did this four times and I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:20.340> any<00:02:20.760> less<00:02:21.030> than<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:21.600> if

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
recommend any less than that because if

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
recommend any less than that because if
it's<00:02:21.990> too<00:02:22.230> thin<00:02:22.530> it'll<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.220> likely<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it's too thin it'll be more likely to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.760 
it's too thin it'll be more likely to
tear<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:24.030> removing<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.600> applying<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
tear when removing it or applying it you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.260 
tear when removing it or applying it you
could<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.100> more<00:02:26.400> than<00:02:26.580> four<00:02:26.790> layers<00:02:27.030> but

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
could do more than four layers but

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.790 
could do more than four layers but
making<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.660> too<00:02:27.810> thick<00:02:27.989> will<00:02:28.110> eliminate<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.560> lot

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
making it too thick will eliminate a lot

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.690 
making it too thick will eliminate a lot
of<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> shape<00:02:29.250> detail<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> face<00:02:31.700> once

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
live cast this is an especially good way

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.080

to<00:02:40.770> sell<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> effect<00:02:41.340> because<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.970> could

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to sell the effect because it could

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.400 
to sell the effect because it could
still<00:02:42.330> look<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.570> lot<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.260> it's
