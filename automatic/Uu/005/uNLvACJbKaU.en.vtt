00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
going to do is you can just set it since

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.500 
going to do is you can just set it since
it's<00:02:39.739> not<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.190> full-size<00:02:40.670> harddrive<00:02:41.209> we're

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it's not a full-size harddrive we're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
it's not a full-size harddrive we're
going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.140> set<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.470> down<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
going to have to just set it down in the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.550 
going to have to just set it down in the
computer<00:02:43.970> somewhere<00:02:44.150> make<00:02:45.050> sure<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.290> flat

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
computer somewhere make sure it's flat

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.979 
computer somewhere make sure it's flat
because<00:02:45.950> there<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> disk<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.870> take<00:02:47.870> this

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
because there is a disk in it take this

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.860 
because there is a disk in it take this
in<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.500> plug<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:50.769> SATA<00:02:52.600> there<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.720> go

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
in and plug it in to SATA there you go

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.380 
in and plug it in to SATA there you go
it's<00:02:54.410> sturdy<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.950> now<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.090> hook<00:02:56.269> up

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's sturdy and now we do is hook up

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.949 
it's sturdy and now we do is hook up
power<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.820> from<00:02:58.820> your<00:02:58.940> power<00:02:59.120> spot<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.720> there

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
power so from your power spot here there

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.500 
power so from your power spot here there
should<00:03:00.079> be<00:03:00.200> cables<00:03:00.590> coming<00:03:00.860> down<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.420> of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
should be cables coming down like one of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.569 
should be cables coming down like one of
these<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:06.079> should<00:03:06.590> look<00:03:06.739> like<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:06.920> SATA<00:03:07.220> cable

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
these it should look like a SATA cable

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.080 
these it should look like a SATA cable
to<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.220> got<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.579> camera<00:03:10.820> guy

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to see that you got that camera guy

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.270 
to see that you got that camera guy
alright<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.350> then<00:03:12.560> what<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.860> don't<00:03:13.010> need<00:03:13.190> to

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
do is just plug it into the power slot

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.229 
do is just plug it into the power slot
really<00:03:15.530> simple<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.340> go<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.880> have<00:03:20.030> that

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
set it down there like this prop up at

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.950 
set it down there like this prop up at
the<00:03:30.400> side<00:03:30.610> back<00:03:30.820> on<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.270> here<00:03:31.540> will<00:03:31.720> show<00:03:31.900> you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
alright we now have a computer plugged

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.080 
alright we now have a computer plugged
in<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.950> hard<00:03:42.190> drive<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.550> just<00:03:42.580> sitting<00:03:42.970> down

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
in the hard drive is just sitting down

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.060 
in the hard drive is just sitting down
there<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.600> we'll<00:03:43.690> turn<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.050> on<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:47.800> will
