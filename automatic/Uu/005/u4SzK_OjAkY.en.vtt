underneath me but not on the edges we've
in<00:00:28.310> near<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.519> middle<00:00:31.629> way<00:00:32.629> loose<00:00:32.899> in<00:00:33.140> here<00:00:35.020> on

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
in near the middle way loose in here on

the outside edge for the tight here what
you<00:00:42.680> don't<00:00:42.859> want<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.160> do<00:00:43.309> is<00:00:44.059> measure<00:00:44.300> across<00:00:44.660> a

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
you don't want to do is measure across a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.049 
you don't want to do is measure across a
hole<00:00:45.109> because<00:00:45.590> it'll<00:00:46.010> go<00:00:46.129> through<00:00:46.340> a<00:00:46.399> hole

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.860 

turn<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.210> at<00:00:50.329> an<00:00:50.480> angle<00:00:50.660> measure<00:00:51.469> again<00:00:52.870> now

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
turn it at an angle measure again now

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.060 
turn it at an angle measure again now
we're<00:00:54.050> loose<00:00:54.199> here

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.410 

I've<00:00:57.550> no<00:00:57.789> -<00:00:57.850> where<00:00:58.149> it's<00:00:58.269> loose<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:01.239> just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
I've no - where it's loose we're just

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.759 
I've no - where it's loose we're just
checking<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.750> loose<00:01:01.989> I'll<00:01:02.260> show<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.500> how<00:01:02.680> to

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
checking for loose I'll show you how to

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.039 
checking for loose I'll show you how to
get<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.039> measurement<00:01:04.830> turn<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:07.689> here

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
get the measurement turn it from here

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
get the measurement turn it from here
check<00:01:09.930> here

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
check here

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:22.459 
check here
check<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.090> 10<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:15.460> drag<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:16.000> straightedge

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.780 

lift<00:01:23.469> is<00:01:23.649> great<00:01:23.860> edge<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.280> leave<00:01:24.430> it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.520 

so<00:01:29.330> we<00:01:29.450> noticed<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.960> have<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> big<00:01:30.320> loose

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
so we noticed that we have a big loose

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.290 
so we noticed that we have a big loose
area<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.010> area<00:01:31.370> here<00:01:31.580> which<00:01:31.760> we<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.150> see

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
area in this area here which we can see

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.520 
area in this area here which we can see
some<00:01:32.480> always<00:01:32.780> hitting<00:01:34.990> put<00:01:35.990> my<00:01:36.110> straightedge

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
some always hitting put my straightedge

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.390 
some always hitting put my straightedge
back<00:01:36.800> this<00:01:36.980> way<00:01:38.620> I'm<00:01:39.620> going<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.860> increase<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
back this way I'm going to increase the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.010 
back this way I'm going to increase the
size<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.940> measured<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.390> earlier<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:41.810> I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
size I measured this earlier so I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.490 
size I measured this earlier so I
actually<00:01:42.140> know<00:01:42.470> about<00:01:42.770> where<00:01:42.980> I'm<00:01:43.070> at<00:01:43.420> there's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
actually know about where I'm at there's

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.460 
actually know about where I'm at there's
14,000<00:01:46.900> slides<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.110> there<00:01:48.230> pretty<00:01:48.440> easily

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
14,000 slides in there pretty easily

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.929 
14,000 slides in there pretty easily
it's<00:01:51.470> time<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.740> get<00:01:51.890> some<00:01:52.070> drag

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.870 

there's<00:01:58.039> 17,000<00:02:00.499> doesn't<00:02:01.499> go<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.429> it's<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there's 17,000 doesn't go so it's just a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.649 
there's 17,000 doesn't go so it's just a
girl<00:02:03.090> logo<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> show<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.509> what

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
girl logo and I just to show just what

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.390 
girl logo and I just to show just what
that<00:02:06.840> would<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> quick<00:02:07.890> check

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.440 

I'm<00:02:11.400> down<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> side<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.299> see

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I'm down to the side and you can see

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.089 
I'm down to the side and you can see
significant<00:02:16.200> light<00:02:16.440> underneath<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
significant light underneath in this

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.930 
significant light underneath in this
area<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.580> move<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
area here and over here if I move it

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.050 
area here and over here if I move it
back<00:02:25.310> near<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> edge<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:29.579> lights<00:02:29.790> pretty

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
back near the edge the lights pretty

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.220 
back near the edge the lights pretty
much<00:02:30.239> gone<00:02:30.450> away

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.410 

I'm<00:02:39.800> back

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.650 

so<00:02:47.960> as<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> quick<00:02:48.440> check
