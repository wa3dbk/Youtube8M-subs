 welcome you to the channel today 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.030
 on the stencil when you buy it 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.970
 There is a protective film that you need 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.989
 take off stencil originally located in 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 package you take it out take out 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.170
 package from the package and to the surface 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.910
 This disc has a film 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.640
 invisible to be removed 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.970
 otherwise, if you do not remove anything 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.570
 it will not work therefore not 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.119
 forget when you get a stencil 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 it doesn't matter expensive cheap it doesn't matter 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.020
 principle they all work the same way 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 it is necessary to remove the top film from them 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 film 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.820
 and then start creating drawings 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 transfer patterns to the nail plate 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.409

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:38.670
