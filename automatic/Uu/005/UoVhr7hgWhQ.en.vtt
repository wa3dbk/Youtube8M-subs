horseradish<00:02:39.950> yeah<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:44.430> quite

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
horseradish yeah like this it's quite

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.069 
horseradish yeah like this it's quite
nice<00:02:44.879> when<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.689> isn't<00:02:45.900> it

nice when it's like that isn't it
because<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.739> think<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:47.159> flavor<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.760> loses

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.179

out<00:02:48.540> when<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.900> cooking<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.530> then<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.069> it

out when it's cooking and then if it

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.619 
out when it's cooking and then if it
gets<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.459> little<00:02:50.579> bit<00:02:50.790> intense<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.299> can<00:02:51.359> always

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
gets a little bit intense you can always
