this<00:02:30.590> works<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.220> all<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.580> them

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.990 

and<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.650> gonna<00:02:46.740> look<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.430> going

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and it's gonna look like so much going

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.620 
and it's gonna look like so much going
into<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> pot<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:50.520> swish<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.360> in

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
into the pot so just swish it down in

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.830 
into the pot so just swish it down in
there<00:02:51.810> without<00:02:52.170> burning<00:02:52.500> yourself<00:02:53.570> it's<00:02:54.570> good

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
there without burning yourself it's good

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.730 
there without burning yourself it's good
to<00:02:54.990> use<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> deep<00:02:55.440> pot<00:02:55.740> like<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.520> I'm<00:02:56.670> using

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
to use a deep pot like like I'm using

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.350 
to use a deep pot like like I'm using
it's<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.040> most<00:02:59.250> greens<00:02:59.580> by<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.150> time

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it's just like most greens by the time

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000 
it's just like most greens by the time
it<00:03:00.480> comes<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.140> looks<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.590> nothing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
it comes down it looks like it's nothing

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.850 
it comes down it looks like it's nothing
all<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> let's<00:03:07.080> cover<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.500> back<00:03:07.650> up

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
all right so let's cover that back up

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.310 
all right so let's cover that back up
for<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> few<00:03:08.370> minutes<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.480> we'll<00:03:10.140> check

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
for a few minutes and then we'll check

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.760 
for a few minutes and then we'll check
on<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.710> start<00:03:11.040> stirring<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.430> around<00:03:12.770> okay

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
on it and start stirring it around okay

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.820 
on it and start stirring it around okay
it's<00:03:13.950> been<00:03:14.040> about<00:03:14.220> four<00:03:14.670> or<00:03:14.790> five<00:03:14.940> minutes<00:03:15.830> I'm

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
it's been about four or five minutes I'm

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.430 
it's been about four or five minutes I'm
gonna<00:03:16.980> take<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.520> top<00:03:17.790> off<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.300> just<00:03:18.660> get<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
gonna take the top off and just get a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.740 
gonna take the top off and just get a
big<00:03:19.650> spoon<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.160> from<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> bottom<00:03:20.750> start

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
big spoon and from the bottom start

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.230 
big spoon and from the bottom start
slowly<00:03:22.500> turning<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.430> around<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.940> want<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
slowly turning it around you want to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.390 
slowly turning it around you want to
make<00:03:24.810> sure<00:03:24.840> all<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> kale<00:03:25.650> gets<00:03:25.950> an<00:03:26.070> even

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
make sure all the kale gets an even

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640 
make sure all the kale gets an even
amount<00:03:26.490> of<00:03:26.730> time<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.050> water<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.530> at

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
amount of time with the water that's at

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.430 
amount of time with the water that's at
the<00:03:28.770> bottom<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.630> you'll<00:03:33.780> notice<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.140> tail<00:03:34.320> on

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the bottom so you'll notice the tail on

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.740 
the bottom so you'll notice the tail on
the<00:03:34.470> bottom<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.950> looking<00:03:35.160> nice<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.640> green<00:03:35.880> so
