order<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:11.120> bend<00:00:11.299> the<00:00:11.420> wall<00:00:11.630> you<00:00:11.990> must<00:00:12.200> bend

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
order to bend the wall you must bend

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.740 
order to bend the wall you must bend
your<00:00:12.590> mind<00:00:12.770> first<00:00:13.129> so<00:00:14.120> really<00:00:14.299> it<00:00:14.480> comes<00:00:14.600> down

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
your mind first so really it comes down

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.900 
your mind first so really it comes down
to<00:00:15.080> an<00:00:15.290> openness<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:16.070> their<00:00:16.279> willingness<00:00:16.430> to

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
try out new ways of doing so I was free

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.120 
try out new ways of doing so I was free
to<00:00:20.180> play<00:00:20.540> with<00:00:20.840> different<00:00:20.960> designs<00:00:21.410> involving

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
to play with different designs involving

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.159 
to play with different designs involving

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
all the shapes occurs because mel and

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.499 
all the shapes occurs because mel and
his<00:00:24.230> crew<00:00:24.590> were<00:00:24.800> free<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.730> be<00:00:25.880> able<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.149> explore

his crew were free to be able to explore

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.540 
his crew were free to be able to explore
ways<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.230> physicalize<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.130> ways<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.250> actually

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
ways to physicalize and ways to actually

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.819 
ways to physicalize and ways to actually
make<00:00:28.820> it<00:00:28.939> happen<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:30.380> simple<00:00:30.739> example

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
make it happen and a simple example

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.250 
make it happen and a simple example
would<00:00:31.309> be<00:00:31.369> where<00:00:31.790> a<00:00:32.090> wall<00:00:32.660> plate<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.200> the

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
would be where a wall plate in the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.920 
would be where a wall plate in the
timber<00:00:33.470> frame<00:00:33.710> structure<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.090> name<00:00:35.899> of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
timber frame structure is the name of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.720 
timber frame structure is the name of
the<00:00:36.110> timber<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.530> sits<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.160> floor<00:00:37.309> on

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
the timber that sits on the floor on

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.340 
the timber that sits on the floor on
which<00:00:37.760> all<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.270> vertical<00:00:38.660> piece<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.989> company

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
which all the vertical piece of company

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.520 
which all the vertical piece of company
so<00:00:40.160> if<00:00:40.339> we<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:40.609> curved<00:00:40.910> wall<00:00:41.210> most<00:00:41.989> framers

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
so if we have a curved wall most framers

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.740 
so if we have a curved wall most framers
would<00:00:42.620> understand<00:00:43.129> imagine<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.449> curve

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
would understand imagine that a curve

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.450 
would understand imagine that a curve
that<00:00:44.989> wall<00:00:45.199> play<00:00:45.379> takes<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.800> lot<00:00:45.949> of<00:00:45.980> effort<00:00:46.339> in

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
that wall play takes a lot of effort in

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.040 
that wall play takes a lot of effort in
time<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:47.089> need<00:00:47.210> an<00:00:47.269> extra<00:00:47.420> white<00:00:47.749> piece<00:00:48.019> of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
time you need an extra white piece of

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.079 
time you need an extra white piece of
timber<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.980> have<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.280> cut<00:00:49.429> it<00:00:49.460> twice<00:00:49.789> for

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
timber you have to cut it twice for

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.119 
timber you have to cut it twice for
instance<00:00:50.359> there's<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.050> lot<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.199> wastage<00:00:51.679> so<00:00:52.070> you

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
instance there's a lot of wastage so you

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.040 
instance there's a lot of wastage so you
see<00:00:52.370> timing<00:00:52.940> see<00:00:53.239> labor<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:53.870> see

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
see timing see labor and you see

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.500 
see timing see labor and you see
materials<00:00:54.589> old<00:00:54.859> I'm<00:00:55.339> cruising<00:00:55.909> over<00:00:56.059> than<00:00:56.359> arm

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
materials old I'm cruising over than arm

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.340 
materials old I'm cruising over than arm
but<00:00:57.499> then<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.399> started<00:00:58.850> creating<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.870> curve<00:01:00.109> from

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
but then I started creating a curve from

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.139 
but then I started creating a curve from
the<00:01:00.469> standard<00:01:00.800> piece<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.159> timber<00:01:01.339> just<00:01:02.030> by

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
the standard piece of timber just by

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.180 
the standard piece of timber just by
cutting<00:01:02.359> it<00:01:02.569> once<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.050> taking<00:01:03.859> the<00:01:03.980> front

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
cutting it once and taking the front

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.190 
cutting it once and taking the front
piece<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.670> putting<00:01:05.150> it<00:01:05.239> on<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.360> back<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.900> it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
piece and putting it on the back and it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440 
piece and putting it on the back and it
works<00:01:06.409> really<00:01:06.650> really<00:01:06.800> well<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:08.150> will<00:01:08.300> see

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
works really really well and we will see

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.270 
works really really well and we will see
that<00:01:08.540> example<00:01:09.020> all<00:01:09.260> over<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> place<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.130> it's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
that example all over the place so it's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.270 
that example all over the place so it's
an<00:01:10.400> efficient<00:01:10.880> way<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.600> creating<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.590> curved

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
an efficient way of creating a curved

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.490 
an efficient way of creating a curved
wall<00:01:13.460> plate<00:01:13.730> which<00:01:14.690> literally<00:01:15.200> everything

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
wall plate which literally everything

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.470 
wall plate which literally everything
else<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.830> vertical<00:01:16.280> standard<00:01:16.850> with<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.270> there

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
else is vertical standard with in there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480 
else is vertical standard with in there
and<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.710> certainly<00:01:18.920> there<00:01:19.160> has<00:01:19.280> been<00:01:19.460> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
and so certainly there has been a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.340 
and so certainly there has been a
learning<00:01:19.670> curve<00:01:20.000> if<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:20.450> pardon<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.810> pun<00:01:21.080> of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
learning curve if you pardon the pun of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.920 
learning curve if you pardon the pun of
the<00:01:21.620> last<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.970> as<00:01:23.060> eight<00:01:23.210> years<00:01:23.480> of<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:23.750> age

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
the last so as eight years of this age

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.760 
the last so as eight years of this age
rather<00:01:24.200> may<00:01:24.500> be<00:01:24.650> related

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
rather may be related

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.459 
rather may be related
and<00:01:26.270> how<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.450> learning<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.929> time<00:01:27.960> I'm

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
and how we're learning all the time I'm

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.980 
and how we're learning all the time I'm
get<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:28.859> push<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.399> as<00:01:29.689> possible<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> guys

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
get off push about as possible the guys

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
get off push about as possible the guys
early<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.979> still<00:01:32.219> join<00:01:32.520> enjoying<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.509> force

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
early and still join enjoying that force

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
early and still join enjoying that force
which<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> key<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> course<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.119> would

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
which is the key and of course it would

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
which is the key and of course it would
be<00:01:36.299> many<00:01:36.479> people<00:01:36.570> who<00:01:36.899> would<00:01:37.110> feel<00:01:37.409> immortal

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
be many people who would feel immortal

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.380 
be many people who would feel immortal
would<00:01:38.369> maybe<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.759> somebody<00:01:39.149> who<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
would maybe know somebody who is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
would maybe know somebody who is
building<00:01:39.569> traditionally<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.439> many<00:01:40.590> years

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
building traditionally for many years

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
building traditionally for many years
and<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.340> would<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.640> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.819> finals<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and they would look at the finals I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.809 
and they would look at the finals I
think<00:01:43.289> it's<00:01:43.679> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> cost<00:01:44.100> three<00:01:44.429> times<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
think it's going to cost three times the

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.609 
think it's going to cost three times the
amount<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.360> gone<00:01:45.569> to<00:01:45.719> that<00:01:45.810> take<00:01:46.110> four<00:01:46.380> times

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
amount it's gone to that take four times

you'd be bright surprisingly enough yes

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.809 
you'd be bright surprisingly enough yes
it<00:02:01.229> does<00:02:01.380> take<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.829> material<00:02:02.340> river<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
it does take more material river and

because you're doing curves of the

because you're doing curves of the
center's<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.920> closer<00:02:05.159> together<00:02:05.399> but

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
center's are closer together but

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.460 
center's are closer together but
surprisingly<00:02:06.420> enough<00:02:06.659> after<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.200> job

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.150 
flow of these houses actually kind of
almost<00:03:34.360> shake<00:03:35.360> themselves<00:03:35.600> or<00:03:36.200> hey<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.710> can

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
almost shake themselves or hey I can

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.710 
almost shake themselves or hey I can
obviously<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.670> got<00:03:37.790> all<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> radiuses<00:03:38.570> in

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
obviously you got all the radiuses in

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.070 
obviously you got all the radiuses in
the<00:03:38.810> different<00:03:39.110> layout<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:40.160> basic<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:42.050> basic

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
the different layout the basic the basic

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.900 
the different layout the basic the basic
structure<00:03:42.710> mounts<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.280> first<00:03:43.520> thing<00:03:43.700> at<00:03:43.820> the

were<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:46.640> seems<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:48.020> way<00:03:48.140> Michael

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
were just seems to the way Michael

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.770 
were just seems to the way Michael
rajavaga<00:03:48.860> just<00:03:49.160> seems<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.490> all<00:03:50.000> four<00:03:50.690> were

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
rajavaga just seems to all four were

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.320 
rajavaga just seems to all four were
together<00:03:50.870> well<00:03:51.530> because<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.100> both<00:03:52.910> design<00:03:53.300> and

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
together well because we both design and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.900 
together well because we both design and
build<00:03:53.900> using<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.680> ratios<00:03:55.100> of<00:03:55.130> nature<00:03:55.580> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
build using the ratios of nature the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.280 
build using the ratios of nature the
stress<00:03:56.210> is<00:03:56.240> naturally<00:03:56.840> follow<00:03:57.080> these

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
stress is naturally follow these

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.610 
stress is naturally follow these
pathways<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.580> we're<00:03:58.700> not<00:03:58.850> looking<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.380> beef<00:04:00.380> up

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
pathways so we're not looking to beef up

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.920 
pathways so we're not looking to beef up
what<00:04:01.580> should<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:02.090> very<00:04:02.330> straightforward

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
what should be a very straightforward

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.540 
what should be a very straightforward
structure<00:04:03.650> with<00:04:03.800> something<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.280> we<00:04:04.370> might

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
structure with something that we might

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.730 
structure with something that we might
feel<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.970> Sakura<00:04:05.360> better<00:04:05.840> put<00:04:06.110> an<00:04:06.230> extra<00:04:06.500> there

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
feel it Sakura better put an extra there

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.710 
feel it Sakura better put an extra there
because<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.190> looks<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.460> little<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:08.450> know<00:04:08.540> that

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
because it looks a little you know that

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.080 
because it looks a little you know that
the<00:04:08.870> shapes<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.290> stress<00:04:09.560> lines<00:04:09.860> from<00:04:10.580> gravity

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090
