00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
to the rest of the game doesn't make

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.679 
to the rest of the game doesn't make
sense<00:02:03.039> why<00:02:03.279> didn't<00:02:03.639> just<00:02:03.789> use<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.299> in-game

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
sense why didn't just use the in-game

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.389 
sense why didn't just use the in-game
engine<00:02:05.200> considering<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.709> it<00:02:05.829> looks<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.249> much

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
engine considering that it looks so much

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.370 
engine considering that it looks so much
better<00:02:06.609> than<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:07.299> crap<00:02:07.569> that<00:02:07.749> they<00:02:07.779> throw<00:02:08.170> on

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
better than this crap that they throw on

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.190 
better than this crap that they throw on
in<00:02:08.649> between<00:02:09.310> action<00:02:09.610> scenes<00:02:10.110> probably<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
in between action scenes probably the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.809 
in between action scenes probably the
best<00:02:11.380> part<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.620> all<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:12.010> easy<00:02:12.400> difficulty

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819
