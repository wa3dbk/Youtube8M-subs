little<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:20.039> different<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> replace<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
little bit different and replace the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.750 
little bit different and replace the
mini-map<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.320> an<00:00:22.560> overhead<00:00:22.949> cam<00:00:23.220> where<00:00:23.609> I'm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
mini-map with an overhead cam where I'm

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.630 
mini-map with an overhead cam where I'm
following<00:00:24.240> myself<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.869> theater<00:00:25.260> mode<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> the

following myself in theater mode and the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
following myself in theater mode and the
reason<00:00:26.849> I'm<00:00:26.939> doing<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.320> find

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
reason I'm doing that is because I find

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
reason I'm doing that is because I find
that<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.699> mini<00:00:29.880> map<00:00:30.060> doesn't<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that the the mini map doesn't show you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
that the the mini map doesn't show you
nearly<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.529> chaotic<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> crazy<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.850> spawns

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
for all as i get somebody with the claim

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490

war here that claim or placement is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020 
war here that claim or placement is
pretty<00:01:04.769> obvious<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> right

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
pretty obvious but if you put it right

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
pretty obvious but if you put it right
in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> spot<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:06.450> i<00:01:06.600> did<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.350> covers<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
in the spot where i did it covers the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
in the spot where i did it covers the
back<00:01:07.950> door<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> also<00:01:08.460> covers<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.970> stairs

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
back door and it also covers the stairs

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
back door and it also covers the stairs
so<00:01:09.630> every<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.920> head<00:01:10.950> into

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so every now and then i will head into

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010 
so every now and then i will head into
one<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> houses<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> basically<00:01:12.570> take

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
one of the houses just to basically take

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
one of the houses just to basically take
a<00:01:13.080> breather<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.350> reset<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.130> relax

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
a breather and you know reset and relax

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.740 
a breather and you know reset and relax
because<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.920> quite<00:01:19.920> chaotic<00:01:20.130> where<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
because this is quite chaotic where you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
because this is quite chaotic where you
know<00:01:21.869> enemies<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.380> spawning<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
know enemies are spawning all around you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
know enemies are spawning all around you
and<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> note<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.869> overhead

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and if you note on the on the overhead

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
and if you note on the on the overhead
cam<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> times<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.670> I'll<00:01:26.790> kill<00:01:26.970> an

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
cam a lot of times when I'll kill an

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.760 
cam a lot of times when I'll kill an
enemy<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.630> spawn<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.439> next

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
enemy they will spawn a right back next

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
enemy they will spawn a right back next
to<00:01:28.920> me<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.939> almost<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.420> idea<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to me so it's almost a good idea just to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
to me so it's almost a good idea just to
post<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.560> wait<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:31.950> they're<00:01:32.369> coming

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
post up and wait because they're coming

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
post up and wait because they're coming
back<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:32.939> their<00:01:33.090> revenge<00:01:33.299> kill<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.009> was

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
back for their revenge kill and as I was

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
back for their revenge kill and as I was
saying<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.460> used<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> play<00:01:35.820> free<00:01:36.240> throw<00:01:36.450> more

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
saying I used to play free throw more

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.380 
saying I used to play free throw more
and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:38.310> admit<00:01:38.430> i<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> sound<00:01:39.119> tour

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and I will admit i was a sound tour

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
and I will admit i was a sound tour
right<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.799> bad<00:01:41.009> claim<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.460> placement

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
right here at bad claim or placement

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.889 
right here at bad claim or placement
actually<00:01:42.210> should<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.450> picked<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
actually should have picked it up and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
actually should have picked it up and
moved<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> which<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> nice<00:01:43.710> feature<00:01:43.850> but

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
moved it which is a nice feature but

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.690 
manage to stay alive you have to have to
give<00:05:57.080> up<00:05:57.110> scavenger<00:05:57.740> so<00:05:58.039> you<00:05:58.099> may<00:05:58.340> run<00:05:58.520> out<00:05:58.580> of

give up scavenger so you may run out of

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.570 
give up scavenger so you may run out of
ammo<00:05:58.910> and<00:05:59.240> with<00:06:00.020> warlord<00:06:00.470> I<00:06:00.680> like<00:06:01.250> running<00:06:01.400> a

silencer<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.360> also<00:06:02.539> gives<00:06:02.810> me<00:06:02.990> the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
silencer and that also gives me the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.379 
silencer and that also gives me the
ability<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.560> run<00:06:03.680> dual<00:06:03.979> mags<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.639> on<00:06:05.270> all

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
weapons when you encrypt dual mags that

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.180 
weapons when you encrypt dual mags that
also<00:06:07.970> acts<00:06:08.510> kinda<00:06:09.320> like<00:06:09.470> sleight<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.770> hand<00:06:10.039> on

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
also acts kinda like sleight of hand on

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.400 
also acts kinda like sleight of hand on
your<00:06:10.310> first<00:06:10.610> roommate<00:06:11.000> so<00:06:11.360> you<00:06:11.900> can<00:06:12.050> see<00:06:12.229> those

your first roommate so you can see those
fast<00:06:12.680> reloads<00:06:13.130> and<00:06:13.340> then<00:06:13.550> when<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:13.849> have<00:06:14.000> a

fast reloads and then when you have a

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.610 
fast reloads and then when you have a
period<00:06:14.419> of<00:06:14.450> time<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.900> just<00:06:15.110> sit<00:06:15.200> and<00:06:15.380> take

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
period of time to just sit and take

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.620

cover<00:06:15.860> fire<00:06:16.460> off<00:06:16.669> a<00:06:16.700> couple<00:06:16.910> of<00:06:17.120> shots<00:06:17.330> and

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
cover fire off a couple of shots and

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.450 
cover fire off a couple of shots and
then<00:06:17.960> do<00:06:18.169> the<00:06:18.320> slower<00:06:18.590> reload<00:06:19.039> and<00:06:19.220> get<00:06:19.310> back

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
then do the slower reload and get back

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.400 
then do the slower reload and get back
in<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.700> action<00:06:19.849> so<00:06:20.570> then<00:06:20.720> you<00:06:20.810> kind<00:06:21.169> of<00:06:21.260> have

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
in the action so then you kind of have

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.469 
in the action so then you kind of have
the<00:06:21.500> benefit<00:06:21.860> of<00:06:21.889> sleight<00:06:22.190> of<00:06:22.220> hand<00:06:22.520> with<00:06:23.360> an

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
the benefit of sleight of hand with an

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.760 
the benefit of sleight of hand with an
SMG<00:06:23.780> you're<00:06:24.020> not<00:06:24.139> going<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.320> be<00:06:24.380> aiming<00:06:24.650> down

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
SMG you're not going to be aiming down

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.740 
SMG you're not going to be aiming down
sights<00:06:24.830> as<00:06:25.250> much<00:06:25.400> anyway<00:06:25.760> so<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:26.539> know<00:06:26.630> the

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
sights as much anyway so you know the

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.080 
sights as much anyway so you know the
faster<00:06:27.110> 80s<00:06:27.500> isn't<00:06:27.830> as<00:06:27.919> big<00:06:28.070> of<00:06:28.099> a<00:06:28.250> deal<00:06:28.400> but

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
faster 80s isn't as big of a deal but

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.180 
faster 80s isn't as big of a deal but
you<00:06:29.210> can<00:06:29.330> also<00:06:29.479> run<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:29.990> silencer<00:06:30.620> with<00:06:30.979> your

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
you can also run a silencer with your

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.610 
you can also run a silencer with your
extended<00:06:31.610> mags<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:32.120> I<00:06:32.990> find<00:06:33.380> that<00:06:33.500> that's

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
extended mags and I find that that's

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.390 
extended mags and I find that that's
worked<00:06:34.099> out<00:06:34.250> pretty<00:06:34.370> well<00:06:34.520> for<00:06:34.669> me

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
worked out pretty well for me

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.909 
worked out pretty well for me
the<00:06:36.270> sound<00:06:36.509> of<00:06:36.630> my<00:06:36.690> own<00:06:36.720> footsteps<00:06:37.169> are<00:06:37.650> pretty

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
the sound of my own footsteps are pretty

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.350 
the sound of my own footsteps are pretty
distracting<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:38.610> I've<00:06:38.699> still<00:06:38.970> been<00:06:39.000> running

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
distracting so I've still been running

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.120 
distracting so I've still been running
ninja<00:06:39.690> pro<00:06:39.870> even<00:06:40.259> though<00:06:40.380> that's<00:06:40.590> kind<00:06:40.949> of<00:06:41.040> a
