 take a bank note and draw 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.830
 a strip on paper whose width will be 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 equal to the width of the bill from the edge you need 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.540
 retreat approximately 2 centimeters indent 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.269
 need for it to be possible 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.309
 draw here such teeth we draw 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.159
 similar teeth on the opposite 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.809
