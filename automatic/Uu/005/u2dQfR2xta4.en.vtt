00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.210 

now<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.960> know<00:02:13.050> last<00:02:13.440> week<00:02:13.590> when<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.920> did<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
now I know last week when I did the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.340 
now I know last week when I did the
seated<00:02:14.580> row<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> hammer<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.600> had<00:02:16.080> four

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
seated row in the hammer I had four

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.160 
seated row in the hammer I had four
wheels<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.770> inside<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.570> right<00:02:18.870> for

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
wheels on inside that was just right for

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.560 
wheels on inside that was just right for
probably<00:02:19.560> 15<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.190> 20<00:02:20.490> Brett<00:02:20.850> for<00:02:21.120> sense<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
probably 15 to 20 Brett for sense that I

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.020 
probably 15 to 20 Brett for sense that I
did<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> completely<00:02:23.490> different

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
did this is a completely different

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
did this is a completely different
approach<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> back<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.710> don't<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.040> to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
approach to the back you don't get to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.850 
approach to the back you don't get to
use<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.670> much<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.810> back<00:02:28.140> muscles<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.800> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
use as much of the back muscles that you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.070 
use as much of the back muscles that you
do<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.490> seated<00:02:29.790> row<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> cut<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:30.990> half

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
do on the seated row so I cut it in half

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.630 
do on the seated row so I cut it in half
it<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> little<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.190> light<00:02:32.400> when<00:02:32.580> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
it was just a little bit light when I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040 
it was just a little bit light when I
had<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.360> quarter<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:33.960> up
