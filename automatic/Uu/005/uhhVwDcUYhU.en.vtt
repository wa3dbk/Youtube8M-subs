00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
ensure that was just a quick intro i

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.260 
ensure that was just a quick intro i
made<00:01:50.650> for<00:01:51.310> them<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.820> i<00:01:51.850> could<00:01:51.970> let<00:01:52.150> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
made for them just so i could let you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.620 
made for them just so i could let you
guys<00:01:52.480> know<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.740> website<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.730> their<00:01:55.300> actual

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
guys know the website and their actual

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.320 
guys know the website and their actual
name<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.260> what<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.970> tell<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.210> that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
name and what not want to tell you that

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.150 
name and what not want to tell you that
we're<00:01:58.660> going<00:01:58.810> over<00:01:59.230> there<00:01:59.350> okay<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.620> anyway<00:02:00.010> I

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
we're going over there okay so anyway I

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.460 
we're going over there okay so anyway I
use<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.000> m21<00:02:01.480> EBR<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:02.020> little<00:02:02.200> bit<00:02:02.290> more

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
use the m21 EBR a little bit more

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.870 
use the m21 EBR a little bit more
because<00:02:02.590> it's<00:02:02.830> more<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.100> close-range

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
because it's more of a close-range

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.520 
because it's more of a close-range
weapon<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.540> can<00:02:04.690> actually<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:05.020> safe<00:02:05.260> with

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
weapon to you can actually be safe with

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.070 
weapon to you can actually be safe with
so<00:02:05.860> if<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.340> yourself<00:02:06.460> into<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.510> spotlight

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
so if you get yourself into a spotlight

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.030 
so if you get yourself into a spotlight
so<00:02:08.350> yeah<00:02:08.550> play<00:02:09.550> Marcos<00:02:09.970> off<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:10.510> nobody<00:02:11.040> dies

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
so yeah play Marcos off but nobody dies

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530 
so yeah play Marcos off but nobody dies
then<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.760> actually<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.270> camp

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
then you can actually just kind of camp

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.140 
then you can actually just kind of camp
wherever<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:13.990> are<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.590> use<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> m21<00:02:15.820> for

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
wherever you are and use the m21 for

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.080 
wherever you are and use the m21 for
kind<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.020> like<00:02:17.110> covered<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.560> uses<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> no<00:02:18.790> scope

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
kind of like covered it uses a no scope

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.730 
kind of like covered it uses a no scope
rifle<00:02:19.390> thing<00:02:19.780> that's<00:02:19.960> what<00:02:20.170> really<00:02:20.560> works

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
rifle thing that's what really works

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.010 
rifle thing that's what really works
well<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.400> been<00:02:22.150> using<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.570> gun<00:02:22.780> on

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
well with it I been using that gun on

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.750 
well with it I been using that gun on
like<00:02:23.410> really<00:02:23.650> close<00:02:23.770> range<00:02:24.160> maps<00:02:24.490> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
like really close range maps and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.000 
like really close range maps and
actually<00:02:25.060> been<00:02:25.210> doing<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.750> well<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.560> on

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
actually been doing really well and on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
actually been doing really well and on
the<00:02:27.130> top<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.490> my<00:02:27.580> team<00:02:27.850> at<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.360> time<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.780> you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the top of my team at the time so you

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200 
the top of my team at the time so you
can<00:02:29.350> actually<00:02:29.440> pull<00:02:30.310> off<00:02:30.430> some<00:02:30.640> clutch<00:02:30.880> kills

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
can actually pull off some clutch kills

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.790 
can actually pull off some clutch kills
up<00:02:31.420> closer<00:02:31.720> that's<00:02:31.990> not<00:02:32.260> you're<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.590> totally

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
up closer that's not you're not totally

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.380 
up closer that's not you're not totally
defenseless<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.640> some<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.970> these<00:02:34.090> guns

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
defenseless with some of these guns

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.540 
defenseless with some of these guns
because<00:02:35.020> no<00:02:35.290> scoping<00:02:35.740> in<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:35.980> game<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> lot

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
because no scoping in this game is a lot

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640 
because no scoping in this game is a lot
more<00:02:36.760> difficult<00:02:37.720> than<00:02:37.780> playing<00:02:38.200> them<00:02:38.440> and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
more difficult than playing them and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.010 
more difficult than playing them and
this<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.130> actual<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> stupid<00:02:40.360> mistake<00:02:40.630> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
accurate I'll s why i like it it's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.570 
accurate I'll s why i like it it's
really<00:04:27.610> accurate<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.510> like<00:04:28.600> an<00:04:28.690> Uzi<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.920> it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
really accurate it's like an Uzi but it

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.640 
really accurate it's like an Uzi but it
has<00:04:30.790> an<00:04:31.000> almost<00:04:31.150> no<00:04:31.540> recoil<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.350> one<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.590> my

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
has an almost no recoil it's one of my

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.770 
has an almost no recoil it's one of my
more<00:04:32.800> favorite<00:04:32.860> secondary<00:04:33.490> guns<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.660> the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
more favorite secondary guns but the

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.840 
more favorite secondary guns but the
only<00:04:34.990> drawback<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:36.130> has<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> short

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
only drawback is that it has a short

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.910 
only drawback is that it has a short
clip<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.390> if<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.900> get<00:04:38.020> yourself<00:04:38.260> caught<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.890> a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
clip and if you get yourself caught in a

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.310 
clip and if you get yourself caught in a
position<00:04:39.130> where<00:04:39.310> two<00:04:39.910> people<00:04:40.090> come<00:04:40.450> in<00:04:40.660> you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
position where two people come in you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.580 
position where two people come in you
might<00:04:41.500> be<00:04:41.820> killed<00:04:42.820> because<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.080> very

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
might be killed because of the very

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.710 
might be killed because of the very
short<00:04:44.860> clip<00:04:45.130> size<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.670> getting<00:04:46.240> extended

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720
