00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.689
 hello friends with a game totally 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.910
 different yes gentlemen let's play 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.620
 fayt nights to freddy and many of 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 you will know this game and so 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.820
 they know what it is about and for those who do not 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.310
 prepare to suffer because we are going to 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.910
 have to write 5 nights in a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.250
 pizzeria where possibly these bears 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.660
 Affectionately come alive to try 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.100
 murder us or maybe we're not going to play 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.900
 this game and many of you maybe 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.460
 know him I'll start from the second 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.199
 night and then as you can see 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.229
 we have to survive from 12 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.539
 early morning until 5 in the morning and 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:43.629
 well as taking care of a pizzeria where 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.230
 possibly attack us a little eyes 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.230
 they come alive 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 friends the phone rings the one who calls 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.220
 these early hours of the morning to ask 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 pizza we've closed them commented good 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.559
 here I will show you we have then 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.400
 our camera panel these three 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.540
 Bears good a bear a chick and a 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.540
 colleague calls him 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.280
 but the truth is what it says 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 then let's flip the call and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.430
 I told them we are going to traffic these 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.740
 three bears that are going to come to attack us 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.840
 well in a new moment when they 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.420
 decide to come alive and here down to God 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.000
 Mine, what is this girl that root down here? 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.040
 to piety down here to the side 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020
 left or they say provide for them is what 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.400
 that we have no battery, because if 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.110
 we use the camera a lot 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 is going to finish the battery and then we do not 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.320
 we will be able to defend our 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 Two hundred affectionate ones that are going to us 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.640
 attack because then with energy is that 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.050
 we will be able to be realistic doors or 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 maybe turn on the lights to look 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.740
 who is out there or out there 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.850
 well so far you did not hear anything 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.280
 supposedly hear some steps and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.320
 I was just starting to walk, there's only one left 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.409
 there the chick is already in the kitchen 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.600
 where is the other are three only up 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.450
 the moment I have seen two 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.819
 or how will I be here 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 It's not good, my God 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.280
 it's nice it's in the rabbit the rabbit 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 It's getting close 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.860
 they are in 1a 1b in 5 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.209
 good you have to save battery we have 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.519
 to endure until 5 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.050
 this hour in one we do not have 81% 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.670
 more or less we have to do calculations 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 if at 3 o'clock in the morning we still 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.010
 is 50% of the energy we can 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.989
 survive and you can complete our 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 mission with success is not just we are 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.140
 in level 2 it is supposed to be 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.910
 easy but I did not get through here 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 still 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.400
 let's see if there is still the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.320
 chick is there and this one that looks at me with 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.450
 Ugly face is still there we will have 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.670
 What to expect another time 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.770
 I had looked around this because some 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.610
 that if we press the nose of the bear 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.520
 it sounds we call it let's invoke the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.520
 wrong step let's look where it comes 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.060
 where 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 you see before the cameras with you and 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.010
 place here the cameras do not care 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.970
 and we have lost energy in the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.950
 cameras 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.660
 let's look, I've lost sight of the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.690
 rabbit 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.490
 but if you're already here in the cellar it's very 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.260
 near here I am 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.720
 my god 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.090
 there's 1 2 3 the bunny rabbit is 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.879
 fencing we can open the extra 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.239
 is a bit slow mine the head of 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.830
 confusion but the milestones is still there this 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.650
 follow here 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.360
 and where is there is the chicken we have 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.580
 until the security moment are the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.110
 two in the morning 63% battery we have 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.270
 to keep the damn battery of 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.800
 curse and this fan if I 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.400
 we could turn off we could observe a 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.400
 little more energy 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.920
 this moment I still do not hear anything 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.200
 he had listened to us the steps of 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.549
 listen here for the left part 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.650
 what's scary what we have to go 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.320
 is still there curse you have to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.960
 leave because I'm running out of battery 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.830
 where 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.479
 where is it but here is the chicken here 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.699
 is the only bear is attacking the 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.410
 damn rabbit that is here still very 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.810
 well rabbit are you going to make me run out 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.020
 the battery and it's 2 in the morning and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.340
 we barely have 53 percent energy 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.530
 excellent what we will not achieve to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 survive let's look on the right 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.940
 nothing on the left 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.229
 today is there the damn come run 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.229
 fast reindeer please 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.980
 they hear voices 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.169
 they are not voices there is still the damn 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.099
 what happens is that if you open the door what 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.099
 Most likely that goal 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.970
 not for anything in the world are already three of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.620
 the morning will not reach us 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.360
 battery we have already consumed more than 5 per 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.820
 percent of what we would see 6 percent 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.440
 that we should consume the most 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.440
 possible is that they come from the left 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.610
 you have to keep it away here this 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.229
 the other one has moved 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.310
 comes on the right the safest for 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.310
 7 where they are another curse 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.779
 is in the kitchen 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.860
 I hear noises from the kitchen that the only 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:53.639
 camera where we have the audios 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:55.790
 and that's how this energy was, but I think 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.930
 it's good 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.410
 we go to 4 oh my god comes at 6 in 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.410
 those that we do not have 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:13.840
 we only have audio an edition and where 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.840
 there is the danger 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.080
 danger 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.889
 the cameras began to feel 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.889
 condition 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.410
 I hear from the right 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.410
 or also on the left 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.890
 my god is near 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:42.740
 the chick is here the most 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:45.470
 there is the chicken curse no no no 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.640
 I can learn this but, but as 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.290
 I want I can say excellent what 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.420
 we go there because if you come for this 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.850
 new can use 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.220
 but I'm pressing an optimal 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.220
 damn last the damn door 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.580
 we have a list 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.750
 the chick is there 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.750
 the core is not here and he is there 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.760
 jesus but if they were all three 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.320
 youtube and all three were on camera 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.320
 how he again scared curse 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.220
 we have lost we will have to try 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.460
 on another occasion but how is it possible if 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.830
 is that I had all additions is 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.740
 very fair 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.690
 then I'm going to survive today 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.080
 we will try another occasion but 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.790
 friends of videos like these and if not then 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.890
 just me your comments that I play 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:56.080
 would recommend me to use it all and 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:58.650
 see you in the next regards 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.650
 and
