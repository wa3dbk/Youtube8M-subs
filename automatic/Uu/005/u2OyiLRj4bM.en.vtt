starting<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.149> use<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.329> more<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

come in does always come into black it
comes<00:05:19.950> in<00:05:20.130> pink<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:21.150> comes<00:05:21.360> in<00:05:21.600> orange<00:05:22.700> so

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
comes in pink and it comes in orange so

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
far does not come in a glaze which is

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.510 
far does not come in a glaze which is
your<00:05:27.169> you're<00:05:28.169> like<00:05:28.380> tannish<00:05:28.950> color<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.310> think

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
your you're like tannish color I think

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.770 
your you're like tannish color I think
they<00:05:29.580> should<00:05:29.729> definitely<00:05:30.060> do<00:05:30.180> one<00:05:30.360> in<00:05:30.510> tan

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
they should definitely do one in tan

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.870 
they should definitely do one in tan
because<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.710> will<00:05:31.770> be<00:05:31.890> kind<00:05:32.100> of<00:05:32.130> cool<00:05:32.310> it

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
because that will be kind of cool it

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.490 
because that will be kind of cool it
will<00:05:33.000> be<00:05:33.120> exactly<00:05:33.300> like<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:34.080> average<00:05:34.229> dog

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
will be exactly like the average dog

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.279 
will be exactly like the average dog
that<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.919> see<00:05:35.190> but<00:05:36.150> anyway<00:05:36.450> that's<00:05:36.690> not<00:05:36.900> a
