00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the keyboard and I was like where the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630 
the keyboard and I was like where the
heck<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.630> windows<00:02:01.140> lock<00:02:01.500> key<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> way

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
heck is the windows lock key but the way

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.999 
heck is the windows lock key but the way
you<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.719> 9200<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.799> hold<00:02:04.920> down

you do it on the 9200 is you hold down
the<00:02:05.189> function<00:02:05.579> key<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.360> press<00:02:06.630> the

the function key and then press the
windows<00:02:07.170> key<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.619> actually<00:02:08.280> really<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
WASD and arrow keys one color and then

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.180 
WASD and arrow keys one color and then
change<00:03:00.599> all<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.110> other<00:03:01.230> keys<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> separate

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
change all the other keys to a separate

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
change all the other keys to a separate
color<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.780> we've<00:03:03.930> got<00:03:03.989> kind

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
color so you can see here we've got kind

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.890 
color so you can see here we've got kind
of<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.440> dual<00:03:04.739> led<00:03:05.310> configuration<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.780> is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
of a dual led configuration and this is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
of a dual led configuration and this is
really<00:03:07.140> great<00:03:07.319> because<00:03:07.470> other<00:03:08.190> gaming

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
really great because other gaming

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.089 
really great because other gaming
keyboards<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:09.299> seen<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.810> WASD<00:03:10.319> Keys<00:03:10.829> will

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
keyboards I've seen the WASD Keys will

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.860 
keyboards I've seen the WASD Keys will
light<00:03:11.280> up<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.610> that's<00:03:11.849> great<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.540> then<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
light up and that's great but then the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.390 
light up and that's great but then the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
you kind of have to calibrate in the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.259 
you kind of have to calibrate in the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
right I'm on a SD where's my other hand

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.729 
right I'm on a SD where's my other hand
going<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.639> sometimes<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.750> know<00:03:33.870> typos<00:03:34.440> occur

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
going and sometimes you know typos occur

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.160 
going and sometimes you know typos occur
so<00:03:35.190> Roosevelts<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:35.970> made<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.569> moves<00:03:36.810> to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
so Roosevelts really made the moves to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.930 
so Roosevelts really made the moves to
kind<00:03:37.859> of<00:03:37.889> finding<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.220> solution<00:03:38.639> for<00:03:38.790> this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
kind of finding a solution for this

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.520 
kind of finding a solution for this
problem<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.900> seems<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.319> such<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
problem and it just seems like such a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.770 
problem and it just seems like such a
simple<00:03:40.769> solution<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.430> no<00:03:42.150> one's<00:03:42.329> been<00:03:42.510> doing

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
simple solution but no one's been doing

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.259 
simple solution but no one's been doing
it<00:03:42.930> until<00:03:43.769> now<00:03:43.950> right<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.060> cool

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
it until now right so it's really cool

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.729 
it until now right so it's really cool
functionality<00:03:45.690> I'd<00:03:46.200> say<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.560> probably

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
functionality I'd say this is probably

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.620 
functionality I'd say this is probably
the<00:03:47.010> paramount<00:03:47.489> feature<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.389> keyboard

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
the paramount feature of this keyboard

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.470 
the paramount feature of this keyboard
and<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.319> gonna<00:03:49.440> save<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:50.010> lot<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.430> headache<00:03:50.730> in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
and it's gonna save a lot of headache in

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.449 
and it's gonna save a lot of headache in
the<00:03:51.630> long<00:03:51.810> run<00:03:52.079> with<00:03:52.350> with<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.920> users<00:03:53.250> that

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
the long run with with the users that

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.129 
the long run with with the users that
decide<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.819> get<00:03:54.030> one<00:03:54.239> aside<00:03:54.720> from<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.900> you've

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
decide to get one aside from that you've

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.930 
decide to get one aside from that you've
also<00:03:55.290> got<00:03:55.620> three<00:03:55.889> levels<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.370> LED<00:03:56.730> brightness

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
also got three levels of LED brightness

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.640 
also got three levels of LED brightness
that<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:57.510> choose<00:03:57.720> from<00:03:57.900> from<00:03:58.349> dim

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
that you can choose from from dim

that you can choose from from dim
brighter<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.700> brightest<00:04:00.209> you've<00:04:00.810> also<00:04:00.930> got<00:04:01.139> a

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
brighter and brightest you've also got a

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.170 
brighter and brightest you've also got a
breathing<00:04:01.950> mode<00:04:02.160> which<00:04:02.400> kind<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.609> induces<00:04:03.060> a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
breathing mode which kind of induces a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.000 
breathing mode which kind of induces a
slow<00:04:03.540> pulsating<00:04:04.049> effect<00:04:04.470> between<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
slow pulsating effect between the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.349 
slow pulsating effect between the
brightness<00:04:05.340> levels<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:05.880> keys

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
brightness levels of your keys

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.910 
brightness levels of your keys
looks<00:04:06.660> pretty<00:04:06.810> cool<00:04:07.079> now<00:04:07.470> with<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.739> said

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
looks pretty cool now with all that said

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.800 
looks pretty cool now with all that said
this<00:04:08.310> keyboard<00:04:08.700> has<00:04:08.790> really<00:04:09.150> impressed<00:04:09.419> me<00:04:09.569> up

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
this keyboard has really impressed me up

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.750 
this keyboard has really impressed me up
to<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.019> point<00:04:10.290> but<00:04:10.889> one<00:04:11.069> critique<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.519> will

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
to this point but one critique I will

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.000 
to this point but one critique I will
say<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.870> num<00:04:13.049> lock<00:04:13.200> caps<00:04:13.620> lock<00:04:13.829> and

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
say is that the num lock caps lock and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.710 
say is that the num lock caps lock and
scroll<00:04:14.310> lock<00:04:14.459> LED<00:04:14.910> indicator<00:04:15.329> lights<00:04:15.599> for

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
scroll lock LED indicator lights for

scroll lock LED indicator lights for
this<00:04:16.109> keyboard<00:04:17.039> are<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.579> blue<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.450> just

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
this keyboard are in blue and I just

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.029 
this keyboard are in blue and I just
kind<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.900> wish<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.079> Rosewell<00:04:19.620> would<00:04:19.889> have

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
kind of wish that Rosewell would have

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.219 
kind of wish that Rosewell would have
practiced<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.030> little<00:04:21.269> bit<00:04:21.390> more<00:04:21.570> continuity

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
practiced a little bit more continuity

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.020 
practiced a little bit more continuity
with<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> aesthetic<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> keyboard<00:04:23.880> by

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
with the aesthetic of the keyboard by

either<00:04:24.180> making<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.630> LEDs<00:04:25.020> red<00:04:25.380> or

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
either making the LEDs red or

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.900 
either making the LEDs red or
or<00:04:26.139> even<00:04:26.410> better<00:04:26.530> allow<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.639> switch

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
or even better allow you to switch

or even better allow you to switch
between<00:04:27.940> different<00:04:28.690> colors<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.229> would<00:04:29.350> more

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
between different colors that would more

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.740 
between different colors that would more
appropriately<00:04:30.370> match<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:31.060> current<00:04:31.360> ones<00:04:31.540> on

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
appropriately match the current ones on

let's just quickly recap some of the
pros<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.110> cons<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.770> keyboard<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.370> really

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
pros and cons of the keyboard I really

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.400 
pros and cons of the keyboard I really
like<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.060> slim<00:04:37.300> profile<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.110> durable

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
like the slim profile and the durable

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.010 
like the slim profile and the durable

construction the removable USB cable

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.629 
construction the removable USB cable
from<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.289> back<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> great<00:04:42.009> addition<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
from the back is a great addition to the

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.270 
from the back is a great addition to the
RK<00:04:43.030> series<00:04:43.449> but<00:04:44.139> let's<00:04:44.560> face<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.800> guys<00:04:45.039> the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
RK series but let's face it guys the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.529 
RK series but let's face it guys the
number<00:04:45.370> one<00:04:45.610> feature<00:04:45.820> here<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.300> definitely

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
number one feature here is definitely

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.810 
number one feature here is definitely
the<00:04:46.840> dual<00:04:46.990> LEDs<00:04:47.500> not<00:04:48.070> only<00:04:48.250> does<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.430> allow<00:04:48.580> for

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
the dual LEDs not only does it allow for

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.430 
the dual LEDs not only does it allow for
more<00:04:48.940> customized<00:04:49.389> ability<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.050> killer

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
more customized ability and killer

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.800 
more customized ability and killer
aesthetics<00:04:51.009> but<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.669> offers<00:04:52.030> such<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> high<00:04:52.539> a

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
much higher level of functionality than

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.129 
much higher level of functionality than
you<00:04:54.820> would<00:04:54.910> get<00:04:55.030> from<00:04:55.090> most<00:04:55.419> gaming<00:04:55.750> keyboards

you would get from most gaming keyboards
on<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.350> market<00:04:56.680> currently<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.280> really<00:04:57.729> hope<00:04:57.880> to
