big of a deal i don't care about it i'd
rather<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.719> machine<00:00:37.170> spirit<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
rather have machine spirit because on a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.490 
rather have machine spirit because on a
three<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.149> glance<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.750> vehicle<00:00:40.079> anyways

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
three you can glance the vehicle anyways

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.979 
three you can glance the vehicle anyways
and<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> three<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.210> technically<00:00:42.690> still

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and on a three you can technically still

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
and on a three you can technically still
destroy<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> p1<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
destroy because it's a p1 so you just

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.420 
destroy because it's a p1 so you just
don't<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> additional<00:00:45.930> d6<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> ap1

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
don't get the additional d6 that the ap1

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.360 
don't get the additional d6 that the ap1
still<00:00:47.670> goes<00:00:47.820> through<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.219> not

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
still goes through so to me that's not

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.590 
still goes through so to me that's not
that<00:00:50.489> big<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.879> deal<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.390> flying

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that big of a deal and if you're flying

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
that big of a deal and if you're flying
up<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> table<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.260> probably<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.770> shot<00:00:52.980> down

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
up the table it's probably get shot down

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
up the table it's probably get shot down
by<00:00:53.190> last<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:54.090> equivalent<00:00:54.629> before<00:00:54.840> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

of<00:01:33.060> how<00:01:33.299> i<00:01:33.360> feel<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.900> ship<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.530> not

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of how i feel about this ship it's not

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.469 
of how i feel about this ship it's not
bad<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:35.909> some<00:01:36.030> things<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> there

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
bad but there's some things on there

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.359 
bad but there's some things on there
that<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.900> doesn't<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.229> sense<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.560> me<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that it just doesn't make sense to me so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
that it just doesn't make sense to me so
the<00:01:38.490> sky<00:01:38.700> hammer<00:01:38.880> missile<00:01:39.210> launcher<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> one

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the sky hammer missile launcher is one

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
the sky hammer missile launcher is one
of<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.340> nothing<00:01:41.520> special<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.060> an

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of them it has nothing special just an

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
of them it has nothing special just an
extra<00:01:42.570> shot<00:01:42.750> auto<00:01:43.380> cannon<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.860> shoots<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
extra shot auto cannon that shoots you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.830 
extra shot auto cannon that shoots you
know<00:01:44.640> 60<00:01:45.270> inches<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.920> aerial<00:01:47.189> assault<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.060> can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
know 60 inches the aerial assault it can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
know 60 inches the aerial assault it can
move<00:01:49.079> 12<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> fire<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> its<00:01:50.280> weapons

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
move 12 and fire all of its weapons

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
move 12 and fire all of its weapons
that's<00:01:50.850> good<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.899> escort<00:01:52.320> craft<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.860> would

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
that's good the escort craft I would

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.910 
that's good the escort craft I would
basically<00:01:53.220> only<00:01:53.850> use<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.840> outflank<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
basically only use it to outflank I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.080 
basically only use it to outflank I
wouldn't<00:01:56.219> come<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:56.520> no<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.790> reserves

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
wouldn't come through no more reserves

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.340 
wouldn't come through no more reserves
with<00:01:57.299> another<00:01:57.540> unit<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:57.960> anything<00:01:58.170> else<00:01:58.290> like

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
with another unit or anything else like

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.840 
with another unit or anything else like
that<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.560> feel<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> useless<00:01:59.579> I'm

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that I feel that's kind of useless I'm

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
that I feel that's kind of useless I'm
pretty<00:02:00.390> sure<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:00.540> some<00:02:00.840> applications

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
pretty sure there's some applications

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
pretty sure there's some applications
that<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:01.799> use<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.729> sense

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that you could use with it in that sense

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
that you could use with it in that sense
but<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:04.079> outflanking<00:02:04.619> would<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.890> far

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
but I think outflanking would be far

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
but I think outflanking would be far
more<00:02:05.310> effective<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.180> case<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.259> do

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
more effective in this case and what do

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.779 
more effective in this case and what do
you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> outflank<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> space<00:02:08.520> means

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you have the outflank in the space means

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
you have the outflank in the space means
it's<00:02:09.030> probably<00:02:09.179> gonna<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.479> largely<00:02:09.869> used<00:02:10.140> in

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it's probably gonna be largely used in

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.230 
it's probably gonna be largely used in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
something that you can outflank with you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.760 
something that you can outflank with you

sit<00:02:24.890> still<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.400> basically<00:02:25.550> get<00:02:25.940> +1

causes pinning the shots do that's why

causes pinning the shots do that's why
I'm<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.900> get<00:02:32.990> here<00:02:33.110> into<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.320> minute<00:02:33.590> I

feel that the missile launcher the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.680 
feel that the missile launcher the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
cyclone missile launcher is the best

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.470 
cyclone missile launcher is the best

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
option for the storm talent gunship you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.980 
option for the storm talent gunship you
have<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.990> single<00:02:42.560> heavy<00:02:42.800> bolter<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.580> thing

that's<00:02:44.990> absolutely<00:02:45.590> terrible<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.280> my<00:02:46.370> opinion

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
launchers and if you're firing at

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.170 
launchers and if you're firing at
infantry<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.280> assault<00:03:10.520> cannon<00:03:10.850> handles

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
infantry the assault cannon handles

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.150 
infantry the assault cannon handles
infantry<00:03:11.600> pretty<00:03:11.840> well<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.770> does<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
infantry pretty well and so does the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.710 
infantry pretty well and so does the
typhoon<00:03:13.700> missile<00:03:13.970> launcher<00:03:14.180> because<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.540> can

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
typhoon missile launcher because you can

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.780 
typhoon missile launcher because you can
use<00:03:14.840> frag<00:03:15.170> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> wish<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.220> feel<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:16.670> that

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
use frag if you wish so I feel that that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.930 
use frag if you wish so I feel that that
is<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.090> only<00:03:17.620> good<00:03:18.620> option<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.310> you're<00:03:19.850> going

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
is the only good option if you're going

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.960 
is the only good option if you're going
to<00:03:20.000> upgrade<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:21.310> heavy<00:03:22.310> bolters<00:03:22.580> on<00:03:22.820> this

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
to upgrade the heavy bolters on this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.950 
to upgrade the heavy bolters on this
thing<00:03:23.150> because<00:03:23.360> that's<00:03:23.480> going<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.690> kick<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.930> up

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
thing because that's going to kick it up

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.560 
thing because that's going to kick it up
to<00:03:24.080> 155<00:03:24.680> points<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.730> last<00:03:25.910> cannon<00:03:26.240> it<00:03:26.360> kicks

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
to 155 points the last cannon it kicks

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.310 
to 155 points the last cannon it kicks
it<00:03:26.660> up<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.020> 150<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:29.030> again<00:03:29.990> with<00:03:30.230> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
it up to you like 150 and again with the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.840 
it up to you like 150 and again with the
hover<00:03:30.530> strike<00:03:30.860> you'll<00:03:31.040> get<00:03:31.160> +1<00:03:31.370> ballistic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
hover strike you'll get +1 ballistic

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.550 
hover strike you'll get +1 ballistic
skill<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.690> you're<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.290> know<00:03:33.350> you're<00:03:33.380> not

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
skill so you're you know you're not

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.290 
skill so you're you know you're not

going to scatter as much on the the frag

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.490 
going to scatter as much on the the frag
and<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.690> same<00:03:35.840> time<00:03:35.900> since<00:03:36.350> it's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
anti-infantry you can still cause

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.220 
anti-infantry you can still cause

pinning better that way rather than

supersonic the ship can move flat out at

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.130 
supersonic the ship can move flat out at
36<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:46.580> have<00:03:47.240> nothing<00:03:47.390> bad<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.660> say<00:03:47.780> about<00:03:47.900> that

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
36 I have nothing bad to say about that

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.010 
36 I have nothing bad to say about that
it's<00:03:48.650> not<00:03:49.130> really<00:03:49.490> special<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.120> me<00:03:50.270> other<00:03:50.960> than

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
it's not really special to me other than

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.930 
it's not really special to me other than
the<00:03:51.140> fact<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.560> mean<00:03:51.770> how<00:03:52.280> opportunity

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
the fact that I mean how opportunity

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.220 
the fact that I mean how opportunity
we're<00:03:53.060> going<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.240> be<00:03:53.300> moving<00:03:53.420> 36<00:03:54.020> inches

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
we're going to be moving 36 inches

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.420 
we're going to be moving 36 inches
across<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.680> table<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.100> what<00:03:55.280> are<00:03:55.340> you

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
across the table and what are you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.650 
across the table and what are you
actually<00:03:55.520> going<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.880> be<00:03:55.910> needing<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.330> do<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
actually going to be needing to do that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.580 
actually going to be needing to do that
for<00:03:58.450> 24<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.480> my<00:03:59.630> opinion<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.020> works<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.290> fine

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
for 24 in my opinion it works just fine

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.470 
for 24 in my opinion it works just fine
supersonic<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> bonus<00:04:01.700> sure<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.180> is<00:04:02.270> because

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
supersonic is a bonus sure it is because

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.700 
supersonic is a bonus sure it is because
you<00:04:02.570> have<00:04:02.600> more<00:04:02.810> options<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.290> be<00:04:03.380> able<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.620> move

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
you have more options to be able to move

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.770 
you have more options to be able to move
further<00:04:04.010> not<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.970> big<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.270> deal<00:04:05.360> with<00:04:05.540> you

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.710 

again<00:04:09.070> overall<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.580> ship<00:04:10.820> is<00:04:11.000> not<00:04:11.150> bad<00:04:11.450> I

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
again overall the ship is not bad I

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.290 
again overall the ship is not bad I
think<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.410> problem<00:04:12.800> is<00:04:12.890> fighting<00:04:13.280> synergy<00:04:13.790> so

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
think the problem is fighting synergy so

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.160 
think the problem is fighting synergy so
that<00:04:14.480> when<00:04:14.959> you're<00:04:15.080> firing<00:04:16.720> say<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.840> assault

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
that when you're firing say the assault

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.330 
that when you're firing say the assault
cannon<00:04:18.440> at<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.590> tank<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:18.950> don't<00:04:19.100> just<00:04:19.220> have

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
cannon at a tank you don't just have

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.770 
cannon at a tank you don't just have
auto<00:04:19.549> cannons<00:04:19.940> are<00:04:20.030> not<00:04:20.150> bad<00:04:20.390> but<00:04:20.600> if<00:04:20.660> you're

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
auto cannons are not bad but if you're

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.120 
auto cannons are not bad but if you're
firing<00:04:20.989> at<00:04:21.260> licorice<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.739> you're<00:04:21.830> going<00:04:21.979> up

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
firing at licorice that you're going up

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.440 
firing at licorice that you're going up
against<00:04:22.400> necrons<00:04:22.820> or<00:04:23.000> something<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.360> they

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
against necrons or something and they

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.150 
against necrons or something and they
have<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.840> quantum<00:04:24.229> shielding

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
have the quantum shielding

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.360 
have the quantum shielding
penetrate<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.820> with<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:27.380> sky<00:04:28.040> hat<00:04:28.220> and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
penetrate that with the the sky hat and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.830 
penetrate that with the the sky hat and
missile<00:04:28.640> launcher<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.060> typhoon<00:04:29.510> missile

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
missile launcher the typhoon missile

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.330 
missile launcher the typhoon missile
launcher<00:04:30.140> however<00:04:30.470> if<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.710> roll<00:04:30.890> six<00:04:31.190> you've

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
launcher however if you roll six you've

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.430 
launcher however if you roll six you've
got<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> penetrating<00:04:32.060> hit<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.020> that's<00:04:33.200> my

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
got a penetrating hit so that's my

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.290 
got a penetrating hit so that's my
complaint<00:04:33.920> right<00:04:34.070> there<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.970> that's<00:04:35.030> why<00:04:35.270> I

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
complaint right there and that's why I

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.520 
complaint right there and that's why I
figure<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.660> typhoon<00:04:36.020> missile<00:04:36.290> launcher<00:04:36.500> has

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
figure the typhoon missile launcher has

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.100 
figure the typhoon missile launcher has
the<00:04:36.860> best<00:04:37.070> synergy<00:04:37.520> for<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.850> I<00:04:38.000> would<00:04:38.540> pretty

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the best synergy for it I would pretty

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.630 
the best synergy for it I would pretty
much<00:04:39.200> never<00:04:39.560> start<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:39.980> on<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.220> table<00:04:40.370> i

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
much never start this on the table i

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.710 
much never start this on the table i
think<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:40.910> assault<00:04:41.150> cannon<00:04:41.420> is<00:04:41.480> going<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.660> be

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
think the assault cannon is going to be

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.930 
think the assault cannon is going to be
firing<00:04:41.960> too<00:04:42.680> short<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.310> distance<00:04:43.700> or<00:04:43.820> it's

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
firing too short of a distance or it's

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.100 
firing too short of a distance or it's
going<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> be<00:04:44.180> too<00:04:44.360> vulnerable<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.870> get

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
going to be too vulnerable to get

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.440 
going to be too vulnerable to get
basically<00:04:45.560> taken<00:04:45.980> out<00:04:46.100> first<00:04:46.340> turn<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.820> think

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
basically taken out first turn I think

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.940 
basically taken out first turn I think
outflanking<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:48.380> best<00:04:48.620> thing<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:48.920> you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
outflanking is the best thing that you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.150 
outflanking is the best thing that you
can<00:04:49.130> do<00:04:49.280> with<00:04:49.430> this<00:04:49.550> ship<00:04:50.020> overall<00:04:51.020> it's<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:52.130> a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
can do with this ship overall it's not a

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.280 
can do with this ship overall it's not a
bad<00:04:52.490> fast<00:04:52.730> attack<00:04:53.090> choice<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.050> space

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
bad fast attack choice for the space

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.660 
bad fast attack choice for the space
marines<00:04:54.590> it's<00:04:54.890> cool<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.340> have<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.490> new

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
marines it's cool that we have a new

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.310 
marines it's cool that we have a new
unit<00:04:56.000> we<00:04:56.090> have<00:04:56.240> new<00:04:56.450> combos<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:56.870> we<00:04:57.050> can<00:04:57.170> come

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
unit we have new combos that we can come

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.370 
unit we have new combos that we can come
up<00:04:57.350> with<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.830> think<00:04:58.400> six<00:04:58.700> addition<00:04:59.120> might<00:04:59.380> show

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
up with I think six addition might show

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.090 
up with I think six addition might show
this<00:05:00.560> thing<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.830> little<00:05:01.040> bit<00:05:01.190> more<00:05:02.620> love<00:05:03.620> if<00:05:03.920> you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
this thing a little bit more love if you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.880 
this thing a little bit more love if you
will<00:05:04.450> other<00:05:05.450> than<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.780> at<00:05:06.110> this<00:05:06.530> point<00:05:06.770> in

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
will other than that at this point in

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.530 
will other than that at this point in
time<00:05:07.130> I<00:05:07.430> don't<00:05:08.030> think<00:05:08.150> I'm<00:05:08.210> gonna<00:05:08.270> be<00:05:08.420> getting

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
time I don't think I'm gonna be getting

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.450 
time I don't think I'm gonna be getting
a<00:05:08.720> storm<00:05:08.960> Talon<00:05:09.320> gunship<00:05:09.800> any<00:05:09.950> time<00:05:10.220> soon

a storm Talon gunship any time soon

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.900 
a storm Talon gunship any time soon
mainly<00:05:10.940> because<00:05:10.970> I'm<00:05:11.270> also<00:05:11.450> poor<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:13.310> that'll

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
mainly because I'm also poor so that'll

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.630 
mainly because I'm also poor so that'll
be<00:05:14.030> my<00:05:14.210> end<00:05:14.450> review<00:05:14.840> about<00:05:15.200> my<00:05:15.520> opinions<00:05:16.520> on

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
be my end review about my opinions on

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.400 
be my end review about my opinions on
this<00:05:16.760> running<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.300> storm<00:05:17.540> Talon<00:05:17.870> gunship<00:05:18.260> by

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
this running the storm Talon gunship by

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.430 
this running the storm Talon gunship by
itself<00:05:18.770> with<00:05:19.610> no<00:05:19.850> upgrades<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.600> just<00:05:21.200> flying

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
itself with no upgrades and just flying

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.960 
itself with no upgrades and just flying
up<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.710> table<00:05:22.010> i<00:05:22.070> think<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> bad<00:05:22.550> idea<00:05:22.610> i

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
up the table i think is a bad idea i

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.290 
up the table i think is a bad idea i
think<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.300> have<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.750> would<00:05:24.080> rather<00:05:24.200> spend<00:05:24.590> and

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
think you have I would rather spend and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.450 
think you have I would rather spend and
get<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.330> set<00:05:26.660> of<00:05:26.690> assault<00:05:27.020> squad<00:05:27.320> with<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.800> power

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
get a set of assault squad with a power

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.730 
get a set of assault squad with a power
fist<00:05:28.760> for<00:05:28.940> 125<00:05:29.600> points<00:05:29.810> flying<00:05:30.230> up<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.440> table

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
fist for 125 points flying up the table

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.590 
fist for 125 points flying up the table
and<00:05:30.860> then<00:05:31.220> those<00:05:31.400> spend<00:05:31.670> 130<00:05:32.120> points<00:05:32.270> on<00:05:32.480> this

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
and then those spend 130 points on this

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.230 
and then those spend 130 points on this
ship<00:05:32.810> my<00:05:33.200> opinion<00:05:33.680> but<00:05:34.460> that'll<00:05:34.970> end<00:05:35.120> this

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
ship my opinion but that'll end this

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.870 
ship my opinion but that'll end this

review here guys if you guys know some
combos<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.510> like<00:05:38.780> I<00:05:39.020> can<00:05:39.590> only<00:05:39.770> see<00:05:40.100> this

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
combos that you like I can only see this

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.290 
combos that you like I can only see this
being<00:05:40.400> calm<00:05:40.610> boat<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:40.910> outflanking<00:05:41.540> really<00:05:42.010> I

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
being calm boat and outflanking really I

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.780 
being calm boat and outflanking really I
don't<00:05:44.300> it's<00:05:44.690> not<00:05:44.900> going<00:05:45.260> to<00:05:45.440> mow<00:05:46.010> across<00:05:46.580> the

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
don't it's not going to mow across the

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.030 
don't it's not going to mow across the
table<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.210> kill<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.630> bunch<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:48.020> things<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:48.860> does

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
table and kill a bunch of things it does

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.380 
table and kill a bunch of things it does
have<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.280> potential<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.790> do<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.270> your

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
have the potential to do that if your

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.550 
have the potential to do that if your
opponent<00:05:50.570> doesn't<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.080> just<00:05:51.169> pretty<00:05:51.410> much

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
opponent doesn't it just pretty much

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.470 
opponent doesn't it just pretty much
ignores<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.100> but<00:05:52.700> again<00:05:52.790> I<00:05:52.970> think<00:05:53.120> you're<00:05:53.390> only

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
ignores it but again I think you're only

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.610 
ignores it but again I think you're only
going<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.690> get<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:53.930> kind<00:05:54.110> of<00:05:54.140> results<00:05:54.470> if<00:05:54.560> you

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
going to get that kind of results if you

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
going to get that kind of results if you
have<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.800> typhoon<00:05:55.160> missile<00:05:55.430> launcher

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
have the typhoon missile launcher

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.860 
have the typhoon missile launcher
because<00:05:55.790> no<00:05:55.940> matter<00:05:56.060> what<00:05:56.150> you're<00:05:56.360> firing<00:05:56.600> at

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
because no matter what you're firing at

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.930 
because no matter what you're firing at
it<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.290> be<00:05:57.380> effective<00:05:57.800> at<00:05:57.919> rather<00:05:58.490> than<00:05:58.730> just

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
it can be effective at rather than just

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.280 
it can be effective at rather than just
finding<00:05:59.120> a<00:05:59.270> single<00:05:59.450> last<00:05:59.660> cannon<00:06:00.020> into<00:06:00.140> an

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
finding a single last cannon into an

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.750 
finding a single last cannon into an
infantry<00:06:00.650> squad<00:06:00.890> with<00:06:01.040> your<00:06:01.220> assault<00:06:01.430> cannon

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
infantry squad with your assault cannon

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.310 
infantry squad with your assault cannon
at<00:06:02.120> least<00:06:02.360> you<00:06:02.480> have<00:06:02.600> more<00:06:02.750> options<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.169> other

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
at least you have more options the other

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.050 
at least you have more options the other
way<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:03.950> okay<00:06:04.130> guys<00:06:04.280> that'll<00:06:04.730> be<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:04.910> end<00:06:04.940> of

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
way so okay guys that'll be the end of

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.440 
way so okay guys that'll be the end of
this<00:06:05.120> video<00:06:05.300> hope<00:06:05.780> you<00:06:05.960> enjoyed<00:06:06.290> it
