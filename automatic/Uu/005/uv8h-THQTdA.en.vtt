00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.880 

game<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.570> am<00:00:56.870> pretty<00:00:57.020> sure<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.710> game

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
game and I am pretty sure it is the game

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.860 
game and I am pretty sure it is the game
it's<00:00:58.129> not<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.399> mouse<00:00:58.579> itself<00:00:59.030> because<00:00:59.539> I<00:00:59.719> was

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
it's not the mouse itself because I was

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.350 
it's not the mouse itself because I was
playing<00:01:00.140> other<00:01:00.350> games<00:01:00.440> beforehand<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.520> was

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
playing other games beforehand I was

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.479 
playing other games beforehand I was
running<00:01:02.690> fine<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.100> straight<00:01:04.100> after<00:01:04.220> this

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
running fine and straight after this

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.430 
running fine and straight after this
happened<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.059> ran<00:01:05.300> battlefield<00:01:05.840> 3<00:01:06.140> which<00:01:06.410> is

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
happened I ran battlefield 3 which is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.950 
happened I ran battlefield 3 which is
the<00:01:06.710> same<00:01:06.920> engine<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:08.210> there<00:01:08.690> wasn't<00:01:08.810> a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the same engine and there wasn't a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
the same engine and there wasn't a
problem<00:01:09.080> there<00:01:09.500> either

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350 

so<00:01:18.610> it's<00:01:18.939> quite<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.509> everyone<00:01:20.280> shot<00:01:21.360> dead

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
so it's quite that everyone shot dead

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.109 
so it's quite that everyone shot dead
body<00:01:22.600> slides<00:01:23.409> in<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> air<00:01:23.860> for<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:24.909> bit<00:01:25.030> was

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
body slides in the air for that bit was

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.880 
body slides in the air for that bit was
pretty<00:01:25.360> cool<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.299> my<00:01:28.630> run<00:01:28.840> key<00:01:29.079> stopped

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
pretty cool and my run key stopped

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.679 
pretty cool and my run key stopped
working<00:01:30.189> -<00:01:30.340> as<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.789> can<00:01:30.850> see<00:01:30.909> here<00:01:31.299> I'll<00:01:31.479> try

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
working - as you can see here I'll try

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.899 
working - as you can see here I'll try
to<00:01:31.750> run<00:01:31.929> away

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.859 

it's<00:01:37.810> been<00:01:38.170> annoying<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:40.420> not<00:01:40.630> sure<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:42.340> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it's been annoying I'm not sure how that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.419 
it's been annoying I'm not sure how that
be<00:01:43.869> caused<00:01:44.109> by<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.409> mouse<00:01:44.729> either<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:47.020> um<00:01:47.429> it

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
be caused by the mouse either but um it

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.969 
be caused by the mouse either but um it
appears<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:48.819> just<00:01:49.270> changing<00:01:49.780> any<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.649> your

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
appears that just changing any of your

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.980 
appears that just changing any of your
key<00:01:51.459> bindings<00:01:51.880> from<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.209> default<00:01:52.539> settings

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
key bindings from the default settings

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.749 
key bindings from the default settings
seems<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.219> do<00:01:54.609> this<00:01:54.789> for<00:01:55.179> some<00:01:55.390> reason<00:01:56.759> which

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
seems to do this for some reason which

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.099 
seems to do this for some reason which
is<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> little<00:01:58.209> bit<00:01:58.299> disappointing<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.020> the

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
is a little bit disappointing in the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.770 
is a little bit disappointing in the
game<00:01:59.319> game<00:02:00.009> has<00:02:00.219> this<00:02:00.369> complete<00:02:01.149> feel<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.569> not

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
game game has this complete feel of not

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.639 
game game has this complete feel of not
being<00:02:01.990> finished

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
being finished

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.190 
being finished
like<00:02:03.369> they<00:02:03.520> rushed<00:02:03.849> it<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.539> get<00:02:04.689> it<00:02:04.810> out<00:02:04.899> before

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
like they rushed it to get it out before

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
like they rushed it to get it out before
black<00:02:05.619> ops<00:02:05.859> 2<00:02:06.039> came<00:02:06.310> out<00:02:06.429> maybe<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.890> am<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
black ops 2 came out maybe so I am I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.910 
black ops 2 came out maybe so I am I
decide<00:02:10.869> at<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.049> point<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> maybe<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.739> would

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
decide at this point that maybe I would

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.819 
decide at this point that maybe I would
like<00:02:12.040> accidentally<00:02:12.610> bound<00:02:13.030> too<00:02:14.019> many<00:02:14.230> keys<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
like accidentally bound too many keys to

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.619 
like accidentally bound too many keys to
the<00:02:14.950> same<00:02:15.190> thing<00:02:15.519> all<00:02:15.910> too<00:02:16.180> many<00:02:16.269> mouse

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
the same thing all too many mouse

functions to the same mouse button or
something<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.590> reset

that<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.780> there's<00:02:38.109> no<00:02:38.290> key<00:02:38.530> bound<00:02:38.739> for<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.010> so

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
that do there's no key bound for that so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.039 
that do there's no key bound for that so
that's<00:02:40.030> I've<00:02:40.239> got<00:02:40.390> nothing<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:40.900> it

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
that's I've got nothing to do with it

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.030 
that's I've got nothing to do with it
though<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.500> um<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:44.139> standard<00:02:44.680> set<00:02:44.889> up

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
though but um so just a standard set up

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.400 
though but um so just a standard set up
just<00:02:45.639> with<00:02:45.760> extra<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.569> extra<00:02:46.900> mouse<00:02:47.049> buttons

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
just with extra the extra mouse buttons

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.830 
just with extra the extra mouse buttons
I<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.190> then<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.450> sudden<00:02:49.599> goes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I have and then all the sudden goes

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.099 
I have and then all the sudden goes
crazy<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.319> starts<00:02:50.859> attacking<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.519> teammate

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
crazy and starts attacking my teammate

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.460 
crazy and starts attacking my teammate
and<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.790> had<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> new<00:02:55.030> problem<00:02:55.389> like<00:02:56.290> every

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
and then I had a new problem like every

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.259 
and then I had a new problem like every
time<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.709> fired<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.310> would<00:02:57.459> melee<00:02:57.790> attack<00:02:58.090> as

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
time I fired I would melee attack as

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:06.990 
time I fired I would melee attack as
well<00:03:03.569> yes<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.900> think<00:03:05.049> they<00:03:05.230> would<00:03:05.380> um<00:03:06.000> bug

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
well yes you think they would um bug

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.699 
well yes you think they would um bug
test<00:03:07.299> this<00:03:07.480> Oh<00:03:07.829> No<00:03:08.859> well<00:03:09.130> maybe<00:03:09.489> it's<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
test this Oh No well maybe it's it is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.620 
test this Oh No well maybe it's it is
entirely<00:03:12.220> possible<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.910> my<00:03:13.060> hardware<00:03:13.450> but

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
entirely possible it is my hardware but

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.360 
entirely possible it is my hardware but
as<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.870> said<00:03:14.079> it's<00:03:14.290> only<00:03:14.470> seems<00:03:14.859> to<00:03:14.919> happen<00:03:15.250> in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
as I said it's only seems to happen in

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.530 
as I said it's only seems to happen in
this<00:03:15.489> game<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:15.970> only<00:03:16.269> when<00:03:16.419> I<00:03:16.500> change<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
this game and only when I change the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.710 
this game and only when I change the
default<00:03:19.540> configuration

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.160 

it<00:03:24.170> has<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> bit<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.070> xbox<00:03:25.610> II<00:03:25.820> feel<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:27.020> this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
it has a bit of a xbox II feel to this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.280 
it has a bit of a xbox II feel to this
game<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.070> game<00:03:28.460> mechanics<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:29.290> were

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
game like the game mechanics of were

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.190 
game like the game mechanics of were
designed<00:03:30.830> for<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.400> Xbox<00:03:32.800> but<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:35.510> really<00:03:35.780> so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
designed for the Xbox but not really so

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.830 
designed for the Xbox but not really so
much<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.950> PC<00:03:42.280> that's<00:03:43.280> up<00:03:43.490> I<00:03:43.850> think<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
much for the PC that's up I think it's a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840 
much for the PC that's up I think it's a
bit<00:03:44.990> silly<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.470> game<00:03:46.190> controls<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:46.670> thought

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
bit silly in the game controls I thought

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.890 
bit silly in the game controls I thought
they<00:03:46.940> would<00:03:47.060> have<00:03:47.090> fixed<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.540> after

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
they would have fixed this after

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.410 
they would have fixed this after
battlefield<00:03:48.320> 3<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.800> when<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.250> go<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.850> assign

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
battlefield 3 but when you go to assign

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.390 
battlefield 3 but when you go to assign
a<00:03:50.450> key<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.440> something<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.130> already

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
a key to something and it's already

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.250 
a key to something and it's already
bound<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.670> something<00:03:52.880> else<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.450> just<00:03:53.480> makes<00:03:54.140> it

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
bound to something else it just makes it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.060 
bound to something else it just makes it
duplicate<00:03:55.060> entry<00:03:56.320> instead<00:03:57.320> of<00:03:57.530> automatically

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
duplicate entry instead of automatically

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.910 
duplicate entry instead of automatically
removing<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.790> other<00:03:58.940> one<00:03:59.380> like<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.500> wants<00:04:00.800> you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
removing the other one like it wants you

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.950 
removing the other one like it wants you
but<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.640> still<00:04:01.790> have<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.270> looking<00:04:02.630> for

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
but you still have to go looking for

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.860 
but you still have to go looking for
what<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.410> other<00:04:04.090> function<00:04:05.090> was<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.660> key

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
what the other function was that the key

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.610 
what the other function was that the key
you<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.560> assigned<00:04:06.920> is<00:04:07.130> found<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.730> already<00:04:08.620> a

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
you just assigned is found to already a

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.980 
you just assigned is found to already a
little<00:04:10.430> bit<00:04:10.610> silly<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.240> can't<00:04:11.450> find<00:04:11.780> it

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
little bit silly and you can't find it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.750 
little bit silly and you can't find it
and<00:04:12.170> well<00:04:12.410> up<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.860> well<00:04:13.160> down<00:04:13.430> individually

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
and well up and well down individually

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.700 
and well up and well down individually
two<00:04:14.450> different<00:04:14.780> things<00:04:14.960> which<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.470> used<00:04:15.620> to

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
two different things which I used to

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.890 
two different things which I used to
like<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.280> for<00:04:16.459> duty<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.950> different

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
like to do and for duty a different

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.840 
like to do and for duty a different
thing<00:04:20.900> for<00:04:21.080> each<00:04:21.230> worker

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.270 

it's<00:04:25.090> not
