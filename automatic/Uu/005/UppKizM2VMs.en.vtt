00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.950 

it's<00:00:09.030> hard<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.330> me<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.660> ever<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:11.750> single<00:00:12.750> out

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
it's hard for me to ever like single out

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's hard for me to ever like single out
like<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> certain<00:00:13.980> thing<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.750> an

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
like a certain thing you know about an

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
like a certain thing you know about an
album<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.440> guess<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.980> guess<00:00:17.970> maybe<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
album I guess I guess maybe just the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.840 
album I guess I guess maybe just the
package<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> whole<00:00:19.590> cuz<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> way<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
package on a whole cuz the way just the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
package on a whole cuz the way just the
artwork<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.750> music<00:00:22.260> every<00:00:24.890> sequence<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
artwork and the music every sequence of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
artwork and the music every sequence of
the<00:00:26.580> songs<00:00:28.189> when<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.750> when<00:00:30.750> we

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the songs when I actually when we

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
the songs when I actually when we
actually<00:00:31.289> print<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> physical<00:00:32.219> copies<00:00:32.640> -

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
actually print the physical copies -

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.229 
actually print the physical copies -
it's<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.780> kind<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.030> total

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's gonna be kind of like the total

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
it's gonna be kind of like the total
package<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:39.989> makes<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.250> intriguing

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
package I think makes it more intriguing

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.080 
package I think makes it more intriguing
to<00:00:42.719> find<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.469> what's<00:00:43.710> deeper<00:00:44.250> beyond<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to find out what's deeper beyond that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990 
to find out what's deeper beyond that
actual<00:00:45.629> album<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
actual album so it's like the way that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
actual album so it's like the way that
you<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> set<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.430> be

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
you would the way I set it up was to be

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.119 
you would the way I set it up was to be
open<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.620> something<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
open like that like something like a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.979 
open like that like something like a
Bible<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.780> you're
