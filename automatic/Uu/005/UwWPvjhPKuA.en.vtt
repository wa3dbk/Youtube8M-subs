00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:11.670
 Tigers who defends the 6th Omura and the 7th Ogasawara and batsman turns are not from this solution 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.510
 It was island behalf of Merton but contains 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.260
 Because batting order is still the most complete 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.260
 That's right yeah 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.370
 It is a change to be a little worried but yes 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.370
 The light contains Shibata 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.120
 And 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.649
 In this time, if it started from No. 6, the stick was touched by touching 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.649
 Sound product seems to be grandfather 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.220
 It's a big one, but if you think about it normally 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 Hey did you say the difference is by bedding that say 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.590
 But 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 If you look at the flow of this game really, yes yes this is big 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.620
 Hmm 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.269
 One point that both teams can not take easily and can not take it 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.900
 But I entered in a surprising way in the form of 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.020
 0 after the dance 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.020
 The hit was hit but it was also because there was a horse 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 I thought that I would refuse to have a parser for the result version Sansetsu Gettsu in the scene of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 It's a job again 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.270
 It's a universe 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 tatami 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 Bonds' going to go 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.610
 Mr. Potts 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.010
 One shot 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 Post 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.580
 Hmm 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.580
 Finally Tan arrived to the staff of thunder 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.770
 Snow took place acne robot is such a beginning 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.759
 It took until August 4 of this season 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.759
 Pronunciation of Ogasawara headquarters Location Tokyo Dome 1 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.440
 It is the sum of the land of the home run, but it seems that the bench has received rumors 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.490
 hey 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.490
 Because it was 100 people 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.670
 That two 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.610
 From 2 balls to Ibaraki Yes 2 goals 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.610
 If you come, you will worship the reverence and the Mac eating wave 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.710
 It occurred in the direction of the small boat 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.870
 There is one game two hits hit in with today after a long time yesterday 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.630
 It may be said that I bake Gion Tokyo video activity blur 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.460
 I think I say anything is something I do not have the other one by one starting point Yone likely child 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.340
 It is an engine of the class that you feel free to use before kicking 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:53.270
 Back of the quite a real up here until the cows place did not'm fast and I thought I just whether the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.520
 It wasn't there 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.830
 Achieved specialization in one of those May 5 towns where Iwata threw a game 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.530
 I will tell you back later 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.010
 Day anymore then Ne also I would just me 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.840
 It is Nen will did not have cabbage, etc. 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.840
 I will tie it out, but here is out 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:22.210
 The one-shot time of where in the game deployment will be one point of the following is really far from it 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.400
 Its value is not big either 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.960
 Yes also'm big for in your Granny 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.900
 That ball 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.579
 Get out of the ball from the house a 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.730
 It's getting rich because it's hit properly, and I'm sorry I stopped saving that 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.730
 is 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.050
 I think it 's good I 'm a little 6 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.020
 You feel like that 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.040
 I am very happy to see the face right now on the bench 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.569
 It looks like the city was looking 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.569
 Bright smile spread
