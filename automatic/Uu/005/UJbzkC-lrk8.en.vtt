to work out where to put all their
things<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.750> thought<00:02:46.959> I'd<00:02:47.109> do<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> quick

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
things but I thought I'd do a quick

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.300 
things but I thought I'd do a quick
update<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.310> would<00:02:49.239> really<00:02:49.480> recommend<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
update I would really recommend the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.000 
update I would really recommend the
litter<00:02:51.519> trays<00:02:52.079> especially<00:02:53.079> for<00:02:53.260> younger<00:02:53.440> pigs

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
litter trays especially for younger pigs

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.370 
litter trays especially for younger pigs
because<00:02:54.489> mine<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.880> jump<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.329> no<00:02:55.600> problem<00:02:56.079> but

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
because mine can jump in no problem but

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.949 
because mine can jump in no problem but
I<00:02:56.620> think<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.609> Snoopy<00:02:58.060> when<00:02:58.269> he<00:02:58.420> stood<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.780> it

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
I think with Snoopy when he stood on it

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.090 
I think with Snoopy when he stood on it
it<00:02:59.049> was<00:02:59.170> tipping<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.739> bit

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
it was tipping up a bit

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.990 
it was tipping up a bit
so<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.700> didn't<00:03:00.940> want<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.180> get

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.670 

they<00:03:08.600> seem<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.990> really<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.650> anyway<00:03:13.360> like

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
they seem to really like it anyway like

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:27.480 
they seem to really like it anyway like
I<00:03:21.280> think<00:03:22.280> that's<00:03:22.460> what<00:03:22.610> thumbs<00:03:22.790> up<00:03:22.970> from<00:03:23.120> gizmo

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490
