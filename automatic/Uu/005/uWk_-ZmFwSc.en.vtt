00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
money in that regard so I think he's

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.540 
money in that regard so I think he's
done<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.020> wonderful<00:02:44.290> job<00:02:44.500> he<00:02:44.890> continues<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.370> do

taken<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.709> draft<00:03:21.010> when<00:03:21.190> he<00:03:21.280> decides<00:03:21.580> to
