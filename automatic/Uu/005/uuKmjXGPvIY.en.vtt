00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 short hello everyone talk machine 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.099
 barracuda all I want to tell you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.920
 behind the eyes 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:20.619
 plan on a frozen lake is worn 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.509
 the plane is now audio to Tyumen itself well 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.109
 okay this little 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:35.079
 the topic is shorter so the barracuda jets and that 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:37.450
 this is now going to show you what it means 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.160
 there will be a talk of size because here 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.620
 these nozzles I replaced yesterday 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 these jets replaced about a month ago 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.449
 back between 10 thousand failed 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.250
 kilometers 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:55.829
 let's start began to fail these then these these 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.829
 injectors, they have been already five 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.619
 warranty did not give somewhere a stop. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:19.689
 it turned out exactly 85 tariff 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.780
 thousand kilometers I have gone on what on 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.200
 what principle will talk on the street 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 now a little windy so search 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.229
 talk about it on the street I will not 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.149
 well, the wind will blow I will say this 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.820
 barracuda jets are much better than us 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.530
 simple jets even wanted because 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.560
 85. the loss 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.890
 not so little in principle if so to count 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.500
 then in the past opposite nozzles i 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 drove started 40 thousand kilometers to me 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.210
 I had to change the ring after the replacement 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.430
 rings and drove another 20 thousand kilometers 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.399
 and twenty meters. had to 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.869
 change the rings but then after 13 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.509
 thousand kilometers had to be changed and 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.280
 rings to do it did not so decided 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.990
 that it will be less and less and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.700
 less and therefore decided to buy a barracuda 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.510
 nozzle barracuda difference 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.390
 between simple nozzles is that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.000
 there mile principle in milliseconds allen 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 much faster opens much more often 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.620
 and sits on more powerful machines my 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.439
 nozzles can be put on the machine 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.870
 power up to 300 horsepower even to 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.129
 350 they will feel at it 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 well means 85 thousand kilometers 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.010
 rode in any mode I did not turn off 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.799
 nozzles during accelerations did not turn off 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.129
 jets during races you are healthy then 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.500
 I have a TV series only on gas say that 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.780
 if you turn off the injectors the acceleration time 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.120
 that they happen a lot more and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.859
 most likely they were going through these 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.269
 100 thousand kilometers I did not even know 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.129
 contract amort 150 thousand kilometers 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.220
 the barracuda jets themselves cost me on 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:07.290
 every head rests with work 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.650
 60 euros that is 60 euros I am for 60 euros 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.079
 corpse and three jets in general the whole 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.970
 change everything will turn out 120 euros 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.650
 month work on the principle is not so 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 great price I think even very good 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.959
 if you change the rings on simple injectors 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.079
 it costs 40 watts 40 la sposa in price 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.150
 something approximately 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.730
 will be obtained in the region of 60 euros for 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.410
 one replacement rings believe me this 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.590
 get much more expensive and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.760
 and the difference between the nozzle barracuda 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.120
 simple injectors still that machine 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.919
 tax does not work softer no I will not say that 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.590
 she became much more economical there or 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:49.199
 I read from leaflets and on swords end up zero 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.199
 three liters per 100 kilometers not 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.000
 significant difference in the nozzle principle 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.819
 barracuda makes sense to draw and go 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.099
 save money on investment car I 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.079
 I think, but if you know that you don’t 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.760
 more than forty thousand kilometers for all 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.739
 time how much will you have this car then 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.409
 principle simple jets also need 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.319
 make simple nozzles different 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.690
 nozzle barracuda so that they calculated 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.389
 on power 200 horsepower principle 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.120
 that for my machine is enough and 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.799
 no longer need but honestly 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.349
 there is a difference even on my car 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.699
 between simple nozzles and nozzles 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:28.499
 bureau code 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:32.139
 in general, say nothing more probably 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:34.439
 I will only say such a thing that for the term 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.389
 use barracuda nozzles they don't 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:40.419
 require no personal care other than 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.650
 full replacement come kilometers pro 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.080
 which I told you basically everything 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.939
 simple jets you will change these 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.310
 rings not disposable 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:55.060
 every time there is a lifetime 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.710
 approach to replacing rings she will be stupid 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.050
 I don’t know how to boot, but here come the fig 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.389
 figures it will not be your pleasure 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.639
 deliver that is simple leaves 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.889
 nozzles changed rings for 40 thousand 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.020
 kilometers in terms of saving order 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.969
 to save money you probably 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.089
 this will be done at the first replacement 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.529
 while 30000 as the other ten 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.409
 thousand kilometers principle on them 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:23.310
 almost jerked the car was stupid 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.810
 but the flow was more or less 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.389
 kind of like all i wanted to tell you 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.389
 don't wish good luck long encounters on the grass and 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.210
 Thanks for watching my video 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.990
 Like it there is a possibility but in 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.949
 principle if you liked of course 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.949
 thank you all good luck 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.370
 running at the moment my typewriter 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.780
 480 thousand eight hundred thirty kilometers 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.780
 good luck to you all
