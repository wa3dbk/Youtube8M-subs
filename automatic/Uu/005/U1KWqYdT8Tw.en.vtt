00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.610
 Meladze fruits and dried fruits but still 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.170
 there is a healthy pastry which 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.590

 Fat free sugar and flour 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 it seems impossible and we did it 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.190
 It is very important to cook healthy pastries with 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.610

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.290

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.050

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.910
 temperature for example and dried apricots 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.260

 half a day when i am given more actively 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.019
 which means less chance to get better 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.409
 but certainly there are days when after which 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.569
 it will become clear after dinner it is quite 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.540
