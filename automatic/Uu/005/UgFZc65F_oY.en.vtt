00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
rotating the barrel adjuster clockwise

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.140 
rotating the barrel adjuster clockwise
moves<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> right<00:01:27.570> yellow<00:01:27.869> bar<00:01:28.140> rearward

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
moves the right yellow bar rearward

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.620 
moves the right yellow bar rearward
rotating<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> barrel<00:01:30.540> adjuster

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
rotating the barrel adjuster

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
rotating the barrel adjuster
counterclockwise<00:01:31.590> who's<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.759> yellow

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
counterclockwise who's the right yellow

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.990 
counterclockwise who's the right yellow
bar<00:01:33.299> forward<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:35.009> case<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.790> right

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
bar forward in this case the right

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.359 
bar forward in this case the right
yellow<00:01:36.299> bar<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.869> behind<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.619> left<00:01:37.799> yellow<00:01:38.070> bar

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
yellow bar is behind the left yellow bar

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
yellow bar is behind the left yellow bar
so<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> move<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.049> yellow<00:01:40.290> bar

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so we need to move the right yellow bar

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.850 
so we need to move the right yellow bar
forward<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.540> rotate<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> barrel

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
