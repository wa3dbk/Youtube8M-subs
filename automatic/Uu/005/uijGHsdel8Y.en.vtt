the cell to either die or adapt to the
new<00:00:43.390> situation<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.380> can<00:00:44.440> better<00:00:44.740> handle

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
new situation so I can better handle

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.430 
new situation so I can better handle
what's<00:00:45.430> going<00:00:45.700> on<00:00:45.880> when<00:00:46.570> there's<00:00:46.750> an<00:00:46.870> increase

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
what's going on when there's an increase

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.400 
what's going on when there's an increase
in<00:00:47.620> cell<00:00:47.920> stress<00:00:48.310> cells<00:00:48.910> can<00:00:49.239> often<00:00:49.750> meet<00:00:50.079> this

hypertrophy<00:00:54.100> or<00:00:54.130> hyperplasia<00:00:55.000> which<00:00:55.450> I'll

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
hypertrophy or hyperplasia which I'll

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.050

talk<00:00:55.750> about<00:00:55.810> more<00:00:56.230> in<00:00:56.290> a<00:00:56.440> second<00:00:56.829> however<00:00:57.550> if

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
talk about more in a second however if

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.690 
talk about more in a second however if

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
demand it will undergo cell injury if

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.030 
demand it will undergo cell injury if
the<00:01:04.089> cell<00:01:04.360> injury<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:04.989> reversible<00:01:05.740> you're

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the cell injury is reversible you're

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.730 
the cell injury is reversible you're
going<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.369> see<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:07.210> hallmark<00:01:07.689> of<00:01:07.869> cellular

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
going to see the hallmark of cellular

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.489
