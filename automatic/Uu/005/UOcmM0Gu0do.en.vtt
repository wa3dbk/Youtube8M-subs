here is a Rob Thomas spirograph Damascus
hopefully<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.730> lights<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.150> too<00:02:23.300> bright<00:02:23.540> so

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569

you can see the awesome patterning on
the<00:02:28.459> Damascus<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> chisel<00:02:33.260> grind<00:02:34.840> but

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the Damascus this is a chisel grind but

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.910 
the Damascus this is a chisel grind but
it's<00:02:35.959> kind<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.170> cool<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:36.410> now<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.769> can

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
it's kind of cool because now you can

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.320 
it's kind of cool because now you can
see<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> flat<00:02:37.549> over<00:02:37.910> here

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
see on the flat over here

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.610 
see on the flat over here
that<00:02:38.870> intricate<00:02:39.760> pattern<00:02:41.080> under<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> mask<00:02:42.410> is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that intricate pattern under the mask is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.339 
that intricate pattern under the mask is
pretty<00:02:43.370> sweet<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.790> thick<00:02:44.180> stock<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:46.180> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
pretty sweet it is thick stock of this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.960 
pretty sweet it is thick stock of this
Damascus<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.989> now<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.519> handles

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
Damascus it is now now the the handles

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.699 
Damascus it is now now the the handles
are<00:02:53.890> silicon<00:02:54.890> bronze<00:02:55.810> texture<00:02:56.810> tech<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.200> it's

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
are silicon bronze texture tech and it's

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.699 
are silicon bronze texture tech and it's
got<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.329> Ghia<00:02:59.329> pattern<00:02:59.750> on<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.709> I

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
got this Ghia pattern on it and I

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.530 
got this Ghia pattern on it and I
believe<00:03:04.069> that's<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.640> makes<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.120> knife<00:03:05.299> it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
believe that's what makes the knife it's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.150 
believe that's what makes the knife it's
a<00:03:05.599> small<00:03:05.840> knife<00:03:06.019> but<00:03:06.380> that's<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.680> weighs<00:03:06.950> it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
a small knife but that's what weighs it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.120 
a small knife but that's what weighs it
down<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.790> believe<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.560> texture<00:03:09.560> this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
down more I believe this texture this

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.910 
down more I believe this texture this
texture<00:03:10.459> tech<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:11.030> very<00:03:11.420> heavy<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.440> from

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
texture tech is very heavy and and from

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.039 
texture tech is very heavy and and from
what<00:03:13.130> Matt<00:03:13.430> has<00:03:13.670> said<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.480> his<00:03:14.599> videos<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
what Matt has said on his videos and

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.490 
what Matt has said on his videos and
from<00:03:15.590> his<00:03:16.540> messaging<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.660> me<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.170> very

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
from his messaging to me it's very

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.110 
from his messaging to me it's very
difficult<00:03:18.980> well<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.430> should<00:03:19.700> say<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:19.940> very

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
difficult well I should say it's very

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.000 
difficult well I should say it's very
difficult<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.600> work<00:03:20.720> with<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.319> stuff<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.769> very

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
difficult to work with the stuff is very

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.479 
difficult to work with the stuff is very
soft<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.519> heavy<00:03:22.700> but<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.180> soft<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.889> um<00:03:24.889> like

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
soft it's heavy but it's soft so um like

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.539 
soft it's heavy but it's soft so um like
you<00:03:25.609> can<00:03:25.760> see<00:03:25.910> here<00:03:26.269> when<00:03:26.480> he<00:03:27.130> drilled<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
you can see here when he drilled in the

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.809 
you can see here when he drilled in the
screws<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.420> uh<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.889> material<00:03:31.400> kind<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.700> like

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
screws that uh the material kind of like

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.660 
screws that uh the material kind of like
splat<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.329> out<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:34.010> might<00:03:34.220> even<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.639> some

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
splat it out and you might even see some

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
splat it out and you might even see some
scuff<00:03:35.450> marks<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.139> from<00:03:36.410> carry<00:03:37.540> right<00:03:38.540> I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
scuff marks on it from carry right I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.890 
scuff marks on it from carry right I
left<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.079> there<00:03:39.139> on<00:03:39.440> purpose

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
left that there on purpose

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.030 
left that there on purpose
you<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.049> just<00:03:42.230> see<00:03:42.380> how<00:03:42.470> soft<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.010> material

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
you can just see how soft the material

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.110 
you can just see how soft the material
is<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.870> very<00:03:45.319> difficult<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.829> work<00:03:45.950> with<00:03:46.120> very

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
is so very difficult to work with very

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.990 
is so very difficult to work with very
beautiful<00:03:47.329> but<00:03:47.780> very<00:03:47.810> difficult<00:03:48.410> actually

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
beautiful but very difficult actually

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.460 
beautiful but very difficult actually
