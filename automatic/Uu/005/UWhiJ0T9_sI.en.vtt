hey guys thought I would just take a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.430 
hey guys thought I would just take a
minute<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.400> talk<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.389> little<00:00:09.690> bit<00:00:09.870> about<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
minute and talk a little bit about the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.790 
minute and talk a little bit about the
use<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.910> pouring<00:00:11.910> foam<00:00:12.559> in<00:00:13.940> aluminum<00:00:14.940> boats

sitting in my 1980 scene imp SS 165 and
I<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> deck<00:00:24.390> tore<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.410> see

I have the deck tore off and you can see
behind<00:00:25.740> me<00:00:25.980> I've<00:00:26.939> done<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.599> digging<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
behind me I've done some digging and and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.510 
behind me I've done some digging and and
started<00:00:29.460> tearing<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.179> pouring<00:00:30.599> foam<00:00:31.520> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
started tearing out the pouring foam and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.280 
started tearing out the pouring foam and
I<00:00:33.120> wanted<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> show<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.070> seeing<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
I wanted to show you what I'm seeing and

I wanted to show you what I'm seeing and
hopefully<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> make<00:00:38.280> an<00:00:38.430> educated

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
hopefully you can make an educated

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.470 
hopefully you can make an educated
decision<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.770> use<00:00:40.980> for

decision about what you want to use for

flotation<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.800> boat<00:00:44.210> now<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> couple

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
flotation in your boat now a couple

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.290 
flotation in your boat now a couple
things<00:00:45.690> I'll<00:00:45.930> say<00:00:46.340> real<00:00:47.340> quick<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.730> porn

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
things I'll say real quick about porn

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
things I'll say real quick about porn
foam<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> outset<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.370> think<00:00:50.640> it's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
foam right at the outset as I think it's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
foam right at the outset as I think it's
I<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.960> probably<00:00:52.110> certainly<00:00:52.739> has<00:00:53.219> its

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
I think it probably certainly has its

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.319 
I think it probably certainly has its
place<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.379> fiberglass<00:00:55.379> boats<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:57.030> due<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
place in fiberglass boats just due to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
place in fiberglass boats just due to
the<00:00:57.539> construction<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> put<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the construction when you put a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
the construction when you put a
fiberglass<00:00:59.430> boat<00:00:59.730> together<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.920> building

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
fiberglass boat together you're building

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
fiberglass boat together you're building
bulkheads<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> compartments<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> are

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
bulkheads and compartments that are

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.890 
bulkheads and compartments that are
completely<00:01:04.049> sealed<00:01:04.290> off<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.979> sides<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
completely sealed off on all sides and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.039 
completely sealed off on all sides and
so<00:01:07.460> therefore<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:09.450> no<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so therefore there's there's no way the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.340 
so therefore there's there's no way the
water<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.600> foam<00:01:12.840> it's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
water can actually get to the foam it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160 
water can actually get to the foam it's
completely<00:01:13.890> seal<00:01:14.130> off<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.020> not

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
completely seal off and so it's not

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.969 
completely seal off and so it's not
going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> saturate<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:19.560> about<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going to saturate that's about all I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
going to saturate that's about all I
know<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.310> fiberglass<00:01:20.880> boats<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.990> use

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
know about fiberglass boats and the use

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
know about fiberglass boats and the use
of<00:01:22.140> foam<00:01:24.439> there<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> couple<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> huge

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
of foam there are a couple of huge

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
of foam there are a couple of huge
advantages<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:28.170> using<00:01:28.350> pouring<00:01:28.920> foam<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
advantages to using pouring foam in

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.710 
advantages to using pouring foam in
aluminum<00:01:30.600> boats<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:32.720> sound

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
aluminum boats and that is sound

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.819 
aluminum boats and that is sound
deadening<00:01:34.520> as<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.939> Lumina<00:01:36.750> boats<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
deadening as you know Lumina boats in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.859 
deadening as you know Lumina boats in
chop<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:40.100> rough<00:01:41.100> experience

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
chop is just kind of a rough experience

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.649 
chop is just kind of a rough experience
and<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.439> poor<00:01:43.710> foam<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.670> dead<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and that poor foam can really dead in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
and that poor foam can really dead in
the<00:01:45.780> sound<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:47.460> an<00:01:47.670> aluminum<00:01:48.119> boat<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.770> other

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the sound in an aluminum boat the other

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
the sound in an aluminum boat the other
thing<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.090> can't<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.750> give

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thing is is it can it can't really give

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.740 
thing is is it can it can't really give
you<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.350> structure<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.000> boat<00:01:54.270> itself

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you a good structure in the boat itself

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380 
you a good structure in the boat itself
because<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> locks<00:01:55.979> everything<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.939> good

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because it locks everything in good

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.319 
because it locks everything in good
support<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> deck<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.119> those<00:02:00.299> are

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
support for the deck and so those are

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.170 
support for the deck and so those are
those<00:02:00.750> are<00:02:00.930> two<00:02:01.140> huge<00:02:01.280> advantages<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
those are two huge advantages for the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209 
those are two huge advantages for the
use<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> pouring<00:02:03.780> foam<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.380> aluminum<00:02:04.860> boat

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
use of pouring foam in an aluminum boat

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.380 
use of pouring foam in an aluminum boat
now<00:02:05.969> unfortunately<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.990> opinion<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
now unfortunately my opinion is that the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.809 
now unfortunately my opinion is that the
disadvantages

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
disadvantages

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.039 
disadvantages
in<00:02:09.879> foam<00:02:11.219> far<00:02:12.219> outweigh<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.030> advantages<00:02:13.150> and

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
in foam far outweigh the advantages and

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.369 
in foam far outweigh the advantages and
I<00:02:14.769> can<00:02:14.950> show<00:02:15.249> you<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.670> those<00:02:15.849> are<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
I can show you what those are in this

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.160 
I can show you what those are in this
particular<00:02:17.739> boat<00:02:18.209> let's<00:02:19.209> take<00:02:19.389> a<00:02:19.420> look<00:02:21.359> so<00:02:22.359> you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
particular boat let's take a look so you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.910 
particular boat let's take a look so you
can<00:02:23.349> see<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:25.359> I've<00:02:25.989> started<00:02:26.290> tearing<00:02:26.709> this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
can see that I've started tearing this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.929 
can see that I've started tearing this
stuff<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.870> now<00:02:28.870> most<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.799> this<00:02:29.980> stuff<00:02:30.340> kind<00:02:30.849> of

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
stuff out now most of this stuff kind of

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.569 
stuff out now most of this stuff kind of
this<00:02:31.060> big<00:02:31.329> pile<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> top<00:02:32.579> came

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
this big pile right here on the top came

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
down here you can see this is what this

down here you can see this is what this
what<00:03:41.409> the<00:03:41.590> deck<00:03:41.949> looked<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.909> underneath

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
what the deck looked like underneath

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.699 
what the deck looked like underneath
this<00:03:45.040> pouring<00:03:45.459> foam<00:03:45.759> look<00:03:46.239> at<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.479> I<00:03:46.720> mean

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
this pouring foam look at that I mean

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.089 
this pouring foam look at that I mean
that<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.069> just<00:03:48.729> horrendous<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.919> main

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
that is just horrendous in the main

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.759 
that is just horrendous in the main
problem<00:03:51.609> there<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.939> if<00:03:52.269> any<00:03:52.810> water<00:03:53.109> gets<00:03:53.560> in

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
problem there is if any water gets in

problem there is if any water gets in
here<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.819> water<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.449> just<00:03:55.479> going<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.900> sit<00:03:56.229> in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
here the water is just going to sit in

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.789 
here the water is just going to sit in
between<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:57.099> foam<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.729> was<00:03:57.879> up<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.150> top<00:03:58.799> and

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
between that foam that was up on top and

between that foam that was up on top and
that<00:03:59.829> deck<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.669> mean<00:04:01.000> this<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.389> this<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:02.949> is

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
that deck I mean this is this is this is

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.580 
that deck I mean this is this is this is
like<00:04:03.280> wet<00:04:03.609> mulch<00:04:03.939> I<00:04:04.269> mean<00:04:04.689> there<00:04:05.109> just<00:04:05.439> is

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
gets trapped in between those two layers

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.119 
gets trapped in between those two layers
and<00:04:10.449> there<00:04:10.599> is<00:04:10.719> nowhere<00:04:11.259> to<00:04:11.409> go<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.949> has

absolutely nowhere to go I mean look at
that<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.560> horrendous<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:19.000> foam

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
that that is just horrendous the foam

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.659 
that that is just horrendous the foam
block<00:04:19.690> was<00:04:19.959> was<00:04:20.590> basically<00:04:20.829> sitting<00:04:21.279> on<00:04:21.459> top

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
block was was basically sitting on top

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.840 
block was was basically sitting on top
of<00:04:21.849> this<00:04:21.969> up<00:04:22.630> here

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
of this up here

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and you can see back here on my transom

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.050 
and you can see back here on my transom
the<00:04:27.990> phone<00:04:28.290> was<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.950> basically<00:04:29.340> back<00:04:29.730> right

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
the phone was was basically back right

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.380 
the phone was was basically back right
up<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.510> so<00:04:30.750> any<00:04:30.990> moisture<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.860> there<00:04:32.390> it

up to this so any moisture in there it
just<00:04:33.420> basically<00:04:34.050> got<00:04:34.440> trapped<00:04:35.010> in<00:04:35.370> between

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
just basically got trapped in between

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.230 
just basically got trapped in between
the<00:04:36.390> foam<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.470> transom<00:04:37.950> look<00:04:38.730> at<00:04:38.820> how<00:04:39.000> bad

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the foam in that transom look at how bad

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240 
the foam in that transom look at how bad
that<00:04:39.480> is<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.230> just<00:04:40.980> absolutely

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
that is that is just absolutely

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.510 
that is that is just absolutely
horrendous<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.500> that's<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.160> was<00:04:44.340> that

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
horrendous so that's that was that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.890 
horrendous so that's that was that
section<00:04:45.000> there<00:04:45.410> now<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:47.100> section<00:04:47.610> back<00:04:48.600> over

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
section there now the section back over

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
section there now the section back over
here<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.530> actually<00:04:50.010> dug<00:04:50.460> out<00:04:51.230> a<00:04:52.230> section<00:04:52.800> in

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
here I actually dug out a section in

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.580 
here I actually dug out a section in
between<00:04:53.010> these<00:04:53.730> ribs<00:04:54.060> here<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:55.200> can<00:04:55.380> see

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
between these ribs here and you can see

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.480 
between these ribs here and you can see
look<00:04:55.830> at<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.100> water<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.610> there<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.800> just

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
look at the water in there this is just

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.650 
look at the water in there this is just
amazing

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
amazing

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.050 
amazing
the<00:05:00.990> water<00:05:01.230> has<00:05:01.560> note<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.160> bow<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.550> sitting<00:05:02.910> up

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the water has note the bow is sitting up

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.390 
the water has note the bow is sitting up
high<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:04.140> has<00:05:04.290> positive<00:05:04.530> drainage<00:05:05.250> all

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
high and it has positive drainage all

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.640 
high and it has positive drainage all
the<00:05:05.490> way<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.850> back<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.390> can<00:05:06.570> see<00:05:06.840> this

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the way to the back but you can see this

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.090 
the way to the back but you can see this
is<00:05:07.890> this<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.630> dam<00:05:10.470> there<00:05:10.950> is

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
is this is just like a dam there is

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.490 
is this is just like a dam there is
absolutely<00:05:11.550> nowhere<00:05:12.480> for<00:05:12.960> this<00:05:13.080> water<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.530> go

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
absolutely nowhere for this water to go

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.560 
absolutely nowhere for this water to go
so<00:05:16.500> any<00:05:16.800> water<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.400> gets<00:05:17.580> into<00:05:17.970> this<00:05:18.090> boat<00:05:18.360> is

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
so any water that gets into this boat is

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.450 
so any water that gets into this boat is
going<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.780> be<00:05:18.930> completely<00:05:19.380> blocked<00:05:19.680> off<00:05:19.950> and

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
going to be completely blocked off and

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.700 
going to be completely blocked off and
the<00:05:21.120> water<00:05:21.330> is<00:05:21.450> going<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.630> enter<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.050> bilge<00:05:22.320> in

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
the water is going to enter the bilge in

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.590 
the water is going to enter the bilge in
the<00:05:22.830> sub<00:05:23.070> deck<00:05:23.310> area<00:05:23.730> in<00:05:24.950> basically<00:05:25.950> one<00:05:26.310> of

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
the sub deck area in basically one of

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.570 
the sub deck area in basically one of
several<00:05:27.600> ways<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.350> going<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.590> any<00:05:29.250> kind<00:05:29.490> of

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
several ways it's going to any kind of

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.090 
several ways it's going to any kind of
rain<00:05:29.790> or<00:05:30.090> water<00:05:30.870> sea<00:05:31.350> water<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.800> going<00:05:31.920> to<00:05:32.010> hit

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
rain or water sea water is going to hit

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.460 
rain or water sea water is going to hit
the<00:05:32.220> deck<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.730> then<00:05:33.390> run<00:05:33.630> off<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.200> then<00:05:34.440> run

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
the deck and then run off and then run

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.560 
the deck and then run off and then run
underneath<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.370> deck<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.910> it's<00:05:36.420> either

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
underneath the deck and it's either

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.600 
underneath the deck and it's either
going<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.750> come<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:37.080> top<00:05:37.350> of<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.650> foam<00:05:37.920> or

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
going to come on top of this foam or

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.710 
going to come on top of this foam or
it's<00:05:38.760> going<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:38.970> try<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.270> work<00:05:39.390> its<00:05:39.600> way

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
it's going to try and work its way

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.640 
it's going to try and work its way
underneath<00:05:40.050> this<00:05:40.410> foam<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:43.140> it<00:05:43.260> just<00:05:43.470> has

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
underneath this foam and and it just has

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.920 
underneath this foam and and it just has
nowhere<00:05:43.950> to<00:05:44.100> go<00:05:44.190> there<00:05:44.880> there<00:05:45.180> is<00:05:45.300> absolutely

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
nowhere to go there there is absolutely

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.990 
nowhere to go there there is absolutely
nowhere<00:05:46.290> for<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.860> water<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.280> go<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.460> can<00:05:47.760> and

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
nowhere for the water to go you can and

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.150 
nowhere for the water to go you can and
you<00:05:48.090> can<00:05:48.240> see<00:05:48.480> all<00:05:49.110> it's<00:05:49.440> going<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.650> happen<00:05:50.040> is

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
you can see all it's going to happen is

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.850 
you can see all it's going to happen is
it's<00:05:50.370> just<00:05:50.550> going<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.730> sit<00:05:51.060> there<00:05:51.560> forever<00:05:52.560> and

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
it's just going to sit there forever and

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.160 
it's just going to sit there forever and
ever<00:05:52.980> until<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.940> starts<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.450> saturate<00:05:54.990> into

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
ever until it starts to saturate into

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.680 
ever until it starts to saturate into
the<00:05:55.320> phone<00:05:55.560> or<00:05:56.250> evaporates<00:05:57.180> one<00:05:57.420> way<00:05:57.600> or

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
the phone or evaporates one way or

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.880 
the phone or evaporates one way or
another<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.200> can<00:05:58.350> see<00:05:58.530> here<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.830> just

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
another and you can see here I just

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.380 
another and you can see here I just
started<00:05:59.430> digging<00:05:59.550> this<00:05:59.820> out<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.360> little

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
started digging this out just a little

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.140 
started digging this out just a little
bit<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.050> can<00:06:01.170> see<00:06:01.350> here<00:06:01.910> look<00:06:02.910> at<00:06:03.030> the

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
bit and you can see here look at the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.780 
bit and you can see here look at the
water<00:06:03.390> I<00:06:03.660> mean<00:06:03.750> that's<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:04.110> tremendous<00:06:04.790> and

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
water I mean that's just tremendous and

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.820 
water I mean that's just tremendous and
you<00:06:05.880> can<00:06:06.030> see<00:06:06.240> here<00:06:06.690> when<00:06:06.870> I<00:06:06.900> don't<00:06:07.680> know<00:06:07.770> if

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
you can see here when I don't know if

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.200 
you can see here when I don't know if
the<00:06:07.890> camera<00:06:08.190> will<00:06:08.250> show<00:06:08.430> up<00:06:08.550> but<00:06:08.670> you<00:06:08.730> can<00:06:09.000> I

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
the camera will show up but you can I

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.050 
the camera will show up but you can I
can<00:06:09.780> push<00:06:10.020> my<00:06:10.410> fingers<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.980> it<00:06:11.070> just<00:06:11.580> squeezes

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
can push my fingers and it just squeezes

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.850 
can push my fingers and it just squeezes
the<00:06:12.210> water<00:06:12.710> right<00:06:13.710> out<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:13.950> it<00:06:15.350> and<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.770> I

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
the water right out of it and and I

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.310 
the water right out of it and and I
would<00:06:16.920> I<00:06:17.430> would<00:06:17.820> tend<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.120> think<00:06:18.210> that<00:06:18.540> foam

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
would I would tend to think that foam

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.420 
would I would tend to think that foam
that<00:06:19.590> is<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:20.570> saturated<00:06:21.920> would<00:06:22.920> be<00:06:23.040> entirely

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
that is that saturated would be entirely

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.120 
that is that saturated would be entirely
useless<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.420> it<00:06:25.110> really<00:06:25.470> doesn't<00:06:25.740> make<00:06:25.950> any

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
useless it it really doesn't make any

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.900 
useless it it really doesn't make any
difference<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:26.700> it<00:06:26.880> deadens<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.300> sound<00:06:28.910> or

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
difference if it deadens the sound or

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.320 
difference if it deadens the sound or
provides<00:06:30.590> some<00:06:31.590> structure<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.040> the<00:06:32.190> boat<00:06:32.370> if

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
provides some structure to the boat if

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.290 
provides some structure to the boat if
it<00:06:33.540> if<00:06:33.780> it<00:06:33.900> doesn't<00:06:34.170> displace<00:06:34.530> water<00:06:34.970> and<00:06:35.970> it

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
it if it doesn't displace water and it

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.399 
it if it doesn't displace water and it
adds<00:06:36.510> a<00:06:36.690> ton<00:06:36.990> of<00:06:37.020> weight

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
adds a ton of weight

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.299 
adds a ton of weight
to<00:06:37.499> the<00:06:37.619> boat<00:06:37.830> so<00:06:38.719> some<00:06:39.719> of<00:06:39.839> these<00:06:39.899> pieces<00:06:40.309> that

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:41.309 
to the boat so some of these pieces that

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.609 
to the boat so some of these pieces that
I<00:06:41.369> can<00:06:41.519> pull<00:06:41.729> out<00:06:41.759> of<00:06:41.939> here<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.539> mean<00:06:43.379> some<00:06:43.589> of

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:43.619 
I can pull out of here I mean some of

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.519 
I can pull out of here I mean some of
them<00:06:43.830> you<00:06:44.519> can<00:06:44.669> you<00:06:44.969> can<00:06:45.149> kind<00:06:45.449> of<00:06:45.569> squeeze

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:46.529 
them you can you can kind of squeeze

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:53.989 
them you can you can kind of squeeze
them<00:06:46.800> out<00:06:48.050> like<00:06:49.050> like<00:06:49.409> a<00:06:49.469> sponge<00:06:49.889> I<00:06:52.729> mean<00:06:53.729> that

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:53.999 
them out like like a sponge I mean that

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:59.049 
them out like like a sponge I mean that
is<00:06:55.099> that's<00:06:56.099> just<00:06:56.399> tremendous<00:06:56.789> that's<00:06:57.659> amazing

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059 
is that's just tremendous that's amazing

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
place in an aluminum boat we have to

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.449 
place in an aluminum boat we have to
have<00:07:15.119> something<00:07:15.599> some<00:07:16.259> kind<00:07:16.289> of<00:07:16.589> displacement

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:17.459 
have something some kind of displacement

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.929 
have something some kind of displacement
method<00:07:18.209> some<00:07:18.599> sort<00:07:18.899> of<00:07:19.459> material<00:07:20.459> to<00:07:20.610> put<00:07:20.759> in

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:20.939 
method some sort of material to put in

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:24.350 
method some sort of material to put in
there<00:07:21.149> that<00:07:21.419> has<00:07:21.779> to<00:07:22.019> be<00:07:22.139> able<00:07:22.229> to<00:07:22.349> drain<00:07:23.360> when

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
there that has to be able to drain when

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.869 
there that has to be able to drain when
you<00:07:24.479> when<00:07:24.839> you're<00:07:24.989> pouring<00:07:25.259> foam<00:07:25.649> and<00:07:26.069> it<00:07:26.669> gets

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 
you when you're pouring foam and it gets

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.209 
you when you're pouring foam and it gets
in<00:07:27.089> there<00:07:27.329> and<00:07:27.659> it<00:07:28.079> just<00:07:28.319> just<00:07:28.589> blocks<00:07:28.919> any

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:29.219 
in there and it just just blocks any

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:32.659 
in there and it just just blocks any
kind<00:07:29.489> of<00:07:29.610> water<00:07:29.849> flow<00:07:30.719> from<00:07:31.229> the<00:07:31.619> from<00:07:32.550> the

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
kind of water flow from the from the

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.969 
kind of water flow from the from the
hull<00:07:32.819> of<00:07:32.969> the<00:07:33.059> boat<00:07:33.089> back<00:07:34.050> to<00:07:34.079> the<00:07:34.319> bilge<00:07:34.559> and

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
hull of the boat back to the bilge and

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.540 
hull of the boat back to the bilge and
then<00:07:35.519> over<00:07:35.759> the<00:07:35.909> side<00:07:36.179> through<00:07:36.599> a<00:07:36.629> bilge<00:07:36.899> pump

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550 
then over the side through a bilge pump

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.689 
then over the side through a bilge pump
that<00:07:38.550> that<00:07:38.819> process<00:07:39.089> cannot<00:07:39.689> be<00:07:39.749> stopped<00:07:40.699> or

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 
that that process cannot be stopped or

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.389 
that that process cannot be stopped or
slowed<00:07:41.999> down<00:07:42.499> it<00:07:43.499> really<00:07:43.769> doesn't<00:07:44.099> do<00:07:44.189> any

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:44.399 
slowed down it really doesn't do any

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:47.719 
slowed down it really doesn't do any
