00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Finn and I've always always always had a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
Finn and I've always always always had a
theory<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> um<00:01:10.070> ray<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.909> solo<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
theory that um ray is a solo or a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.560 
theory that um ray is a solo or a
Skywalker<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.040> I'm<00:01:14.189> leaning<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:14.820> towards<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
Skywalker but I'm leaning more towards a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
Skywalker but I'm leaning more towards a
solo<00:01:16.369> especially<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.700> look<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.060> how

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
solo especially if you just look at how

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320 
solo especially if you just look at how
things<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:19.020> playing<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.530> um<00:01:20.280> especially<00:01:21.030> if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
things are playing out um especially if

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
things are playing out um especially if
you<00:01:21.390> look<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> Vanity<00:01:22.380> Fair<00:01:22.490> photoshoot

case she's in between who I think could

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.139

we have this comic out with sana solo
and<00:01:54.530> what<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.680> thinking<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:57.020> Rey<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and what I'm thinking is that Rey and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.889 
and what I'm thinking is that Rey and
Finn<00:01:58.500> who<00:01:59.310> both<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.939> last<00:02:00.270> names<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.780> are

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
Finn who both have last names that are

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.030 
Finn who both have last names that are
not<00:02:01.140> revealed<00:02:01.740> our<00:02:02.509> solos<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.770> think

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
not revealed our solos now I don't think

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
not revealed our solos now I don't think
that<00:02:05.189> their<00:02:05.399> biological<00:02:06.390> brother<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> sister

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that their biological brother and sister

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
that their biological brother and sister
of<00:02:07.140> course<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.759> are

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
of course but I do think they are

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.869 
of course but I do think they are
related<00:02:09.450> by<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> family<00:02:10.649> name<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.580> think

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
related by the family name and I think

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.460 
related by the family name and I think
that<00:02:12.060> saw<00:02:12.330> no<00:02:12.390> solo

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that saw no solo

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.520 
that saw no solo
could<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.740> had<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.950> son<00:02:14.280> later<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> road

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
could have had a son later down the road

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.200 
could have had a son later down the road
kept<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> name<00:02:16.860> kept<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> Han<00:02:17.610> Solo<00:02:18.000> name

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
kept the name kept the Han Solo name

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.840 
kept the name kept the Han Solo name
because<00:02:18.630> maybe<00:02:19.080> she's<00:02:19.350> psychotic<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.280> she<00:02:20.400> is

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
because maybe she's psychotic and she is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.910 
because maybe she's psychotic and she is
still<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.180> love<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.570> Han<00:02:21.750> or<00:02:21.930> whatever<00:02:22.170> we'll

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
still in love with Han or whatever we'll

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.250 
still in love with Han or whatever we'll
find<00:02:23.130> out<00:02:23.280> eventually<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.570> she<00:02:24.780> named<00:02:25.020> her

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
find out eventually and she named her

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.370 
find out eventually and she named her
son<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> Finn<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.790> thus<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.420> sinned<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
son and Finn and thus we have sinned a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.090 
son and Finn and thus we have sinned a
fin<00:02:28.980> solo<00:02:29.330> who<00:02:30.330> isn't<00:02:30.960> really<00:02:31.320> related<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.800> hon

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
fin solo who isn't really related to hon

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.830 
fin solo who isn't really related to hon
but<00:02:32.580> still<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:32.970> some<00:02:33.180> sort<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.420> sort<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
but still have some sort of sort of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.510 
but still have some sort of sort of
affiliation<00:02:34.350> at<00:02:34.680> least<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.010> his<00:02:35.130> family

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
affiliation at least with his family

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.550 
affiliation at least with his family
name<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.540> raised<00:02:36.870> solo<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
name and then we have raised solo and I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
name and then we have raised solo and I
think<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> look<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> Vanity

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
think that if you look at the Vanity

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
think that if you look at the Vanity
Fair<00:02:39.720> cover<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.470> brings<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.280> much<00:02:41.430> more

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
Fair cover it brings so much more

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850 
Fair cover it brings so much more
meaning<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:43.020> at<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.590> photo

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
meaning to it if you look at that photo

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.930 
meaning to it if you look at that photo
and<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> say<00:02:44.370> hey<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.150> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.780> Hans

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and you say hey that's kind of Hans

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.280 
and you say hey that's kind of Hans
offspring<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.360> we're<00:02:48.540> looking<00:02:48.810> at<00:02:48.990> one

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
offspring and that we're looking at one

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.670 
offspring and that we're looking at one
biological<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.580> by<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.820> know<00:02:51.680> paternal

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
biological one just by you know paternal

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760 
biological one just by you know paternal
naming<00:02:53.459> schemes<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.020> was<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.590> my

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
naming schemes but that was it that's my

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.190 
naming schemes but that was it that's my
theory<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.730> could<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.270> completely<00:02:57.450> wrong<00:02:58.020> about

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
theory I could be completely wrong about

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.440 
theory I could be completely wrong about
that<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.490> like<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.820> share<00:03:00.090> some<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.300> my
