00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.700 
the experiment I will be doing today
it's<00:00:05.350> called<00:00:06.040> potato<00:00:06.490> power<00:00:07.260> I'm<00:00:08.260> going<00:00:08.320> to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
it's called potato power I'm going to

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's called potato power I'm going to
take<00:00:08.950> these<00:00:09.250> two<00:00:09.310> potatoes<00:00:10.150> to<00:00:10.510> power<00:00:10.750> this

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
take these two potatoes to power this

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.500 
take these two potatoes to power this
one<00:00:11.530> calculator<00:00:12.280> as<00:00:12.610> you<00:00:13.180> see<00:00:13.360> this

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
one calculator as you see this

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.480 
one calculator as you see this

and 3 wires here are the step by step
directions<00:00:32.789> take<00:00:33.789> a<00:00:33.819> penny<00:00:34.210> and<00:00:34.679> poke<00:00:35.679> it<00:00:35.710> into

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
directions take a penny and poke it into

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.479 
directions take a penny and poke it into
the<00:00:37.530> potato<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.969> on<00:00:40.239> both<00:00:40.629> potatoes<00:00:41.489> then

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
the potato do that on both potatoes then

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.599 
the potato do that on both potatoes then
take<00:00:43.179> a<00:00:43.210> galvanized<00:00:43.899> nail<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:44.589> poke<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.370> into

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
take a galvanized nail and poke it into

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.900 
take a galvanized nail and poke it into
both<00:00:46.030> potatoes

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.369 

then<00:00:53.570> take<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.230> wire<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:56.079> connect<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.350> from

galvanized nail in one potato to a penny

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.999 
galvanized nail in one potato to a penny
in<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.140> other<00:01:04.239> then<00:01:05.259> flip<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.409> calculator

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
in the other then flip the calculator

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.889 
in the other then flip the calculator
over<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.080> take<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.440> wire<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.690> connect<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.869> from

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
over and take a wire and connect it from

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.539 
over and take a wire and connect it from
the<00:01:12.440> penny<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.770> battery<00:01:15.770> terminal

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
the penny on one to a battery terminal

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.930 
the penny on one to a battery terminal
in<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:17.360> calculator<00:01:18.250> do<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.789> other

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
in the calculator do that on the other

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.050 
in the calculator do that on the other
side<00:01:20.390> too

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:38.490 

when<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.049> flip<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.470> over<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.400> show<00:01:31.700> work

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.770 

what<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.130> learned<00:01:39.490> from<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.850> experiment<00:01:40.450> is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
what I learned from this experiment is

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.520 
what I learned from this experiment is
that<00:01:41.410> when<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.600> when<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.140> take<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
that when you that when you take the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.890 
that when you that when you take the
zinc<00:01:44.890> from<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.370> galvanized<00:01:45.880> nail<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:46.570> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
zinc from a galvanized nail in the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.070 
zinc from a galvanized nail in the
copper<00:01:47.410> from<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.950> penny<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.910> makes<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.450> chemical

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
copper from a penny it makes a chemical

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.230 
copper from a penny it makes a chemical
reaction<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.970> takes<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.390> chemical<00:01:53.020> reaction<00:01:53.350> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
reaction it takes a chemical reaction to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.570 
reaction it takes a chemical reaction to
make<00:01:55.240> electrons<00:01:55.960> flood<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.590> that's<00:01:57.190> how<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
make electrons flood and that's how the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:08.630 
make electrons flood and that's how the
calculator<00:01:58.390> works

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.700
