it's waltzing gearfried cuts all the way
out<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:10.410> then<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> didn't<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.490> now

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
out and then if you didn't have one now

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
out and then if you didn't have one now
just<00:01:13.200> use<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.620> throttle<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.370> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
just use the throttle to go and that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.840 
just use the throttle to go and that
eliminates<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.940> hopping<00:01:19.430> I'm<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.700> in
