00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.189
 good after having protected with 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 aluminum foil what you have to see here 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.780
 with the track connector 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.450
 the vibrator so you will not suffer 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.210
 some deterioration do not burn 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.950
 then we proceed to withdraw the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 circuit that we have proven to be 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.020
 heats in this case this circuit that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.510
 we see from here you have to reference with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.190
 what it has 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.440
 concerning the signal 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.600
 in a previous case there was also 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.150
 retired and I could solve that the 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.060
 cell phone will no longer download 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.060
 and the phone that you looked good 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.320
 in case maybe it does not hold us pointed 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.329
 something or we have signal deficiency 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.199
 then we will replace it with one of the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.199
 same phone 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.930
 from another phone 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.180
 and I am what we withdraw we are going to hope that it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.339
 let the water cool down and we'll try 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.550
 again if it overheats it would touch wait 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.020
 that will cool completely 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.720
 and to be able to do so , however, we are going to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.670
 check 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.670
 the consumption has with the source 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.360
 and so we will finish and the circuit 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.360
 digital will be the indicated 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.510
 we have already removed the first one and we look 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.240
 what 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.440
 that consumption was still following the consumption 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.980
 initial but what you remove already the second 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:57.170
 So there I saw that the short film 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:00.820
 removed to lower the consumption I had of the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.860
 almost 400 milliamps already retired 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.040
 we will make here with the source of 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 power 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.880
 let's do here 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 and there we see the normal consumption of a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.209
 blackberry 9300 of d 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.209
 0 50 milliamps 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 0.50 milliamperes 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.690
 and now while we're going to solder again 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.430
 the first one means that the first 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.070
 It was not short but like 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.070
 it warmed so close we thought it was that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.200
 it's simple to simply leave it where 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.200
 for so much 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.990
 incorporating where 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.640
 until they cool 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.610
 and we already have a phone solved already 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.140
 it does not heat up and the battery is not going 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.420
 to download at the beginning to heat the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.580
 battery services the arauca service 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.500
 professional technician in dead telephony 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.540
 remember that if you have any failure 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.530
 it's just getting the driver 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.329
 that we remove that is short and power 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.320
 solve any deficiency that 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.320
 may remain in the signal
