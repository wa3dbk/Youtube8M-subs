what's<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.189> guys<00:00:08.250> static<00:00:08.849> here<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
what's going on guys static here and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.330 
what's going on guys static here and
I've<00:00:09.990> recently<00:00:10.290> been<00:00:10.530> messing<00:00:10.830> around<00:00:10.920> with

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I've recently been messing around with

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.030 
I've recently been messing around with
the<00:00:11.580> wireless<00:00:12.090> redstone<00:00:12.710> circuit<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.980> I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the wireless redstone circuit that I

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.379 
the wireless redstone circuit that I
showed<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.309> guys<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.820> latest<00:00:15.150> video

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
showed you guys in my latest video

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.660 
showed you guys in my latest video
trying<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> come<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> couple<00:00:16.289> of

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
trying to come up with a couple of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.640 
trying to come up with a couple of
slightly<00:00:17.670> different<00:00:17.970> uses<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
slightly different uses for it and I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
slightly different uses for it and I
came<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.359> basically<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.660> idea<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
came up with basically this idea I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.939 
came up with basically this idea I
remember<00:00:23.189> seeing<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> server<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.390> while<00:00:24.570> ago

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
remember seeing on a server a while ago

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
remember seeing on a server a while ago
minigames<00:00:25.949> sort<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.760> archery

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
minigames sort of like this like archery

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
minigames sort of like this like archery
practice<00:00:27.779> where<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> goal<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> hit<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
practice where the goal is to hit the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.040 
practice where the goal is to hit the
bullseye<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.330> picture<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> middle

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
bullseye so the picture in the middle

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.590 
bullseye so the picture in the middle
and<00:00:31.279> when<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.090> picture<00:00:33.390> falls

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and when you do that the picture falls

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.500 
and when you do that the picture falls
off<00:00:33.809> hits<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> pressure<00:00:34.410> plates<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.510> lights

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
off hits the pressure plates and lights

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
off hits the pressure plates and lights
up<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.550> lamps<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> side<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:40.320> problem

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
up the the lamps on the side the problem

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.280 
up the the lamps on the side the problem
with<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.510> one<00:00:42.510> every<00:00:42.899> time<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
with this is that one every time you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
with this is that one every time you
shoot<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.739> hit<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> bullseye<00:00:44.399> you've<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
shoot and hit the bullseye you've got to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.630 
shoot and hit the bullseye you've got to
come<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.340> start<00:00:47.450> go<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> creative<00:00:49.079> mode

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
come up and start go to a creative mode

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.930 
come up and start go to a creative mode
go<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> start<00:00:50.940> replacing<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.230> painting

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
go to start replacing the the painting

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
go to start replacing the the painting
until<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.649> square

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
until you get one of the little square

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
until you get one of the little square
ones<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.460> usually<00:00:56.670> takes<00:00:57.000> quite<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> few

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
ones which usually takes quite a few

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.130 
ones which usually takes quite a few
more<00:00:57.629> tries<00:00:57.899> than<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:59.359> as<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.750> collect

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
more tries than that as well as collect

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
more tries than that as well as collect
this<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.440> off<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> pads<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.120> yeah<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this one off the pads and so yeah it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.050 
this one off the pads and so yeah it
sort<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.890> makes<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> game<00:01:05.220> run<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> long

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
sort of makes the game run kind of long

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
sort of makes the game run kind of long
and<00:01:06.299> makes<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:06.810> user<00:01:07.250> unused

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and makes it a little bit user unused

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
and makes it a little bit user unused
friendly<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> came<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
friendly and so what I came up with is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
friendly and so what I came up with is
this<00:01:11.369> over<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.240> basically<00:01:12.750> how<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
this over here so basically how this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
this over here so basically how this
works<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.100> shoot<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> bullseye<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
works is you shoot the bullseye in the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
works is you shoot the bullseye in the
middle<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.860> once<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> you'll<00:01:17.790> see

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
middle and once you do that you'll see

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.380 
middle and once you do that you'll see
the<00:01:18.560> lamps<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> side<00:01:19.979> flash<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> then

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the lamps on the side flash and then

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
the lamps on the side flash and then
it's<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.380> again<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> shoot<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's good to go again so you shoot it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.870 
it's good to go again so you shoot it
again<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.020> just<00:01:25.020> keep<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.490> course<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
again and just keep going of course you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
again and just keep going of course you
can<00:01:27.030> move<00:01:27.600> back<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.280> try<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> lot<00:01:29.549> longer

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
can move back and try a lot longer

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.770 
can move back and try a lot longer
distances<00:01:30.420> makes<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.369> difficult

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
distances makes it a lot more difficult

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.280 
distances makes it a lot more difficult
as<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.920> terrible<00:01:35.549> shot<00:01:36.290> but

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
as you can see I'm a terrible shot but

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
as you can see I'm a terrible shot but
there<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.680> hit<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> bullseye<00:01:38.600> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there we go hit the bullseye so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800 
there we go hit the bullseye so
basically<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> way<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> works<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.630> come<00:01:42.630> back

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
basically the way it works is come back

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.639 
basically the way it works is come back
to<00:01:43.200> behind<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:44.780> here<00:01:45.780> we've<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:46.110> three<00:01:48.649> iron

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to behind here here we've got three iron

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.249 
to behind here here we've got three iron
bars<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> iron<00:01:51.540> bar<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> side

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bars and so the iron bar on the side

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.060 
bars and so the iron bar on the side
here<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.399> triggers<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
here is the one that triggers the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
here is the one that triggers the
circuit<00:01:56.070> over<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.490> side<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.110> triggering

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
circuit over this side here triggering

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
circuit over this side here triggering
this<00:01:58.229> circuit<00:01:58.939> sets<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> other<00:02:00.240> side<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
this circuit sets the other side of this

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.499 
this circuit sets the other side of this
and<00:02:00.990> guide<00:02:01.409> which<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.649> hooked<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and guide which is hooked up to the the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.010 
and guide which is hooked up to the the
clock<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.290> tells<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> piston

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
clock which also tells the piston

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809 
clock which also tells the piston
and<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.560> once<00:02:07.770> both<00:02:08.009> sides<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.670> gate

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and so once both sides of the and gate

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.380 
and so once both sides of the and gate
are<00:02:09.000> powered<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.940> redstone<00:02:11.940> lamps<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
are powered the redstone lamps on the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.690 
are powered the redstone lamps on the
side<00:02:12.629> here<00:02:12.680> able<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.769> flash<00:02:14.010> telling<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.519> that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
side here able to flash telling you that

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.940 
side here able to flash telling you that
you've<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> game<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.290> then<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> signal

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you've on the game and then the signal

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
you've on the game and then the signal
also<00:02:17.280> comes<00:02:17.519> up<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> gate<00:02:18.390> goes

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
also comes up from the and gate goes

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.920 
also comes up from the and gate goes
through<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.620> delay<00:02:19.980> setting<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
through this delay setting so that the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
through this delay setting so that the
Lambs<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.650> time<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> flash<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:24.239> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
Lambs have time to flash and then it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.270 
Lambs have time to flash and then it
fires<00:02:24.540> off<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.110> dispenser<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.920> which

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
fires off this dispenser here which

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.830 
fires off this dispenser here which
resets<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:29.239> wireless<00:02:30.239> redstone<00:02:30.420> signal

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
resets the the wireless redstone signal

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.110 
resets the the wireless redstone signal
so<00:02:31.830> anyway<00:02:32.069> goes<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.519> really<00:02:32.910> quick

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so anyway goes just a really quick

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.150 
so anyway goes just a really quick
application<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.470> circuit<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.129> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
application of the circuit that I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.320 
application of the circuit that I
thought<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.489> guys<00:02:35.580> might<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.819> interested<00:02:35.910> in

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
thought you guys might be interested in

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.000 
thought you guys might be interested in
seeing<00:02:36.569> if<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.379> did<00:02:37.530> enjoy<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.890> video
