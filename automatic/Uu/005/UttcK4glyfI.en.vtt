last two World Cups both GE and Rachel
of<00:00:33.190> them<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.460> double-double<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.960> can't<00:00:35.140> be

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
of them the double-double we can't be

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.680 
of them the double-double we can't be
more<00:00:35.470> happy<00:00:35.980> about<00:00:36.010> that<00:00:36.460> it<00:00:37.210> just<00:00:37.269> shows<00:00:37.629> that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
more happy about that it just shows that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.340 
more happy about that it just shows that
the<00:00:37.900> fruits<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.230> our<00:00:38.350> labor<00:00:38.410> are<00:00:38.800> paying<00:00:39.129> off

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the fruits of our labor are paying off

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.870 
the fruits of our labor are paying off
so<00:00:41.350> details<00:00:41.829> about<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.309> frame<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.730> we're

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
so details about the frame that we're

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.940 
so details about the frame that we're
going<00:00:42.969> to<00:00:43.030> get<00:00:43.210> into<00:00:43.510> obviously<00:00:44.230> number<00:00:44.829> one

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
going to get into obviously number one

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.299 
going to get into obviously number one
it's<00:00:45.460> not<00:00:45.550> carbon<00:00:46.120> like<00:00:46.300> our<00:00:46.450> old<00:00:46.600> bike<00:00:46.840> was

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
it's not carbon like our old bike was

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's not carbon like our old bike was
you<00:00:48.309> know<00:00:48.399> one<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.730> reasons<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.180> we<00:00:49.329> were

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
you know one of the reasons that we were

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.229 
you know one of the reasons that we were
able<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.629> do<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.620> you<00:00:51.399> know<00:00:51.489> prototyping

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
able to do that is you know prototyping

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.389 
able to do that is you know prototyping
being<00:00:52.629> able<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.809> change<00:00:53.020> things<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:54.309> the

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
being able to change things and the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.770 
being able to change things and the
first<00:00:54.579> year<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:54.969> design<00:00:55.270> it<00:00:55.450> was<00:00:55.510> really

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
first year of a design it was really

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
first year of a design it was really
nice<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.079> be<00:00:56.110> able<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.320> have<00:00:56.469> an<00:00:56.590> aluminum

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
nice to be able to have an aluminum

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.700 
nice to be able to have an aluminum
frame<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.840> difference<00:00:59.230> there<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.500> that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
frame but the difference there is that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.610 
frame but the difference there is that
number<00:01:00.039> one<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.940> bike<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.570> frame<00:01:01.840> alone<00:01:02.320> is

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
number one is bike the frame alone is

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.529 
number one is bike the frame alone is
300<00:01:03.100> grams<00:01:03.250> lighter<00:01:03.550> than<00:01:03.910> last<00:01:04.270> year's

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
300 grams lighter than last year's

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.260 
300 grams lighter than last year's
carbon<00:01:04.930> frame<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.860> 500<00:01:06.490> grams<00:01:06.670> lighter<00:01:06.970> than

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
carbon frame it's 500 grams lighter than

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.930 
carbon frame it's 500 grams lighter than
last<00:01:07.450> year's<00:01:07.660> alloy<00:01:07.990> frame<00:01:08.229> it's<00:01:09.009> 26<00:01:09.580> percent

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
last year's alloy frame it's 26 percent

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.210 
last year's alloy frame it's 26 percent
stiffer<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.600> head<00:01:10.750> tube<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.259> three<00:01:12.009> four

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
stiffer and the head tube and three four

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.580 
stiffer and the head tube and three four
percent<00:01:12.369> stiffer<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> bottom<00:01:13.479> bracket<00:01:13.600> so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
percent stiffer in the bottom bracket so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.990 
percent stiffer in the bottom bracket so
those<00:01:14.770> numbers<00:01:14.890> are<00:01:15.100> pretty<00:01:15.310> staggering<00:01:15.400> I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
those numbers are pretty staggering I

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.240 
those numbers are pretty staggering I
know<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.299> hard<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.570> believe<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.830> all<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.159> all

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
know it's hard to believe but all in all

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.920 
know it's hard to believe but all in all
it<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.549> true<00:01:18.939> we've<00:01:19.210> done<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.510> testing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
it is true we've done the testing

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.990 
it is true we've done the testing
ourselves<00:01:20.110> our<00:01:20.799> own<00:01:20.830> bikes<00:01:21.250> versus<00:01:21.729> our<00:01:21.850> own

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
ourselves our own bikes versus our own

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.190 
ourselves our own bikes versus our own
bikes<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.630> those<00:01:22.750> are<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.960> numbers<00:01:22.990> that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
bikes and those are the numbers that

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.130 
bikes and those are the numbers that
basically<00:01:23.619> came<00:01:23.860> back<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.720> what<00:01:25.900> you've<00:01:26.020> been

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
basically came back so what you've been

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.350 
basically came back so what you've been
able<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.439> see<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> bike<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.400> will<00:01:28.000> be<00:01:28.180> able

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
able to see is a bike that will be able

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.999 
able to see is a bike that will be able
to<00:01:28.450> be<00:01:28.509> proved<00:01:28.869> itself<00:01:29.290> on<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.619> World<00:01:29.799> Cup

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
to be proved itself on the World Cup

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.090 
to be proved itself on the World Cup
circuit<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.150> what<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.420> built<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.780> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
circuit and that is what we built it for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.740 
circuit and that is what we built it for
other<00:01:33.100> main<00:01:33.430> features<00:01:33.909> of<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.299> new<00:01:34.330> design

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
other main features of the new design

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.069 
other main features of the new design
here<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.159> we<00:01:36.310> basically<00:01:36.490> took<00:01:36.880> away<00:01:37.119> the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
here is that we basically took away the

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.810 
here is that we basically took away the
majority<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.799> forgings<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.579> frame

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
majority of the forgings on the frame

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.550 
majority of the forgings on the frame
one<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.659> things<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.930> we<00:01:41.020> want<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.259> do<00:01:41.409> in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
one of the things that we want to do in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.679 
one of the things that we want to do in
order<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.799> light<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.189> up<00:01:42.310> was<00:01:43.240> basically<00:01:43.540> with

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
order to light it up was basically with

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.260 
order to light it up was basically with
all<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.049> forgings<00:01:44.500> they're<00:01:45.250> very<00:01:45.520> strong<00:01:45.850> but

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
all the forgings they're very strong but

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.270 
all the forgings they're very strong but
they're<00:01:46.390> also<00:01:46.600> extremely<00:01:47.500> heavy<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.070> they're

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
they're also extremely heavy and they're

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.429 
they're also extremely heavy and they're
very<00:01:48.460> expensive<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:49.780> order<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.990> keep<00:01:50.140> cost

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
very expensive so in order to keep cost

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.990

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.979 
suspension
is<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.430> basically<00:02:18.700> took<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> ID<00:02:19.329> system

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
is that we basically took the ID system

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.220 
is that we basically took the ID system
and<00:02:20.260> changed<00:02:20.859> it<00:02:20.950> around<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.340> lot<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:22.989> main

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
and changed it around a lot the one main

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.289 
and changed it around a lot the one main
thing<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.709> wanted<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.069> do<00:02:24.219> was<00:02:24.760> put<00:02:24.939> as<00:02:25.030> much<00:02:25.239> of

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
thing we wanted to do was put as much of

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.080 
thing we wanted to do was put as much of
the<00:02:25.540> riders<00:02:25.870> weight<00:02:25.989> as<00:02:26.200> possible<00:02:26.859> onto<00:02:27.579> the

main axle this in turn allows the rear
suspension<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.689> able<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.019> what<00:02:32.170> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
suspension to be able to do what it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.619 
suspension to be able to do what it
needs<00:02:32.439> to<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:33.609> is<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.849> rearward<00:02:34.239> arcing

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
needs to do this is a rearward arcing

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.390 
needs to do this is a rearward arcing
rear<00:02:34.840> suspension<00:02:35.439> really<00:02:35.739> similar<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
rear suspension really similar to the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.830 
rear suspension really similar to the

out with in 2014 but the pedaling

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.629 
out with in 2014 but the pedaling
characteristics<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.250> bike<00:02:42.459> are<00:02:42.609> a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
characteristics is of this bike are a

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.390 
characteristics is of this bike are a
lot<00:02:42.849> different<00:02:43.170> when<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.290> look<00:02:44.319> at<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:44.829> you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
lot different when you look at what you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.949 
lot different when you look at what you
know<00:02:45.489> downhill<00:02:45.909> racers<00:02:46.269> are<00:02:46.420> dealing<00:02:46.659> with<00:02:46.689> on

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
know downhill racers are dealing with on

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.390 
know downhill racers are dealing with on
a<00:02:46.989> World<00:02:47.260> Cup<00:02:47.469> level<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:47.859> mean<00:02:48.040> even<00:02:48.280> at

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
a World Cup level I mean even at

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.890 
a World Cup level I mean even at
national<00:02:48.879> level<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.269> just<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
national level or just going to the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.080 
national level or just going to the
resort<00:02:50.230> you're<00:02:51.069> typically<00:02:51.400> pedaling<00:02:51.879> on<00:02:52.030> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
resort you're typically pedaling on a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.140 
resort you're typically pedaling on a
bike<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.659> on<00:02:52.900> trails<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:54.069> are<00:02:54.129> really<00:02:54.939> rough

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
bike and on trails that are really rough

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.909 
bike and on trails that are really rough
really<00:02:55.599> rocky<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.409> you<00:02:56.500> need<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.799> as

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
really rocky and so you need to have as

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.069 
really rocky and so you need to have as
a<00:02:56.950> suspension<00:02:57.430> there's<00:02:58.060> me<00:02:58.329> soaking<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.840> up

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
a suspension there's me soaking that up

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.929 
a suspension there's me soaking that up
but<00:02:59.680> with<00:02:59.829> our<00:02:59.980> independent<00:03:00.250> drivetrain

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
but with our independent drivetrain

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.580 
but with our independent drivetrain
system<00:03:01.389> and<00:03:01.510> what<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:01.719> allows<00:03:01.900> us<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.139> do<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
system and what it allows us to do is to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.349 
system and what it allows us to do is to
design<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.859> bike<00:03:03.099> that<00:03:03.310> pedals<00:03:03.579> extremely<00:03:04.180> well

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
design a bike that pedals extremely well

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.990 
design a bike that pedals extremely well
over<00:03:04.750> very<00:03:05.200> very<00:03:05.530> rough<00:03:05.829> terrain<00:03:06.040> instead<00:03:06.879> of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
over very very rough terrain instead of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.490 
over very very rough terrain instead of
designing<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.569> bike<00:03:07.689> to<00:03:07.840> pedal<00:03:08.109> really<00:03:08.260> well

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
designing the bike to pedal really well

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.539 
designing the bike to pedal really well
say<00:03:08.829> in<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.129> parking<00:03:09.489> lot<00:03:11.099> which<00:03:12.099> has<00:03:12.370> been

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
say in a parking lot which has been

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.369 
say in a parking lot which has been
proven<00:03:13.000> obviously<00:03:13.689> you've<00:03:13.840> seen<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.169> on<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
proven obviously you've seen it on the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.039 
proven obviously you've seen it on the
World<00:03:14.560> Cup<00:03:14.799> but<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:15.909> in<00:03:16.030> all<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.389> very<00:03:16.510> very

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
World Cup but all in all it's very very

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.170 
World Cup but all in all it's very very
efficient<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.280> very<00:03:18.579> small<00:03:18.939> we<00:03:19.120> were

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
efficient and it's very small we were

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.909 
efficient and it's very small we were
able<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.389> tuck<00:03:19.689> it<00:03:19.840> up<00:03:19.930> inside<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.439> frame<00:03:20.680> and

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
able to tuck it up inside the frame and

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.250 
able to tuck it up inside the frame and
make<00:03:21.699> it<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.879> lot<00:03:22.150> stiffer<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.870> that's<00:03:23.079> where

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
make it a lot stiffer and that's where

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.420 
make it a lot stiffer and that's where
you're<00:03:23.379> seeing<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.680> lot<00:03:23.859> of<00:03:23.889> that<00:03:24.099> stiffness

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
you're seeing a lot of that stiffness

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.500 
you're seeing a lot of that stiffness

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
non-drive side of the bike is a lot

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.149 
non-drive side of the bike is a lot
thicker<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.599> sits<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.079> lot<00:03:35.260> more<00:03:35.680> off<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.069> the

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
thicker and sits a lot more off to the

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.429 
thicker and sits a lot more off to the
left<00:03:36.669> side<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> frame<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:38.199> then<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
left side of the frame and then the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.869 
left side of the frame and then the
right<00:03:38.620> side<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.010> that's<00:03:39.069> dudas<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.790> we

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
right side and that's dudas so that we

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.539 
right side and that's dudas so that we
can<00:03:40.030> get<00:03:40.180> great<00:03:40.870> chain<00:03:41.139> line<00:03:41.379> great<00:03:42.010> stiffness

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
can get great chain line great stiffness

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.159 
can get great chain line great stiffness
as<00:03:42.970> well<00:03:43.209> as<00:03:43.299> make<00:03:43.449> sure<00:03:43.479> that<00:03:43.780> we<00:03:43.900> were<00:03:43.989> using

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
as well as make sure that we were using

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.159 
as well as make sure that we were using
every<00:03:44.650> piece<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> bottom<00:03:45.549> bracket<00:03:46.169> area

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
every piece of the bottom bracket area

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.369 
every piece of the bottom bracket area
as<00:03:47.319> we<00:03:47.500> possibly<00:03:47.949> could<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:49.120> then<00:03:50.109> there<00:03:50.290> was

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
as we possibly could and then there was

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.860 
as we possibly could and then there was
some<00:03:50.560> really<00:03:50.979> major<00:03:51.129> geometry<00:03:51.879> changes<00:03:52.299> we

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
some really major geometry changes we

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.379 
some really major geometry changes we
shortened<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.409> rear<00:03:53.590> end<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.949> bunch<00:03:54.389> really

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
shortened the rear end a bunch really

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.920 
shortened the rear end a bunch really
lengthen<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.139> top<00:03:56.349> tube<00:03:56.620> it's<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.919> lot<00:03:57.129> longer

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
lengthen the top tube it's a lot longer

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.360 
lengthen the top tube it's a lot longer
and<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.019> we<00:03:59.109> also<00:03:59.409> designed<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.859> bikes<00:04:00.069> around

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
and so we also designed the bikes around

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.969 
and so we also designed the bikes around
a<00:04:00.459> 30<00:04:00.699> millimeter<00:04:00.939> stem<00:04:01.509> so<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.439> front<00:04:02.680> center

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
a 30 millimeter stem so the front center

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.429 
a 30 millimeter stem so the front center
of<00:04:03.099> these<00:04:03.189> bikes<00:04:03.459> are<00:04:03.759> very<00:04:03.970> long<00:04:04.319> but<00:04:05.319> with

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
of these bikes are very long but with

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.140 
of these bikes are very long but with
the<00:04:05.620> shorter<00:04:05.949> stem<00:04:06.220> it's<00:04:06.729> going<00:04:06.879> to<00:04:06.939> give<00:04:07.060> you

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
the shorter stem it's going to give you

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.780 
the shorter stem it's going to give you
a<00:04:07.180> lot<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.389> control<00:04:07.799> these<00:04:08.799> bikes<00:04:09.069> stock<00:04:09.519> will

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
a lot of control these bikes stock will

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.240 
a lot of control these bikes stock will
come<00:04:09.939> up<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> 30<00:04:10.540> 50<00:04:11.109> mil<00:04:11.290> adjustable<00:04:11.979> so

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
come up with a 30 50 mil adjustable so

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.309 
come up with a 30 50 mil adjustable so
you<00:04:12.909> can<00:04:13.030> have<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.329> 30<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.109> bike

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
you can have the 30 you can have a bike

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.689 
you can have the 30 you can have a bike
that<00:04:14.530> will<00:04:14.590> feel<00:04:14.799> very<00:04:15.069> similar<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.579> your

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
that will feel very similar to your

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.339 
that will feel very similar to your
previous<00:04:15.909> bike<00:04:16.269> if<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.959> want<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.199> start

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
previous bike if you want to start

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.719 
previous bike if you want to start
pushing<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.829> limits<00:04:18.159> and<00:04:18.310> go<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> little<00:04:18.489> bit

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
pushing the limits and go a little bit

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.060 
pushing the limits and go a little bit
further<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.389> G<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.870> Rachel<00:04:20.199> are<00:04:20.289> doing<00:04:20.590> to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
further like G and Rachel are doing to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
further like G and Rachel are doing to
basically<00:04:21.280> try<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.609> find<00:04:22.020> that<00:04:23.020> extra<00:04:23.440> little

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
basically try and find that extra little

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.990 
basically try and find that extra little
second<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.310> extra<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> little<00:04:24.639> bit<00:04:24.880> of

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
second and the extra a little bit of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.550 
second and the extra a little bit of
confidence<00:04:25.450> on<00:04:25.630> an<00:04:25.750> early<00:04:26.020> descent

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
confidence on an early descent

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.230 
confidence on an early descent
you<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.490> adjust<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.940> stem<00:04:28.180> outward

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
you can adjust the stem outward

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.969 
you can adjust the stem outward
all-in-all<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.169> model<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:31.889> in

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
all-in-all on the model that you see in
