00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
in 0.53 instrumental it's very difficult

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
in 0.53 instrumental it's very difficult
to<00:01:40.440> spot<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:41.760> need<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.000> tap<00:01:42.300> out<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.900> able

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.609 

but<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.880> fairly<00:01:51.240> common<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:52.020> these

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
but they are fairly common at these

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.219 
but they are fairly common at these
sites<00:01:52.979> whether<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:54.090> transfer<00:01:54.719> this<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
sites whether they transfer this to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.850 
sites whether they transfer this to
