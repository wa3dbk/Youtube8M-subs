00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
but not too bad stick is quite

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.650 
but not too bad stick is quite
responsive<00:00:37.430> anyway<00:00:38.430> here's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> game<00:00:39.420> online

so you can see the responsiveness I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.900

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.960 

hey<00:01:03.910> yes<00:01:04.120> their<00:01:04.360> plate<00:01:04.690> but<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.350> assume<00:01:06.130> -<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.760> was

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
hey yes their plate but I assume - I was

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.920 
hey yes their plate but I assume - I was
only<00:01:07.120> just<00:01:07.390> getting<00:01:07.630> used<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.870> I<00:01:07.960> suppose<00:01:08.350> but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
only just getting used to I suppose but

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.359 
only just getting used to I suppose but
when<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:10.960> was<00:01:11.110> fighting<00:01:11.380> online<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.950> seemed<00:01:12.190> to

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
when I was fighting online it seemed to

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.300 
when I was fighting online it seemed to
really<00:01:12.580> lag<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.270> not<00:01:13.479> pull<00:01:13.690> out<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> moves<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
really lag and not pull out the moves so

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:29.400 
really lag and not pull out the moves so
hey<00:01:15.550> guys<00:01:26.100> okay<00:01:27.240> sometimes<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.450> tends<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.110> jump

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
hey guys okay sometimes it tends to jump

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:40.770 
hey guys okay sometimes it tends to jump
a<00:01:29.590> lot<00:01:29.770> but<00:01:30.640> instead<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.030> doing<00:01:31.869> what<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.229> want

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.660 

it<00:01:41.780> doesn't<00:01:42.200> always<00:01:42.409> pull<00:01:42.799> off<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> Dickens<00:01:43.549> of

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
it doesn't always pull off a Dickens of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.730 
it doesn't always pull off a Dickens of
its<00:01:48.939> best<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.210> side<00:01:50.479> either<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:51.049> try<00:01:51.679> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
its best on this side either I try and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
its best on this side either I try and
do<00:01:51.950> pull<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:52.670> oh<00:01:52.819> it's<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.149> combo<00:01:53.329> move

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.789 

as<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> best<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
as you can see I'm not the best and I

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.109 
as you can see I'm not the best and I
struggle<00:02:07.799> sometimes<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> moves<00:02:08.880> off

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
struggle sometimes to get the moves off

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
struggle sometimes to get the moves off
it<00:02:09.600> sort<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.800> ends<00:02:11.069> up<00:02:11.130> doing<00:02:11.310> hide<00:02:11.700> your

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it sort of just ends up doing hide your

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.540 
it sort of just ends up doing hide your
punches<00:02:12.660> some<00:02:13.140> reason<00:02:13.470> I'll<00:02:14.100> try<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
punches some reason I'll try and do a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:50.550 
punches some reason I'll try and do a
back<00:02:14.819> kick<00:02:15.209> okay<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:18.410> okay

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.940 
I want to get my ought to move off in
the<00:02:53.349> can<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.540> go<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.110> not<00:02:59.290> too<00:02:59.500> hard<00:02:59.770> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
the can there we go it's not too hard to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.429 
the can there we go it's not too hard to
get<00:03:00.130> into<00:03:00.280> it

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.720 

pretty<00:03:05.439> responsive<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.219> far<00:03:06.430> I'm<00:03:06.489> quite

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
pretty responsive so far I'm quite

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.789 
pretty responsive so far I'm quite
impressed<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:07.629> is<00:03:07.749> the<00:03:07.840> first<00:03:08.109> arcade<00:03:08.499> stick

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
impressed this is the first arcade stick

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.289 
impressed this is the first arcade stick
abused<00:03:09.129> though<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:10.329> feel<00:03:11.109> that<00:03:11.999> the<00:03:12.999> actual

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
abused though I feel that the actual

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.979 
abused though I feel that the actual
stick<00:03:13.629> could<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.200> bit<00:03:14.319> tighter<00:03:14.590> but

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
stick could be a little bit tighter but

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:39.140 
stick could be a little bit tighter but
I<00:03:16.989> am<00:03:17.260> holding<00:03:17.499> it<00:03:17.620> quite<00:03:17.859> far<00:03:18.069> away<00:03:18.159> from<00:03:18.459> me

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.900 

I've<00:03:40.150> got<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.480> from<00:03:40.690> Amazon<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.730> do

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
I've got this from Amazon so and they do

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.640 
I've got this from Amazon so and they do
a<00:03:42.940> good<00:03:43.180> return<00:03:43.450> policy<00:03:44.050> if<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.230> don't<00:03:44.440> want

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
a good return policy if you don't want

00:03:44.650 --> 00:04:10.380 
a good return policy if you don't want
it<00:03:44.769> so

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.839 

aha<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.319> cot<00:04:12.829> I'm<00:04:13.069> never<00:04:13.340> really<00:04:13.489> playing

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
aha just a cot I'm never really playing

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.360 
aha just a cot I'm never really playing
arcade<00:04:14.299> stick<00:04:14.569> before<00:04:14.689> but<00:04:15.049> seems<00:04:15.860> alright<00:04:16.130> I

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
arcade stick before but seems alright I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.129 
arcade stick before but seems alright I
think<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:16.880> down<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.509> opponent<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.049> you

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
think it's down to the opponent that you

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.830 
think it's down to the opponent that you
play<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:18.859> hopefully<00:04:19.549> this<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:19.759> how<00:04:20.000> sorry<00:04:20.630> for

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
play so hopefully this is how sorry for

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.300
