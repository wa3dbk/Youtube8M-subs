00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.149
 ah 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.680
 greetings web surfers today I bring you a 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.139
 small Venezuelan recipe and that is the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.490
 small is a stick of hard cheese 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.170
 saladito 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.849
 that would be like an appetizer 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.369
 a lid that is used in the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.550
 Venezuelan celebrations and without more 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 we are going to make the ingredients 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.140
 we have flour we will add in a bowl two 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.110
 Cups of Flour 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.470
 of force because it is a bread dough 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.980
 we will do in the middle of a kind of 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.780
 chick what is called to be a volcano 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 and we'll pour all the products there 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.140
 liquid the butter that we have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.140
 previously melted 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 the egg 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.460
 and to amalgamate the mass we will have a 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.000
 little water where we will have added 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.309
 a teaspoon of salt and sugar to taste 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.270
 we remove it a little 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.270
 and 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.890
 and we will add it first, we can 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.350
 stir the egg a bit and the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.730
 butter and little by little we will go 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 adding the water 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.869
 we will add first 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.320
 a trickle and we will begin to join all 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.320
 the ingredients 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.970
 it's like a bread dough 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 is the part that has a little bit more of 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 preparation of the recipe 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.720
 so that a well-linked dough remains 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.630
 well elastic, we can not 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.310
 Exceed a lot with water because also 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.520
 we can have a mass too much 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 soft that after frying the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.800
 undo 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 and already in this step that the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.890
 mass of bottom of bowl and sides 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.800
 I will begin to knead it with my hands 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.120
 take a little bit of flour this is a 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.760
 work a little delicate but has 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.500
 to be done with your hands and good 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'll stay for a while because you have to pass it 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 very well so that it is light 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.850
 Well, we've been here a little while 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.410
 kneading with your hands and as you can see 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.819
 we have a very elastic mass 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.459
 bright has to be a mass like that 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.760
 of soft type and when we do 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.440
 so that is very malleable is a mass 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.010
 very malleable then what we will do 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.830
 now 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.140
 It's in our kneading board 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.890
 we will add flour as would any 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.200
 pitcher or a little bit of flour on the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.300
 base we will extend our mass 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.730
 as much as we can and with the help of a 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.260
 roll that we have previously had 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.650
 Floured I'm going to marinate it 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.220
 little bit more so that it does not stick 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.830
 we will start to stretch the dough 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.050
 the interesting thing about the little ones of the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.820
 mass of the little ones is that you have to 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.820
 remain a very finite mass 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.600
 we have to go extending towards all 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.600
 the sides 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.710
 Venezuelans say that when they are 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.000
 are seeing this kind of masses 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.450
 they use a term that is dale palette 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.820
 because you have to be a lot of time 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.000
 extending it so that it is finite 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.660
 and then you will see how I am going to proceed 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.670
 to stretch it and cut it and do the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.340
 strips with which we are going to do our 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.340
 pass stick and I stay here a little while 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.530
 well, we already have our mass almost 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.010
 list as you can see is a mass that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.700
 it looks like a telita 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.320
 we had to knead it 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.470
 approximately how to stretch it with some 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.140
 20 minutes gives a little work but 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.689
 it 's worth it and now what we will proceed 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.879
 to do 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:34.599
 I already had it a little bit cut off 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:38.660
 here irregular is to leave as a kind 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:41.900
 rectangular cloth very regular 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.310
 and we will make thin strips cutting 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:49.520
 with the knife thin strips of 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:54.780
 approximately half finger width 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.570
 it's not a very exact thing either 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.960
 but that's how we'll do it once 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.520
 we have these strips cut is that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.250
 we proceed to elaborate our little ones 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.070
 they see that it is that it gives all finite we already have 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.600
 our cheese taquitos that also 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.720
 They are cut to one centimeter 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.730
 approximately thus this size 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.740
 and I 'm going to show you the first way 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.430
 how it is wrapped we can do it from this 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:25.050
 way by leaving a surplus we plug the 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:30.840
 small and longitudinally what 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.840
 we wrap and then we start to spin 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.889
 doing as a kind of bandage 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.800
 on the cheese taquito 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.400
 This is how I know 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.759
 the small one is elaborated and in the part 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.819
 final this bit this end that we 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.759
 remains of mass simply as it is a 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.490
 very elastic mass and very sticky what 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.430
 we squeeze and squeeze the other one 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:02.050
 extreme that what is called the little hand 2 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.050
 we had it for a little bit of flour 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.740
 that we do not have a good excess left 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.949
 we have our first small we are going to 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.150
 proceed to make another one as another type 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.670
 in a way to do it 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.060
 the second way is to simply go 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.230
 wrapping the cheese taquito 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.390
 we start 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.830
 we leave an excellent always for 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.300
 after 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.150
 here stop the edge cited and as well as the 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.740
 bandage like a mummy 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.740
 thank you very much to do this 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.349
 the people of the teques from where it is 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.090
 origin this at least from here we do not 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.419
 we exceeded a little bit we can cut with 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.419
 hand 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.280
 we close this is so that it simply does not 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.080
 the cheese is going to come out 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.750
 the people of the teques do it with their 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.060
 families put children to grandparents 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.770
 to everyone make little ones because 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.150
 this is used in celebrations and 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.150
 at weddings good I will make you one more 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.789
 because it's a little bit tangled up to me 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:14.480
 like more the longitudinal shape I leave 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:17.950
 always a surplus I pass it from behind 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.950
 and we started to bandage 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.599
 well today this broke me no matter no 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.599
 we stick 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.080
 we go round and round is that you have to 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.660
 do it delicately because it's very 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:36.100
 soft and very finite the dough 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:41.009
 and we meditate, we lock our little 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:44.569
 we wrap it and that's it 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:44.569
 ready to take them to learn 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.360
 well here we have our little ones the 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.880
 result that remained crispy 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.770
 with his heart of cheese that is very 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.380
 fried in hot oil is very 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.510
 important and good we can eat them 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.990
 alone or can also be accompanied by 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.790
 a sauce of cheese or tomato sauce and 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.430
 they honor the city that gives them 

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:11.260
 the venezuela teques originated and 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.260
 until another video and enjoy them
