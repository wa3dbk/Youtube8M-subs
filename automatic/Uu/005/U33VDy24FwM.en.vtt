line and you're going to want to cut
that<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.469> carefully<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> craft<00:01:03.239> knife

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that very carefully with a craft knife

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
that very carefully with a craft knife
that's<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> roof<00:01:04.589> tabs<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.309> fit<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that's so that the roof tabs can fit in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
that's so that the roof tabs can fit in
so<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.479> box<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.290> open<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> close

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so that way your box can open and close

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.910 
so that way your box can open and close
from<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> top<00:01:08.900> now<00:01:09.900> I've<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.560> cut<00:01:10.890> out

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
from the top now I've got it all cut out

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.690 
from the top now I've got it all cut out
and<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.939> took<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.530> under<00:01:13.530> five<00:01:13.920> minutes<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and that took me under five minutes it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
and that took me under five minutes it
really<00:01:14.729> didn't<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.479> long<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.740> longest

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
really didn't take very long the longest

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
really didn't take very long the longest
part<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.270> cutting<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.530> little

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
part is just cutting out the little

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
part is just cutting out the little
lines<00:01:20.159> using<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> craft<00:01:21.330> knife<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
lines using the craft knife you just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.289 
lines using the craft knife you just
want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.350> very<00:01:22.590> careful<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
want to be very careful on that and the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.990 
want to be very careful on that and the
next<00:01:24.479> step<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.710> need<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.100> score<00:01:26.670> all

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
next step is we will need to score all

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.710 
next step is we will need to score all
of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.689> dotted<00:01:28.170> lines<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.479> all

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of the dotted lines so you can see all

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.200 
of the dotted lines so you can see all
of<00:01:30.750> these<00:01:31.200> dotted<00:01:31.710> lines<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.579> all<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of these dotted lines on all of the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
of these dotted lines on all of the
pieces<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.770> reason<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

score<00:01:36.119> them<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.540> I'm<00:01:36.810> working<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> heavier

the<00:01:53.820> fold<00:01:54.149> lines<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.960> else<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.799> not

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the fold lines or else they will not

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.020 
the fold lines or else they will not
fold<00:01:56.399> cleanly<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.700> just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
fold cleanly so what I have here is just

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
fold cleanly so what I have here is just
a<00:02:00.210> legal<00:02:00.450> pad<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.350> provides<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:02.579> cushion

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
a legal pad that provides some cushion

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.200 
a legal pad that provides some cushion
for<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.390> surface<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.369> ruler<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for my surface then I have my ruler and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.020 
for my surface then I have my ruler and
then<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> pen<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.680> no<00:02:07.710> ink<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
then I have a pen with no ink in it you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510 
then I have a pen with no ink in it you
could<00:02:09.239> use<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> bone<00:02:09.750> folder<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.379> other<00:02:10.860> scoring

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
could use a bone folder or other scoring

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.559 
could use a bone folder or other scoring
tool<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
tool but this is

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.199 
tool but this is
just<00:02:12.689> a<00:02:12.900> handy<00:02:13.709> tool<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> already<00:02:14.939> have

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
just a handy tool that I already have

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.780 
just a handy tool that I already have
around<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.079> I<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.889> line<00:02:17.129> them<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.549> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
around and I just line them up with the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.699 
around and I just line them up with the
dotted<00:02:18.269> line<00:02:18.450> line<00:02:18.689> up<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> ruler<00:02:19.379> with<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
dotted line line up the ruler with the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.459 
dotted line line up the ruler with the
dotted<00:02:20.069> line<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.609> just<00:02:21.209> draw<00:02:21.540> down<00:02:22.139> it

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
dotted line and then just draw down it

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.129 
dotted line and then just draw down it
and<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.159> can<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.359> makes<00:02:24.659> a<00:02:24.840> really

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
and you can see there it makes a really

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.000 
and you can see there it makes a really
nice<00:02:25.499> score<00:02:26.400> mark<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.120> will<00:02:27.450> fold<00:02:28.010> cleanly

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
nice score mark that will fold cleanly

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.309 
nice score mark that will fold cleanly
so<00:02:29.519> I'm<00:02:29.700> gonna<00:02:29.909> do<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.480> all<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:31.079> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
so I'm gonna do that to all of the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.309 
so I'm gonna do that to all of the
dotted<00:02:31.739> lines<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:32.939> that<00:02:33.209> everything<00:02:33.840> has

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
dotted lines now that everything has

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.490 
dotted lines now that everything has
been<00:02:34.680> scored<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.549> like<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.569> go

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
been scored what I like to do is just go

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.729 
been scored what I like to do is just go
ahead<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.129> pre<00:02:38.579> fold<00:02:39.030> all<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.169> lines<00:02:40.379> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
ahead and pre fold all of the lines this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.399 
ahead and pre fold all of the lines this
make<00:02:41.010> sure<00:02:41.280> you've<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:41.760> nice<00:02:42.120> clean<00:02:42.659> folds

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
double sided tape in it you could just

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.610 
double sided tape in it you could just
use<00:02:58.590> plain<00:02:58.969> double-sided<00:02:59.969> tape<00:03:00.389> regular<00:03:01.349> old

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
that the double-sided tape is faster and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.869 
that the double-sided tape is faster and
we<00:03:07.049> are<00:03:07.139> going<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.500> apply<00:03:07.769> adhesive<00:03:08.219> to<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.760> a
