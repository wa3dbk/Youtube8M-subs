00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
as a professional skater it's considered
a<00:01:54.630> basic<00:01:55.049> trick<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
a basic trick but when you're a little

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700 
a basic trick but when you're a little
kid<00:01:56.399> learning<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.780> took<00:01:57.960> me<00:01:58.140> weeks<00:01:58.439> months

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
kid learning it it took me weeks months

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590 
kid learning it it took me weeks months
probably<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.670> finally<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> trying

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
probably to finally get out of trying

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 
probably to finally get out of trying
over<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.340> over<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.200> over

over and over and over and over and over

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.249 
over and over and over and over and over
and<00:02:04.649> finally<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.159> land<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.759> yeah<00:02:06.450> happiest

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
land two in one day and slowly but

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.740 
land two in one day and slowly but
surely<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.349> up<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.890> teaches<00:02:14.069> you
