he switches out his empty and brings it
as<00:00:45.239> Rikard<00:00:46.910> obviously<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> make<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
as Rikard obviously just to make the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.299 
as Rikard obviously just to make the
type<00:00:49.320> advantage<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:51.590> star<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
type advantage and star up to use a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
type advantage and star up to use a
return<00:00:53.730> those<00:00:54.329> expanded<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.530> who<00:00:55.680> has

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
return those expanded and right who has

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
return those expanded and right who has
really<00:00:56.070> low<00:00:56.309> defense<00:00:56.699> normally<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
really low defense normally it's just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.240 
really low defense normally it's just
one<00:00:58.890> shot<00:00:59.129> set<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.210> fantastic

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
one shot set so that was like fantastic

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
one shot set so that was like fantastic
I<00:01:02.250> couldn't<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:02.879> bother<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.629> edit<00:01:04.199> out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I couldn't actually bother to edit out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.390 
I couldn't actually bother to edit out
the<00:01:04.970> waiting<00:01:05.970> times<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.720> match<00:01:07.229> yes<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the waiting times in this match yes so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570 
the waiting times in this match yes so
although<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.060> normally<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.710> just<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
although I normally do just because this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
although I normally do just because this
guy<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:12.180> pretty<00:01:12.299> quick<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.810> making

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
guy was actually pretty quick at making

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.460 
guy was actually pretty quick at making
his<00:01:13.200> decisions<00:01:13.760> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> rare<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> find<00:01:15.470> at

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
his decisions which is rare to find at

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100 
his decisions which is rare to find at
least<00:01:16.530> anyone<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.340> normally<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.390> far<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
least anyone that's normally as far as I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.060 
least anyone that's normally as far as I
am<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.130> tend<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.439> think<00:01:22.439> things<00:01:22.860> over

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
am because I tend to think things over

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.740 
am because I tend to think things over
you<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> term<00:01:24.240> while<00:01:24.570> they're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you know like the term while they're

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
you know like the term while they're
happening<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.070> already

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
happening and then I kind of already

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
happening and then I kind of already
know<00:01:26.900> normally<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
know normally what I want to do by the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.710 
know normally what I want to do by the
time<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.119> comes<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.450> my

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
time like you know it comes to my

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.219 
time like you know it comes to my
selections<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.049> always

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
selections but you know it's not always

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
selections but you know it's not always
the<00:01:34.350> case<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.820> quite<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.720> too

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the case but this was quite going too

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
the case but this was quite going too
fast<00:01:37.200> factor<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.950> alright<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.000> an

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
fast factor so alright it's just an

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.210 
fast factor so alright it's just an
excuse<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.780> laziness<00:01:40.259> you'll<00:01:40.799> find<00:01:40.950> out

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
excuse for my laziness you'll find out

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.810 
excuse for my laziness you'll find out
but<00:01:41.490> anyway<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.299> suicune<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.380> uses<00:01:43.860> hydro<00:01:44.610> pump

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
but anyway is suicune it uses hydro pump

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
but anyway is suicune it uses hydro pump
which<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.899> fairly<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.350> choice

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
which was again a fairly good choice

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
which was again a fairly good choice
move<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.159> figured<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.909> probably<00:01:48.299> use<00:01:48.329> ice

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
move I figured he would probably use ice

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310 
move I figured he would probably use ice
beam<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.320> he<00:01:49.770> had<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:51.119> Hydra<00:01:51.750> humble<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
beam if he had it but Hydra humble so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.940 
beam if he had it but Hydra humble so
does<00:01:52.850> roughly<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> same<00:01:54.210> amount

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
does roughly the same amount

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.859 
does roughly the same amount
well<00:01:55.369> maybe<00:01:55.610> he<00:01:55.729> predicted<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.210> switch<00:01:56.539> I

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
well maybe he predicted the switch I

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.789 
well maybe he predicted the switch I
deny<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:59.090> know<00:01:59.210> our<00:01:59.360> process<00:01:59.899> now<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:00.439> and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
deny but you know our process now in and

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.130 
deny but you know our process now in and
I<00:02:01.369> decided<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.090> Thunder<00:02:02.360> way<00:02:02.509> because<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.079> know

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
I decided to Thunder way because I know

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.719

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
wave comes off successfully which is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.180 
wave comes off successfully which is
always<00:02:13.160> good<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.760> know<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.959> mine<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.560> knew<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.099> I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
always good I know it mine I knew when I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.650 
always good I know it mine I knew when I
leftovers<00:02:16.670> anyway<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:17.030> was<00:02:17.150> gonna<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.569> I've

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
leftovers anyway I was gonna be I've

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.570 
leftovers anyway I was gonna be I've
taken<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.080> Thunderbolt<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> was

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
taken up the Thunderbolt but I was

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580 
taken up the Thunderbolt but I was
pretty<00:02:19.880> damn<00:02:20.209> certain<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.840> one<00:02:21.080> Thunder<00:02:21.440> Bob

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
pretty damn certain the one Thunder Bob

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.949 
pretty damn certain the one Thunder Bob
wouldn't<00:02:22.390> KO<00:02:23.410> that's<00:02:24.410> weekend<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.430> shots

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
wouldn't KO that's weekend in one shots

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.630 
wouldn't KO that's weekend in one shots
just<00:02:26.959> because<00:02:27.290> suicune<00:02:27.799> has<00:02:28.069> notoriously

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
just because suicune has notoriously

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.380 
just because suicune has notoriously
high<00:02:29.180> defense<00:02:29.630> says<00:02:30.880> both<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.120> them<00:02:32.209> pretty

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
high defense says both of them pretty

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.710 
high defense says both of them pretty
high<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:34.310> was<00:02:34.819> quite<00:02:35.150> right<00:02:35.420> when<00:02:35.569> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
high and I was quite right when it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.289 
high and I was quite right when it
happened<00:02:36.049> so<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:37.880> left<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.239> little

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
happened so just was left with a little

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.930 
happened so just was left with a little
bit<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.569> health<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:39.140> thankfully<00:02:39.890> perhaps<00:02:40.670> but

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
bit of health but thankfully perhaps but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.819 
bit of health but thankfully perhaps but
it<00:02:41.090> would<00:02:41.180> have<00:02:41.269> mattered<00:02:41.450> anyway<00:02:41.720> cuz<00:02:42.200> unless

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
it would have mattered anyway cuz unless

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.190 
it would have mattered anyway cuz unless
like<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.130> hydro<00:02:43.519> pump<00:02:43.700> critical<00:02:44.269> being<00:02:44.630> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
like a hydro pump critical being you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800 
like a hydro pump critical being you
know<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.560> prize<00:02:45.950> with<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.130> supply<00:02:46.459> depends<00:02:46.819> which

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
know a prize with a supply depends which

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.979 
know a prize with a supply depends which
was<00:02:48.489> which<00:02:49.489> would<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.730> been<00:02:49.790> fine<00:02:50.120> anyway<00:02:50.540> so

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
was which would have been fine anyway so

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.650 
was which would have been fine anyway so
I<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:53.000> know<00:02:53.319> throw<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.470> ball<00:02:54.590> again<00:02:54.860> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
I just you know throw the ball again to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.289 
I just you know throw the ball again to
inevitably<00:02:56.660> kill<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.170> suicune<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.150> down<00:02:59.150> it

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
inevitably kill that suicune and down it

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.379 
inevitably kill that suicune and down it
goes<00:02:59.350> I<00:03:00.730> thought<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.850> quite<00:03:01.970> interesting

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
goes I thought was quite interesting

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.120 
goes I thought was quite interesting
that<00:03:02.420> my<00:03:02.959> opponent<00:03:03.230> decides<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.739> use<00:03:03.829> of<00:03:03.980> three

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that my opponent decides to use of three

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.280 
that my opponent decides to use of three
legendary<00:03:04.519> dogs<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:05.090> mean<00:03:05.269> like<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.989> know<00:03:06.019> it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
legendary dogs I mean like you know it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.270 
legendary dogs I mean like you know it
kind<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.470> makes<00:03:06.620> sense<00:03:06.769> having<00:03:07.010> them<00:03:07.190> all

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
kind of makes sense having them all

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.789 
kind of makes sense having them all
together<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:08.600> well<00:03:08.989> just<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.410> laugh<00:03:09.590> or

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
together just well just for a laugh or

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.259 
together just well just for a laugh or
whatever<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.489> know<00:03:10.609> it's<00:03:10.850> kind<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.030> weird

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
whatever but you know it's kind of weird

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.000 
whatever but you know it's kind of weird
that<00:03:11.359> they<00:03:11.600> don't<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:11.959> items<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.709> things

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
that they don't have items and things

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.069 
that they don't have items and things
like<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:13.970> they<00:03:14.269> do<00:03:14.329> see<00:03:14.660> me<00:03:14.870> like

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
like that but they do see me like

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.710 
like that but they do see me like
trained<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:15.709> something<00:03:16.100> or<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:17.030> least<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.569> guy

trained or something or at least the guy
knows<00:03:17.959> what<00:03:17.989> he's<00:03:18.260> doing<00:03:18.590> which<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:18.799> very<00:03:19.130> rare

around first being able to survive an
attack<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.510> went<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.840> thunder<00:03:36.109> wave

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
attack but I went with thunder wave

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.410 
attack but I went with thunder wave
anyway<00:03:36.650> there<00:03:37.609> aren't<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.880> use<00:03:38.030> his<00:03:38.120> fire

blasts<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:40.599> criticals<00:03:41.599> but<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
blasts and it's criticals but it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.470 
blasts and it's criticals but it
probably<00:03:43.250> would<00:03:43.639> have<00:03:43.730> made<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> difference<00:03:44.000> in

have as much bulk needed my sending
staraptor<00:03:53.650> hoping<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.829> I<00:03:54.919> can<00:03:54.980> actually<00:03:55.190> pay

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
staraptor hoping that I can actually pay

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.229 
staraptor hoping that I can actually pay
oh<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.299> in<00:03:56.450> one<00:03:56.599> hit<00:03:57.940> intimidate<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.150> it

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
oh this in one hit intimidate but it

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.150 
oh this in one hit intimidate but it
seems<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.540> be<00:03:59.599> like<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:00.650> they<00:04:00.829> were<00:04:00.950> worth

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
seems to be like if then they were worth

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.300 
seems to be like if then they were worth
we<00:04:01.340> drove<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.760> seemed<00:04:01.940> like<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> special<00:04:02.599> attack

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
we drove it seemed like a special attack

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.370 
we drove it seemed like a special attack

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
sinking well you know I know and take a

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.440 
sinking well you know I know and take a
slightly<00:04:08.990> bit<00:04:09.320> better<00:04:09.560> defense<00:04:10.040> than<00:04:10.450> raikou

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
slightly bit better defense than raikou

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.120 
slightly bit better defense than raikou
so<00:04:11.660> if<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.900> go<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.140> brave<00:04:12.530> birds<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.100> know

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130

so if I go with brave birds you know
that's<00:04:13.520> more<00:04:13.730> powerful<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.270> return<00:04:14.600> was<00:04:14.840> so

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
that's more powerful in return was so

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.960 
that's more powerful in return was so
that's<00:04:15.260> surely<00:04:15.650> will<00:04:15.800> KO<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.640> hit<00:04:16.820> you

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that's surely will KO and one hit you

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.300 
that's surely will KO and one hit you
know<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.660> makes<00:04:17.810> perfect<00:04:18.020> sense<00:04:18.320> right<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
know it makes perfect sense right the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
know it makes perfect sense right the
wrong<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:21.680> almost<00:04:22.040> Kerr's<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.970> because<00:04:23.180> it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
wrong it almost Kerr's it because it

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.390 
wrong it almost Kerr's it because it
probably<00:04:23.540> about<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:23.900> 10<00:04:24.350> HP<00:04:24.500> left<00:04:24.890> by<00:04:25.100> oh<00:04:25.130> I

probably about like 10 HP left by oh I

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.840 
probably about like 10 HP left by oh I
take<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.670> crap<00:04:26.510> ton<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:27.160> recoil<00:04:28.160> damage<00:04:28.610> and

take a crap ton of recoil damage and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.670 
take a crap ton of recoil damage and
surprisingly<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.660> uses<00:04:29.810> five<00:04:30.110> last<00:04:30.380> again

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
surprisingly and it uses five last again

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.910

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
which was annoying but you know I kind

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.940 
which was annoying but you know I kind
of<00:04:38.450> rest<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.050> little<00:04:39.200> bit<00:04:39.350> if<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.560> gone<00:04:39.800> with

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
of rest it a little bit if I gone with

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.010 
of rest it a little bit if I gone with
return<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:41.360> still<00:04:41.570> would<00:04:41.660> have<00:04:41.690> been<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:41.960> a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
to hear KO but they probably wonder if

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.310
