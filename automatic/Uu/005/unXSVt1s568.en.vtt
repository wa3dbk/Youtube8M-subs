00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
learn on the continent cuts my pants

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
learn on the continent cuts my pants
because<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.930> too<00:00:39.989> long<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
because like way too long have to do

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.389 
because like way too long have to do
after<00:00:41.820> stuff<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.280> as<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
after stuff right here so just as you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.610 
after stuff right here so just as you
can<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.300> trigger<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.379> now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can see this little trigger it here now

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.299 
can see this little trigger it here now
I<00:00:47.030> take<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.809> figure<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
I take this and take my figure this is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.510 
I take this and take my figure this is
pretty<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.370> what

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
pretty much do this and then I see what

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.460 
pretty much do this and then I see what
an<00:00:53.579> iron<00:00:53.820> poles<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.270> then

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.810 

and<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.100> should<00:01:04.340> look<00:01:04.720> something<00:01:05.720> like<00:01:06.140> this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
and I should look something like this

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.750 
and I should look something like this
when<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.880> trim<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.180> edges<00:01:08.480> on<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:08.980> seat<00:01:09.980> this

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
when you trim the edges on the seat this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.670 
when you trim the edges on the seat this
isn't<00:01:11.510> actually<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.810> same<00:01:12.050> thing<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
isn't actually the same thing with you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.000 
isn't actually the same thing with you
this<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.190> nothing<00:01:13.430> i'm<00:01:13.520> trading<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:14.060> um<00:01:15.010> yes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
this is nothing i'm trading to um yes

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.070 
this is nothing i'm trading to um yes
Karan<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:16.550> think<00:01:16.790> just<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.420> very<00:01:17.570> housing

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
Karan and I think just the very housing

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.650 
Karan and I think just the very housing
that's<00:01:18.440> essentially<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> same<00:01:19.100> thing<00:01:19.160> just

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
that's essentially the same thing just

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.120 
that's essentially the same thing just
take<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:21.940> cut<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.560> hope<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.710> think<00:01:25.010> it's

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
take this cut to hope you think it's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.260 
take this cut to hope you think it's
gonna<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:26.180> like<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:28.040> stuff<00:01:28.250> cut<00:01:28.820> through

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
gonna be it's like the stuff cut through

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.880 
gonna be it's like the stuff cut through
that<00:01:30.280> Ken<00:01:31.280> exactly<00:01:32.080> well<00:01:33.080> just<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.650> take<00:01:33.800> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
that Ken exactly well just you take the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.170 
that Ken exactly well just you take the
picture<00:01:34.660> after<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:37.130> cut<00:01:37.610> off<00:01:37.729> all<00:01:37.910> about

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
picture after just cut off all about

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.990 
picture after just cut off all about
side<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.290> wonderful<00:01:39.650> chance<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.190> check<00:01:40.490> just

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
side the wonderful chance to check just

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.090 
side the wonderful chance to check just
gather<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.360> figure<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.770> actually

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
gather the figure it just it actually

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.190 
gather the figure it just it actually
actually<00:01:43.220> bows<00:01:43.460> arm<00:01:43.700> through<00:01:44.260> here<00:01:45.260> and

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
actually bows arm through here and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.150 
actually bows arm through here and
doctor<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.770> check<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.580> see<00:01:50.410> well<00:01:51.410> this

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
doctor here and check to see well this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.680 
doctor here and check to see well this
home<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.610> probably<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.119> not<00:01:53.420> big<00:01:53.660> enough

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
home is probably it is not big enough

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.560 
home is probably it is not big enough
because<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.800> just<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:55.729> tiny<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.390> arm

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
because it's just this tiny in this arm

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.590 
because it's just this tiny in this arm
is<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:56.960> why<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.009> essentially<00:01:58.700> how<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.390> on

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
is this why so essentially how I make on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.330 
is this why so essentially how I make on
us<00:01:59.780> so<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.259> takes<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.590> lot<00:02:00.740> longer<00:02:00.860> than<00:02:01.160> that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
us so it takes a lot longer than that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.430 
us so it takes a lot longer than that
but<00:02:01.400> I<00:02:01.910> don't<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.479> much<00:02:02.630> time<00:02:02.810> on<00:02:03.080> my<00:02:03.110> camera

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
but I don't have much time on my camera

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.050 
but I don't have much time on my camera
don't<00:02:03.650> waste<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.950> battery<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.610> therefore

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
don't waste the battery so therefore

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.640 
don't waste the battery so therefore
that<00:02:05.509> is<00:02:05.570> essentially<00:02:06.110> if<00:02:06.200> how<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.350> make

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
that is essentially if how you make

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.300 
that is essentially if how you make
Hillary<00:02:07.280> figure<00:02:08.209> clothing<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:10.160> how

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
Hillary figure clothing and this is how

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.430 
Hillary figure clothing and this is how
it<00:02:10.580> should<00:02:10.730> look<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:11.000> little<00:02:11.150> stuff<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:12.320> this

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
it should look a little stuff in this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
it should look a little stuff in this
case<00:02:12.709> may<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:13.310> your<00:02:13.610> edge<00:02:13.820> figure<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.510> out

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
case may be on your edge figure it out

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.699 
case may be on your edge figure it out
figure<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:15.980> looks<00:02:16.190> understand
