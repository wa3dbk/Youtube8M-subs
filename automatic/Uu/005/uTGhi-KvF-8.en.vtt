00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 your skin produce strong toxins 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.690
 a simple fact looks at it is tearing up the consume this sense already very 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.099
 sick but I would try again clark of great for the species in Lima 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.059
 bad luck for the individual entered the pp misses in two 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.850
 opportunities 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.760
 its bright color is a warning to others that during they are toxic 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 but like any warning if you do not pay private attention consequences 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.260
 the sea anemones are also poisonous but of course it is deadly for 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 humans these invertebrates with more taxes 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.880
 live in temperate coastal waters that all the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.950
 during the shock before the authors 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 and that firmly hold objects like rocks 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.030
 but they can move 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.690
 concretely in quito 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.240
 if necessary 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.880
 although the sea anemones can look very different from each other 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.600
 what they have in common with tentacles with the 2011 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.760
 called with the morning 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 when one of the cells disturbed shows 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.479
 the cylindrical tubes that have no means that correspond 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.880
 a minimum amount of terms to arrive 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 the astute itself a dose of poison like Benghazi to capture a month 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.080
 it's interesting that we have here what we would call a friend in the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.790
 ocean 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.300
 the clown fish 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.060
 st stimulates the cells of minus two of the anemones and cusco 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.130
 immunity depending on the case of the rejoicing of other animals 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.840
 the union a type of mongoose that lives in the colonies of south africa 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 I'm very aware 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 figures 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 and scorpions 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.520
 they look for fences and other great technicians are able to eat poisonous seeds 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.810
 in the jungle without having ill effects 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.170
 this statistic know the style 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.630
 physical in certain events where he used his powerful picks to tear chunks 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.110
 of rocks that contain medicinal minerals such as cahuín 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.579
 that neutralizes the poisons that they passed 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 in the animal kingdom the poison can be an experience 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.149
 the prerogatives of a hunter 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 A lifestyle 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.279
 Not all animals or even most have access to the document 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.279
 many predators and legitimize other elements to ensure food 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.079
 enough to survive

 bursts of speed to those who title mind no hurry to escape 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.869
 the lions like any girl 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.229
 they have large clients of hunters 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 but not having the riding speed they must catch unwary 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.709
 this affects the lions an advantage 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.709
 the wolves processing in groups called javier 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.079
 like African wild dogs 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.609
 although lone hunters like the puma 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.889
 the Siberian tiger 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.019
 the Panther 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.169
 they are very common 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.549
 all these predators have changes 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.769
 eyes in front 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.459
 in the hunter's teeth that is required 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.979
 but he replied they have their own ways to survive the persecution of 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:25.559
 footwear 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.019
 stay grouped after healing you will see the light of the next day 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.279
 in herds 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.959
 eyelid 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.859
 in colonies of animals that live together and that we would call family 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.909
 a whole society of meerkats is centered around safety 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.959
 full-time digital guards 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.739
 while others wait their turn to watch 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.479
 or maybe just enjoy a free afternoon 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.479
 the mole rats Sudan for living in the colony 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.539
 while the high and group fever to uncontrolled squeeze 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.229
 with its black and white faults 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.229
 it's hard to say where a zebra starts 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.249
 turret is hard to say 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.509
 before the sea beira and acts 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.179
 here some tenor live months or eaters of plants that are not 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.109
 threatened by predators crime by man I do not know I do not know I do not know 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.590
 the elephants

 tusk shore 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 oo but thanks to man these animals are in danger 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.330
 to which smata was not compensated for by its horns 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 to the elephants for their fangs or for fun 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.650
 and in the corridors for his house 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.090
 when we talk about the decree to survive 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.310
 I am a human being this means there is no rotation in the world that can 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.479
 protect them 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.849
 what is the greatest secret to survive in the animal kingdom 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.949
 maybe the camouflage 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.949
 the charitable classes for the provider and for the press 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.619
 the African lion with its toasted coat almost disappear African savannas 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.409
 as well as the cougar in the secret of North America 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.169
 while the color of the prairie dog allows it to survive in its 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.169
 world with his invisibility cloak 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.019
 Peter customers have managed to mix wherever they live 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.839
 as well as many practices like the chameleon 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.860
 and the one that cocos la rioja 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.360
 torture have also been mixed with the coloration of the ponds where 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.900
 they inhabit 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.960
 According to him, the most attractive map library is difficult to locate in the waters of its 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.909
 act as 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.199
 the spots allow an animal that seems not to want the theaters 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.650
 As a writer 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.240
 or the leopard 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.229
 or the giraffe of course 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.599
 and the faults of a tiger in the vegetation where he lives 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.759
 they will serve you for the same 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.689
 when we return to the animal kingdom 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.710
 we discovered more concrete
