00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and climbing up and don't worry about

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
and climbing up and don't worry about
picking<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.840> downstrokes<00:00:52.289> right

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
picking just use all downstrokes right

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
picking just use all downstrokes right
now<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.789> advanced<00:00:54.210> technique<00:00:54.239> later

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
now in a more advanced technique later

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
now in a more advanced technique later
then<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.890> alternating<00:00:56.370> picking<00:00:56.610> or

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
then we can use alternating picking or

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
then we can use alternating picking or
all<00:00:57.210> obstructs<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
all obstructs but for now we're just

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
all obstructs but for now we're just
going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.399> down<00:00:59.699> strokes<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> playing<00:01:01.620> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
going to do down strokes so playing on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.280 
going to do down strokes so playing on
the<00:01:01.829> fret<00:01:03.320> we're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> sound

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
between the wire frets you'll be good so

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.030

then we're going to put our middle
finger<00:01:32.420> on<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.659> fret<00:01:33.170> right<00:01:33.770> above<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
finger on the fret right above it on the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.890 

a<00:01:45.070> good<00:01:46.070> way<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:46.670> you're<00:01:46.880> moving<00:01:47.299> up<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:47.750> your

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
a good way when you're moving up on your

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.260 
a good way when you're moving up on your
frets<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.710> actually<00:01:49.100> don't<00:01:49.400> have<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> lift<00:01:50.060> up

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
frets you actually don't have to lift up

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.320 
frets you actually don't have to lift up
whatever<00:01:51.140> fret<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.070> below<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.640> because<00:01:52.850> the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
whatever fret it is below it because the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.510 
whatever fret it is below it because the
guitar<00:01:53.450> actually<00:01:54.080> plays<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.619> closest<00:01:55.220> to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
guitar actually plays the closest to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.109 
guitar actually plays the closest to
your<00:01:55.610> picking<00:01:55.970> hand<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.350> play<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.119> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
your picking hand so if I play this and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.350 
your picking hand so if I play this and
I<00:01:59.180> wear<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.479> pick<00:01:59.630> up<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.850> actually<00:02:02.180> just
