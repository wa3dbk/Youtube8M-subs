00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.220
Have you ever tried to spike the ball in volleyball?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.880
Or swing a golfclub?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.159
It's hard at first.

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.820
But the more you practice, the better you'll get.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.780
Professional athletes spend a lot of time practicing,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.490
but sometimes, adding a little bit of science

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.340
can really help them out.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.900
USC professor, Jill Mcnitt-Gray,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
uses physics to help athletes to be their best.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.994
She studies the biomechanics of movements

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:35.307
to find the body positions that lead to quick turns and high jumps.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.000
When we talk about biomechanics, we're really trying to figure out

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.140
what are the forces involved in causing the movement that you see.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.549
There are internal forces,

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.100
like those caused by muscles contracting and pulling on bones.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.953
And there are external forces.

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.304
Like, those between our bodies and the ground.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.900
When we push on the ground,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
it pushes back on us.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.340
This is called the "reaction force"

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700
and it plays a role in causing motion.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.260
And because we live on Earth,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.600
we also experience the force of gravity,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.225
which we know as body weight.

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.330
In biomechanics, we study all of that.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.942
We understand how muscles are coordinated

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:11.324
to generate reaction forces at the ground.

00:01:11.324 --> 00:01:14.700
We also understand how we have to overcome the effects of gravity.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.440
Biomechanics is all around you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.840
and part of it is just watching people move

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.680
and try to take on challenges and it can be everyday tasks

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
or it could be lead athletes doing long jump.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.737
Jill works with such athletes to improve their performance.

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:32.640
She films them at practice and then analyzes the video, frame by frame,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.905
to understand how the athletes are interacting with the ground

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:37.620
and generating motion.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.940
At USC, the gym also has force plates,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.876
which allowed Jill to measure the forces from the ground.

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:45.900
When your feet touch the ground and they push,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.700
we get a force acting on them,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800
and we're able to use the force plate information

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.455
to actually visualize what those forces are.

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:54.100
So as they push on the ground, we can see

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.280
those forces acting on their body.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.360
And, sometimes, if they're trying to jump high, for example,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.620
we want to have a lot of area underneath

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.380
that vertical force time curve and it'll be like a hump.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.300
But if you can get that area underneath to be even bigger,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.700
that means they're able to convert from zero velocity

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.430
to a bigger vertical velocity.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.941
More vertical velocity, more time in the air and the higher they jump.

00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.632
Velocity describes how fast an object is moving

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.480
in a specific direction.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.938
If you want a long air time when you jump,

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.412
you need to have a large vertical velocity,

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.020
created by pushing off the ground with a strong upward force.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.235
If you only get a little bit of vertical,

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.208
it would just be a little bit of time in the air.

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.860
But if you get a lot of vertical, you get a lot of time in the air

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.089
and that lets an athlete do a lot of things.

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.729
They can get into position to block.

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:39.940
They can do a jump shot.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
They can go above their defender to make the shot.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.860
Those kind of things and so,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.819
we really look to figure out ways that they

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.381
can generate more force in the ground,

00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:49.380
even if it's a short period of time,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.821
so they can get that vertical velocity at takeoff.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.600
By changing how the athletes use their leg muscles

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240
to push off the ground,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.925
they can make greater forces and higher jumps.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.445
In the gym, what's really cool is,

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.029
because we have force plates in the gym,

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.989
we can actually show them what those force time curves look like

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.900
and they can go back and try again.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.340
And so, if they want to make it bigger, they can experiment

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.340
and see, oh, if I push this way or that way

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.060
or if I'm in a different body position,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.755
what works for me to get that vertical velocity?

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:19.200
And that's very cool, because then, they

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.260
they learn about their own body, they also learn about physics.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.700
And then try to learn how the two things can work together

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.560
to get their performance better.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.520
Motions have many parts

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.263
and part of what Jill does, involves breaking down

00:03:32.263 --> 00:03:33.963
each movement for analysis

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.540
using 3D computer models.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.200
These models let her study how athletes, like volleyball players,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.320
have to move horizontally to get into position

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.612
before moving vertically to jump and block a shot.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.100
The key part, is the transition from

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.400
horizontal to vertical motion

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.048
or making your body stop moving side to side

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:55.680
and start moving up.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.000
For volleyball players, this is really important.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.873
If they're going to block a ball over the net,

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.093
they need to get up first, so that they can create that

00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:06.554
ceiling and make it hard for that hitter to get the ball over the net.

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:09.380
So, getting a good vertical jump is really important.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.991
Now they're not just standing by the net.

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.100
Often times, they have to move to where the hitters going to be

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.087
and then do the jump.

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:18.180
So we have to work on working with their horizontal speed

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.660
and their conversion to vertical to make that happen.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.934
Jill talks about she was always passionate about sports

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:26.220
and how she takes this passion as inspiration,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.080
for a deep understanding of the physics behind our movements.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.179
When you're doing athletics,

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:33.947
it's almost like you're practicing physics on a daily basis

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:35.620
to try to improve performance

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.917
and try to figure out, well, what is it that I can do

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.360
or what is it that I can do to help my teammate

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.069
perform better on the field.

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.402
You don't really realize it to start with,

00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:47.580
but as you experiment and get better and with good coaching,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.140
you can kind of figure out how things work and so,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.890
I think by being an athlete,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.260
you get to king of test things out, the laws of physics for real,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.540
with your own body and it's very cool, because you kind of...

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.992
everyday you go to practice and you try something new

00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:03.952
and you're pretty systematic and

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.380
you can kind of figure out, oh that's how that works

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.787
and then you're successful at doing it and that makes it all more fun.

00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:13.183
