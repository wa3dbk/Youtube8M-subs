times<00:01:58.759> basically<00:01:59.720> what<00:02:00.020> that's<00:02:00.200> trying<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.650> do

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
times basically what that's trying to do

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.530 
times basically what that's trying to do
is<00:02:01.610> allow<00:02:02.270> me<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.840> push<00:02:03.110> harder<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.700> longer<00:02:04.909> so

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
is allow me to push harder for longer so

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.539 
is allow me to push harder for longer so
I<00:02:05.570> feel<00:02:05.720> like<00:02:05.900> I'm<00:02:06.049> breathing<00:02:06.200> hard<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:07.400> not

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
I feel like I'm breathing hard but not

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.389 
I feel like I'm breathing hard but not
too<00:02:08.060> bad<00:02:08.239> first<00:02:08.929> portion<00:02:09.380> which<00:02:09.500> was<00:02:09.979> very

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
too bad first portion which was very

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.729 
too bad first portion which was very
basic<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:11.209> terms<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.630> been<00:02:11.840> three<00:02:12.140> minutes<00:02:12.290> of

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
basic in terms of been three minutes of

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.270 
basic in terms of been three minutes of
work<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.820> we<00:02:14.810> did<00:02:14.989> two<00:02:15.230> minutes<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.799> recovery

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
work and we did two minutes of recovery

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.060 
work and we did two minutes of recovery
35<00:02:17.030> seconds<00:02:17.510> next<00:02:17.930> week<00:02:18.200> I'd<00:02:18.350> like<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:18.860> him

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
35 seconds next week I'd like to see him

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.699 
35 seconds next week I'd like to see him
progress<00:02:19.579> to<00:02:19.940> five<00:02:20.150> minutes<00:02:20.570> then<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.959> 7<00:02:21.230> into

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
progress to five minutes then to 7 into

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.300 
progress to five minutes then to 7 into
10<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:21.980> 15<00:02:22.900> generally<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.049> equation<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.769> half

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
10 and 15 generally the equation is half

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.900 
10 and 15 generally the equation is half
rest<00:02:25.910> versus<00:02:26.900> your<00:02:27.049> work<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.430> kind<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.730> gives

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
rest versus your work it kind of gives

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.840 
rest versus your work it kind of gives
me<00:02:29.060> an<00:02:29.720> idea<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.829> exertion<00:02:31.489> level<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.790> need

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
me an idea of the exertion level I need

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.110 
me an idea of the exertion level I need
I<00:02:32.180> feel<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.900> could<00:02:33.500> have<00:02:33.590> kept<00:02:33.769> going<00:02:34.120> but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
I feel like I could have kept going but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.340 
I feel like I could have kept going but
those<00:02:35.420> three<00:02:35.660> minute<00:02:35.840> intervals<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.230> was

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
those three minute intervals I was

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.259 
those three minute intervals I was
always<00:02:36.500> happy<00:02:36.739> when<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.130> were<00:02:37.250> saying<00:02:37.489> 10

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
always happy when you were saying 10

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.240 
always happy when you were saying 10
seconds<00:02:38.630> left<00:02:38.780> yeah<00:02:39.170> I'm<00:02:39.500> pushing<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.070> 5

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
seconds left yeah I'm pushing it to 5

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.640 
seconds left yeah I'm pushing it to 5
minutes<00:02:40.519> might<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.880> about<00:02:41.690> right<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.230> beyond

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
minutes might be about right but beyond

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.590 
minutes might be about right but beyond
that<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:42.980> probably<00:02:43.190> gonna<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.209> really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that it's probably gonna be really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.720 
that it's probably gonna be really
pushing<00:02:44.959> where<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> am<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.280> what<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.489> find

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
pushing where I am and what you find

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.900 
pushing where I am and what you find
over<00:02:46.850> time<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:49.190> don't<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.549> try

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
over time is you don't have to try

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.479 
over time is you don't have to try
harder<00:02:50.350> you'll<00:02:51.350> end<00:02:51.590> up<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.980> clicking<00:02:52.280> down

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
harder you'll end up just clicking down

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.069 
harder you'll end up just clicking down
a<00:02:52.519> bigger<00:02:52.790> gear<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.180> next<00:02:53.420> week<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.870> their

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
a bigger gear the next week and their

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.660 
a bigger gear the next week and their
bigger<00:02:54.290> gear<00:02:54.560> again<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.400> realize

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
bigger gear again and then you realize

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.009 
bigger gear again and then you realize
hey<00:02:55.820> I'm<00:02:55.880> getting<00:02:56.120> stronger<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.540> stronger<00:02:56.780> my

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
hey I'm getting stronger and stronger my

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.500 
hey I'm getting stronger and stronger my
heart<00:02:57.230> rate<00:02:57.380> staying<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.769> same<00:02:57.799> so<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:59.390> I'd

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
heart rate staying the same so what I'd

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.970 
heart rate staying the same so what I'd
like<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> do<00:02:59.840> now<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.019> continue<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.799> hill

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
like to do now is continue up the hill

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.960 
like to do now is continue up the hill
but<00:03:01.130> we<00:03:01.250> want<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.489> change<00:03:01.700> our<00:03:01.820> emphasis

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
but we want to change our emphasis

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.020 
but we want to change our emphasis
Kalin's<00:03:02.930> now<00:03:03.110> 85<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.739> 90<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.220> let's<00:03:05.030> do<00:03:05.359> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
Kalin's now 85 to 90 and let's do a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.020 
Kalin's now 85 to 90 and let's do a
efforts<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.900> 4-minute<00:03:07.319> recoveries<00:03:07.740> and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
efforts with 4-minute recoveries and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.449 
efforts with 4-minute recoveries and
this<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.240> an<00:03:09.360> intensity<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:10.860> above<00:03:11.190> race

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
this is an intensity just above race

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.940 
this is an intensity just above race
pace<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.360> cadence<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> trace<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.319> my

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
pace so the cadence you trace that my

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.830 
pace so the cadence you trace that my
probably<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.490> harder<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.510> second

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
probably a little harder the second

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.199 
probably a little harder the second
session<00:03:16.050> was<00:03:16.410> trying<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> relate<00:03:17.760> more<00:03:18.030> to

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
session was trying to relate more to

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.690 
session was trying to relate more to
race<00:03:18.390> scenario<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.170> which<00:03:20.040> one<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.400> there<00:03:20.580> is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
race scenario and which one do there is

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
race scenario and which one do there is
get<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> cadence<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.990> pedal<00:03:22.380> motion<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
get the cadence or that pedal motion the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.350 
get the cadence or that pedal motion the
same<00:03:23.220> as<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.550> try<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.209> race

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
same as what you try to do in a race

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.640 
same as what you try to do in a race
situation<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.959> max<00:03:28.230> your<00:03:28.440> own<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.560> have

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
situation have you max your own you have

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.800 
situation have you max your own you have
your<00:03:28.770> threshold<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:30.180> goal<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.600> training

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
your threshold here the goal of training

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.860 
your threshold here the goal of training
is<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.319> keep<00:03:31.440> edging<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:31.980> up<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.300> go<00:03:33.420> at

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
is to keep edging this up so you go at

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.420 
is to keep edging this up so you go at
the<00:03:33.989> start<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.410> program<00:03:34.770> you're

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the start of your program you're

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.780 
the start of your program you're
operating<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:36.110> 65%<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.170> your<00:03:37.230> max<00:03:37.790> you're

operating at 65% of your max you're

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.030 
operating at 65% of your max you're
hoping<00:03:39.090> by<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.269> end<00:03:39.390> you're<00:03:40.380> operating<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.860> 80

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
hoping by the end you're operating at 80

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.620 
hoping by the end you're operating at 80
to<00:03:41.160> 90<00:03:41.459> percent<00:03:42.620> second<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:43.739> feels<00:03:43.950> good

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
to 90 percent second one feels good

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.080 
to 90 percent second one feels good
taking<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.690> third<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:47.040> good<00:03:47.220> thing<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.489> it's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
taking the third the good thing is it's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.699 
taking the third the good thing is it's
