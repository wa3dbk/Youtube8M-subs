but<00:00:51.570> remember<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> mega<00:00:52.289> evolution<00:00:52.800> doesn't

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but remember that mega evolution doesn't

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
but remember that mega evolution doesn't
really<00:00:53.219> change<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.610> Pokemon<00:00:54.000> too<00:00:54.360> much<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.170> I

is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> its<00:01:17.400> stats<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.820> boosted<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
is that all of its stats get boosted we

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.240 
is that all of its stats get boosted we
also<00:01:19.320> received<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> new<00:01:20.220> information

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
also received a lot of new information

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.940 
also received a lot of new information
on<00:01:20.820> primal<00:01:21.210> Groudon<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.659> primal<00:01:21.990> Kyogre<00:01:22.439> let's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
on primal Groudon in primal Kyogre let's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.340 
on primal Groudon in primal Kyogre let's
start<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.220> groudon<00:01:23.689> primal<00:01:24.689> Groudon<00:01:25.049> gets<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
start with groudon primal Groudon gets a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
start with groudon primal Groudon gets a
new<00:01:25.470> ability<00:01:25.680> called<00:01:26.070> final<00:01:26.369> earth<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
new ability called final earth it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
new ability called final earth it
apparently<00:01:27.659> activates<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.890> strong

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
apparently activates really strong

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
apparently activates really strong
sunlight<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:30.180> guess<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
sunlight my guess is that it's like a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.620 
sunlight my guess is that it's like a
stronger<00:01:31.740> sunny<00:01:32.040> day<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.610> maybe<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> longer

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
stronger sunny day or maybe a longer

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
stronger sunny day or maybe a longer

gets a new attack called cliff sword I
think<00:01:38.100> we've<00:01:38.220> seen<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.549> attack<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
think we've seen this attack in a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
think we've seen this attack in a
previous<00:01:39.299> gameplay<00:01:39.840> trailer<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.409> not

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
previous gameplay trailer but I'm not

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
previous gameplay trailer but I'm not
completely<00:01:41.159> sure<00:01:41.600> primal<00:01:42.600> Kyogre<00:01:43.020> gets<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> new

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
completely sure primal Kyogre gets a new

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
completely sure primal Kyogre gets a new
ability<00:01:43.560> called<00:01:43.950> beginning<00:01:44.399> ocean<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.360> sort

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
ability called beginning ocean it's sort

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
ability called beginning ocean it's sort
of<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.990> opposite<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> primal<00:01:46.799> Groudon

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of like the opposite of primal Groudon

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
of like the opposite of primal Groudon
sibility<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> activates<00:01:48.479> strong

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
sibility because it activates strong

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
sibility because it activates strong
rain<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.799> guess<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> stronger

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
rain so my guess is that it's a stronger

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
rain so my guess is that it's a stronger
drizzle<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> longer-lasting<00:01:52.079> drizzle

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
drizzle or a longer-lasting drizzle

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
drizzle or a longer-lasting drizzle

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
whatever it has apparently you start

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.220 
whatever it has apparently you start
with<00:02:41.610> grovyle<00:02:42.000> Combusken<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.659> Marshtomp<00:02:43.110> in

with grovyle Combusken or Marshtomp in
the<00:02:43.319> demos<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.159> I'm<00:02:44.280> guessing<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> little

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the demos so I'm guessing it's a little

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.430 
deal with them I'm not completely sure
about<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.970> hopefully<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:04.019> anyway

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
about that hopefully we see it anyway

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.319 
about that hopefully we see it anyway
but<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.340> guess<00:03:05.670> we'll<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:05.849> have<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.120> wait<00:03:06.269> and

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
but I guess we'll just have to wait and

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.630 
but I guess we'll just have to wait and
see<00:03:06.510> oh<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.590> i<00:03:07.680> forgot<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:08.010> mention<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.489> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
