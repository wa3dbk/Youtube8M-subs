 actresses the killers 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.080

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.150
 'fantastic four' already begin to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.809
 sprout where we have rumors surely 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.809
 of the other characters 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.210
 the many villains that will come and who 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.670
 certainly do not look much or better 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 said we are worth nothing at the rate that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.530
 we know about comics and series 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.870
 let's hope that that by computer 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.420
 change a lot of things because it is 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.160
 happening the same with the electro anthony 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.740
 mackie that we can see him in brigade 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.930
 elite or pure steel 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.540
 is a new character of captain america 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.940
 two 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.880
 in any character of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.100
 is a superhero is alcohol 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 also known as a falcon that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 it seems that according to its director the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.909
 movie captain america 2 was like 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.740
 'the avengers' 1.5 and here the test 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.100
 other superiors that joins the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.750
 list of the black life of my fury of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.799
 I stop alcohol and now also the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 alcohol will be a movie that alone 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.770
 for the cast is promising enough 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.619
 and here we have an image of the shooting in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.359
 the one we can see anthony mackie 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.219
 already in the character and in a chroma 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.960
 obviously, as always, everything 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.729
 others see they are full of computer 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.050
 he also left us another image of 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.660
 concept of guardians of the galaxy 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.180
 the one that does not know much more than a light 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.390
 what looks like a ship may not be 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.040
 very clear but of course marvel 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.390
 This is the one I most expect of all 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.870
 what is that way in space with 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.870
 extraterrestrial 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.170
 a visual section that will surely be 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.150
 awesome for the news the cinema 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.150
