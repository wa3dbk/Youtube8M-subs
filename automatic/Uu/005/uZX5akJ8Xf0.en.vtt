00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
years I've been here this team is the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.270 
years I've been here this team is the
most<00:01:22.910> cohesive<00:01:23.180> team<00:01:23.420> I've<00:01:23.660> been<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.280> outside

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
most cohesive team I've been and outside

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.250 
most cohesive team I've been and outside
the<00:01:25.400> best<00:01:25.550> why<00:01:25.700> we<00:01:25.850> all<00:01:26.000> hang<00:01:26.240> out<00:01:26.360> together<00:01:26.540> a

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
the best why we all hang out together a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.410 
the best why we all hang out together a
little<00:01:27.800> bit<00:01:27.890> David<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:28.280> Kelly<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:29.240> all

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
little bit David and Kelly so we all

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.639 
little bit David and Kelly so we all
like<00:01:29.570> come<00:01:29.750> over<00:01:29.810> there<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.200> like<00:01:30.290> watch

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
like come over there and like watch

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.070 
like come over there and like watch
stuff<00:01:33.649> like<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.009> play<00:01:34.130> video<00:01:34.250> games<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:38.080> I

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
stuff like that play video games so I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.320 
stuff like that play video games so I
think<00:01:39.200> we've<00:01:39.800> gotten<00:01:40.040> really<00:01:40.160> close<00:01:40.250> over<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
think we've gotten really close over the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.660 
think we've gotten really close over the
past<00:01:41.540> couple<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.869> years<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.619> think<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.070> we

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
past couple of years and I think that we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.280 
past couple of years and I think that we
have<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> team<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.180> everyone's<00:01:44.869> in<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.110> for

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
have a team that everyone's in it for

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.200 
have a team that everyone's in it for
the<00:01:45.350> team<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.830> everyone<00:01:46.520> here<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.940> team

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the team so everyone here is a team

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.480 
the team so everyone here is a team
first<00:01:47.420> person<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.560> team<00:01:48.770> first<00:01:48.979> guy<00:01:49.220> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
first person and the team first guy and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.920 
first person and the team first guy and
I<00:01:49.610> think<00:01:49.670> everyone<00:01:50.180> wants<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.450> win<00:01:50.630> more<00:01:50.869> than

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
I think everyone wants to win more than

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.230 
I think everyone wants to win more than
anything<00:01:51.200> else<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:54.649> it's<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.190> lot<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.790> teams<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
anything else so it's a lot of teams I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.040 
anything else so it's a lot of teams I
think<00:01:56.270> talk<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.200> talk<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:58.520> one<00:01:58.820> walks<00:01:59.780> it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
think talk the talk this one walks it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.410 
think talk the talk this one walks it
and<00:02:00.410> lives<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.390> I

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and lives it and that that's what I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.060 
and lives it and that that's what I
think<00:02:02.690> makes<00:02:02.720> him<00:02:03.080> unique<00:02:03.409> well<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.860> think

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
think makes him unique well I think

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.890 
think makes him unique well I think
