the recruitment process of Deloitte had
three<00:00:05.430> rounds<00:00:05.819> first<00:00:06.480> was<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.899> oscillating

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
three rounds first was the oscillating

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.490 
three rounds first was the oscillating
round<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.730> students<00:00:09.030> around<00:00:09.690> students<00:00:10.350> was

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
round the students around students was

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.769 
round the students around students was
selected<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.039> the<00:00:11.100> basis<00:00:11.459> of<00:00:11.549> cgpa<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.389> CHP

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:12.779 
selected on the basis of cgpa the CHP

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.560 
selected on the basis of cgpa the CHP
criteria<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.379> six<00:00:13.590> point<00:00:13.770> five<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.250> guess<00:00:14.570> they

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
criteria was six point five I guess they

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.230 
criteria was six point five I guess they
were<00:00:15.629> uh<00:00:15.750> twenty<00:00:16.470> questions<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.520> sample<00:00:17.970> from

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
were uh twenty questions so sample from

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880 
were uh twenty questions so sample from
were<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:18.900> mathematics<00:00:19.439> sample<00:00:19.800> from

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
were from mathematics sample from

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.829 
were from mathematics sample from
English<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.460> logical<00:00:21.029> reasoning<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.419> also

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
English and logical reasoning was also

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.079

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
they basically divided us into groups of

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.630 
they basically divided us into groups of
six<00:00:42.270> wouldn't<00:00:42.570> each<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.740> gave<00:00:43.890> each

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
six wouldn't each then they gave each

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.300 
six wouldn't each then they gave each
group<00:00:45.060> was<00:00:45.210> given<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.510> case<00:00:45.630> study<00:00:45.980> at<00:00:46.980> least

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
group was given a case study at least

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.920 
group was given a case study at least
and<00:00:47.490> he<00:00:47.580> was<00:00:47.760> based<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.330> fertilizer<00:00:48.780> company

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and he was based on a fertilizer company

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.830 
and he was based on a fertilizer company
there<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:50.130> no<00:00:50.340> identity<00:00:51.060> process<00:00:51.240> going<00:00:51.690> on

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
there was no identity process going on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
there was no identity process going on
in<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.740> company<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.490> they<00:00:54.330> gave<00:00:54.480> us

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in that in that company so they gave us

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
in that in that company so they gave us
some<00:00:54.810> statistics<00:00:55.380> based<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.130> which<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.640> had<00:00:56.790> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
some statistics based on which we had to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
some statistics based on which we had to
discard<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> decide<00:00:58.050> how<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.710> work

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
discard we have to decide how the work

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
discard we have to decide how the work
should<00:00:59.130> be<00:00:59.400> carried<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.810> company

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
should be carried on so that the company

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.800 
should be carried on so that the company
makes<00:01:01.320> profit<00:01:01.740> so<00:01:02.220> we<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.180> given<00:01:03.390> we've<00:01:03.660> also

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
makes profit so we are given we've also

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.370 
makes profit so we are given we've also
given<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.290> chart<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.339> had<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> write<00:01:05.759> all

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
given a chart and we had to write all

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
given a chart and we had to write all
the<00:01:07.380> conclusion<00:01:07.859> able<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> inclusion<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the conclusion able to inclusion on that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
the conclusion able to inclusion on that
chart<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.259> we<00:01:10.439> had<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.679> present<00:01:10.859> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
chart and then we had to present it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.959 
chart and then we had to present it
before<00:01:11.490> 10<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:14.130> give<00:01:14.670> us<00:01:14.789> not

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
before 10 so it would they give us not

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.209 
before 10 so it would they give us not
five<00:01:15.210> minutes<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.979> about<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> case

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
five minutes to think about the case

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.880 
five minutes to think about the case
study<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:17.999> give<00:01:18.450> us<00:01:18.600> five<00:01:19.319> minutes<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
study then they give us five minutes to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.849 
study then they give us five minutes to
discuss<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.999> amongst<00:01:21.329> ourselves<00:01:21.710> during<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
discuss it amongst ourselves during that

would<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.819> Heidi<00:02:31.090> about<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.930> programming

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
would much Heidi about the programming

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.470 
would much Heidi about the programming
languages<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.250> answered<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.300> have

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.630 
languages so I answered that I just have
some<00:02:34.690> basic<00:02:34.989> idea<00:02:35.260> about<00:02:35.290> C<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.800> C++<00:02:35.980> which<00:02:36.550> I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
some basic idea about C and C++ which I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.119 
some basic idea about C and C++ which I
started<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:37.090> my<00:02:37.239> first<00:02:37.569> term<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.050> then<00:02:38.950> they

which<00:02:40.870> was<00:02:40.989> based<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.410> mathematical

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
which was based on mathematical

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.920 
which was based on mathematical
calculations<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.640> saw<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.599> they<00:02:43.720> will<00:02:43.840> have

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
calculations I saw and they will have

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.800 
calculations I saw and they will have
