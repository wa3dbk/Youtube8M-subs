the<00:05:44.250> same<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:44.820> is<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.390> heartbeat<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:46.140> rhythm

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
the same it is the heartbeat the rhythm

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:58.100 
the same it is the heartbeat the rhythm
and<00:05:46.890> we'd<00:05:47.550> start<00:05:47.910> together<00:05:48.450> on<00:05:56.900> we<00:05:57.900> call<00:05:58.080> it

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
and we'd start together on we call it

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.590 
and we'd start together on we call it
the<00:05:58.260> mammalian<00:05:58.650> journey<00:05:59.160> enjoy<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.330> it's<00:06:00.510> a
