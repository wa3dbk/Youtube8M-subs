00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 wonderful new animations so van Bommel 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 he had particularly strong fluctuating production as well as Richard Ross stores on 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.189
 Florian Gless just a few days ago Ribery lend samples under Convertible 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.570
 from the sale 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.590
 and I have the first two films in the run-up degree 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 And to have the whole then synonymous pretty good pictures is really fun 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.249
 Kaká 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.869
 we do not have his first time up there is more of a kind like men just 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.499
 only new excitement 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.969
 but our reinterpretation of course exist millions of euros 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:52.339
 yearly 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.799
 the whole thing packed as an animation and it plays off to Rollo 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.189
 Fee without but where ever percent in a semi-detached house in the 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.460
 Rhein-herne-Kanal and a woman Carrie Underwood would like to be empty 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.420
 completely red and completely blue 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.920
 and have this choice rule leaving their house 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.900
 Behave these gardens, there is a real life all garden gnomes 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.340
 all figures made of clay 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.920
 or what does he still make recurrent lives of the others, too 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 in addition 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.510
 really existing figures brought to life okay 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.570
 as easy as we do not of course the problem would be that the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.680
 The blue dwarfs are as red as the blue ones 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.590
 and Celle I also happen to be in the Überlinger camp one for their 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.190
 Teachers and all members are up 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.910
 fall in love with each other and want people to do this 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.000
 can not be 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.079
 but in the end, of course, he somehow tries to get hurt 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.200
 on stage that is my claim »that is nothing new either man or 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.479
 heard again 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.090
 since I alleged my tragic stories or releases this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 Shakespeare and of course it will always be a vineyard in the world 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.509
 Literature stay 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.429
 Of course you ask yourself how do you get an animated film in the one 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.140
 Of course a happy ending awaits 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.680
 and the dramatic rights changes for ours well and has ca man 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.820
 Maybe Shakespeare was just a farmer in the past 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.539
 and I think that's very well heard the favorites must say 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.530
 they do not market a porch because 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 It is a lot of investing in order especially many gags those involved swiftly 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 A Porsche must burst otherwise only curious 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.129
 Job seekers four with direct conversation hilarious 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.150
 Although it has some figures omitted the female u are back but 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.999
 that's not so important this movie is entertaining and Roy animated 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.239
 So not only as you would otherwise know such a light animation many still 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.780
 in it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.619
 his cellphone is charging at this area 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.299

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.700
 Blame they are against being a scene he is not possible and it 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.190
 manages to actually get one so if you think you are already one 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.969
 I'm a bit sad too 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.110
 and created that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.239
 In which they make their association make it a trustee of great history 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.799
 Following the 80 cats repeated and why I'm so excited is that 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.470
 It may actually be narrow Panamera therefore on the court twice 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.720

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.760
 out of 10 possible points forward Sundern Rösler you can watch Kling 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.600
 Area up to which she did not know exactly what to expect 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.239
 and the more expensive it is in retrospect a very big recommendation 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.510
 a little more for sweets than they are once again thats not me anyway 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.439

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.040

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.880
 the food was critical it was said are funny tries the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.230
 People somehow dare because of the way too much or not at all what 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:27.809

 Solar values ​​under themselves 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.030
 and otherwise yes a very big stage 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.970

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.310
