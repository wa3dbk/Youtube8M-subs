00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.239
 in this kind of lesson I will tell you how 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.580
 to create 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.020
 such a collage 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.849
 i.e. combining two images 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 the original image was such 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.900
 here is some personality teaching 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.029
 standing budovsky 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.550
 on the Internet was found here 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.519
 western cape code 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.970
 let's start 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.499
 create a collage 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.460
 with the fact that yar not cooperate letters 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.720
 who are on the board 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.200
 others today do and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 taking advantage of the fact that 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.930
 surface danish 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.830
 fairly uniform 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.970
 I highlight 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.250
 this is the surface 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.790
 can be ordinary rectangular 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.380
 selection 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.249
 including copy mode 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.610
 select the object 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.190
 to do this, just press the combination 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.780
 kontron malta 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.120
 and in selection mode 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.510
 just move the fragment 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 to copy people 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.340
 but here I am quite rude 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.340
 smeared with unnecessary inscriptions 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.750
 there is a need to highlight this 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.950
 teachers 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 and transfer to adjacent images 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.460
 to highlight it is easiest 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 take advantage of one of his juice i 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.100
 prefer magnetic stripe 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 including mode 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.300
 exact cursor 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.270
 To do this, I press the kapslok 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.530
 on keyboard 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.060
 and the diameter of this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.720
 round 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.799
 an object 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.430
 and corresponds to 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.890
 that is, but no which will act 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.160
 tool 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 zooming in 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.330
 to make it easier to work 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.760
 and start about here from this point me 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.310
 need to highlight 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.399
 teachers just shouting once at 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.580
 border and moving 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 tool along objects 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.260
 now including tool 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
 move selected object 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.569
 and captured for military targets 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.019
 by tab 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.089
 neighboring 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.089
 I need it 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.120
 note 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.999
 if you turn on visibility 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.779
 palette of slovenia 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.969
 who do you see that there is a new layer 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.869
 layer 1 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.849
 which overlaps the background 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.159
 here selected cut objects 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.369
 has become 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.529
 previous image 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.519
 hours of work with this layer I changed it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.399
 dimensions and placed it on top 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:06.829
 imported teachers 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.709
 which 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.219
 this moment 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.659
 answering mode freely 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.430
 transformation is enough 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.769
 push kontrol china 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.379
 timothy on the keyboard 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.609
 we clamp 6 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.479
 and around the corner a limiter to 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.789
 try to anally resize 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.529
 reducing size 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.200
 something like that so he was 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.719
 to import some oil 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.550
 now right click ipo 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.339
 to the object 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.669
 but in free mode, it is not special 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:37.709
 reflected 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.919
 horizontally 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.179
 this person 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.519
 and try to place it 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.309
 into place 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.059
 a foreigner 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.129
 double click and complete and 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.409
 conversions 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.669
 I see that everything is so good only 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.609
 what the alien looks behind 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.199
 domestic teachers 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.429
 t to 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.949
 wipe it 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.649
 I'm in Rome on disabling visibility top 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.099
 layer 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.829
 with a Russian teacher and 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.519
 again in the same way that I 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.219
 already used 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.259
 SBU Komi 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.529
 on the board taking advantage of the fact that only 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:16.900
 what should a take into account 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.519
 must be active 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.529
 background layer 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.930
 that layer with which we will work 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.600
 I have now selected a rectangle 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.029
 clamp the contour 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.439
 and just 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.439
 cube drink 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.110
 up to this object 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.110
 moving to the right point 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.749
 now let's increase the brightness and 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.590
 contrast here this new personality 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.849
 domestic teachers 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.580
 the fact is that when shooting 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.280
 the camera apparently was not taken into account 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.189
 brightness of the room in which there was and 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.740
 so it turned out too dark 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.940
 compared to import mate 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.449
 to increase and brightness 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.449
 contrast 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.979
 First of all 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.960
 we derive 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.120
 its palette 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.729
 if suddenly she does not see that in the menu window you 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.509
 will find 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.550
 this position 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.050
 besides this it should be visible 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.990
 palette 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.120
 which is called in English 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.490
 Angie stop 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.159
 what is the translation like 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.449
 in Russian means ruble we need 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.459
 Rezun to brightness and contrast and 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.229
 ballet pictograms responsible for creating 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.330
 corresponding adjustment layer 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.279
 including this layer 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.879
 now the opportunity 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.060
 and all because of the test 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.960
 this new adjustment layer with 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680
 previous layer which is 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 right under it 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.580
 the point is that we need to adjust the brightness 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.970
 and contrast me the whole image in 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.289
 including chinese 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.159
 but only here from this layer where 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.279
 is domestic 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.319
 teacher 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.589
 to turn on 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.689
 this restriction serves this 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:03.960
 pictogram 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.939
 if described 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.150
 all changes 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.560
 brightness and contrast and will 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.509
 treat only not take lying ops 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.009
 one layer 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.150
 cry aeb 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.539
 and increasing the arc there 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.569
 right before your eyes increased and the brightness 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.240
 teacher 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 nb trust is 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.759
 well now the best 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.610
 let's make sure that appeared 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.610
 new corrective self 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.069
 it remains only with the brothers here this white 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:39.210
 to whom 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.249
 I switch again 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.360
 on your 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 contain this white feed 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.479
 in the layer menu 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.909
 find edge processing 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:54.830
 and there is 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.710
 eliminate to it 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.500
 however, you can make a choice right away 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.680
 remove white eagle 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.990
 on width 1 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.330
 pixel 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.119
 right before my eyes disappeared 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.599
 begins to write Russian text 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.119
 perhaps all creation of such 

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:13.649
 collages
