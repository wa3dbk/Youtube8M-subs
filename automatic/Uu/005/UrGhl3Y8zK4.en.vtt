00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.170

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.490
 independence we all know for 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.019

 of course we will work but we 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.630
 most likely its only engage 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.760
 beloved and work not because 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.940

 when pressed you need to learn and in the cockpit 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.850
 the easiest accumulation tool 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:02.260
 money that you and I know 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.470

 business strategy is rich than lies 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.830
 rich hour strategy 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.799
 first saves money from what he 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.759
 earned and then only spends what 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.729

 it's a 10 percent donation 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.659
 the number of pockets can be absolutely 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.399
 the only rule I already take to him 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.210
 just from the stern on which she is 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.270
 it is intended from this pocket already proc 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.250
 just a meal from this just learning 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.740

 new shoes just only $ 50 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.390
 the rest of our pockets caught us even 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 seventy five thousand dollars but we are 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.560
 we can not that we do great 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.590
 it turns out in this situation every 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.489
 empty pocket is a reason to make money 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.980

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.069
 here and over travel by donating and ready 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.230
 whether we would take and until then we took 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.329
 money there is nothing high there 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.410
 for only works in case divorce 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.790
 full absolute zero so here is the border 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.590
 make and pockets 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.170
 I ask you for the sake of Christ 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.920
 yes and go financial freedom so so 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.239
 nice when you enter the store 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 sells you trying to explain what it is 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.280
 expensive and thing off and proceed with that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.170
 i like this lake and so is it 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.310
 the pulse of freedom begins with the fact that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.019
 we start to control our expenses 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.209
 by the way who knows dear friends every 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.970

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.700
 raise your hands 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.390
 I will eat this is called we have a question 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.319
 why here's how to compare million glue 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.970
 I will count 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.459
 and when he will they when only 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.890
 the way to control begins to flow this 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.010
 count your money 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.870
 when I count my income, I know where it comes from 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.629
 come to me the most profitable money and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.459
 I can do this more if she 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.319
 where can my money go i can 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.870
 any channel overlap stop 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.569
 spends them there but i can only do it in 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.319
 including some information from 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.389
 comes and where is the information gone if 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.980
 I don't know where the money comes to me is not 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.549
 I know nothing more I can 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.680
 to change 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.220
 not because i lack imagination 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.160
 that but there is no willpower that there is no information 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.060
 so here is the accounting of all your money all your 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.230
 income of all 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.780
 costs just allows 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.420
 control sochi called as we know 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.340
 where it comes from and anywhere you can 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.859
 something to change but still dear friends one 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.440
 good news for today we 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.900
 with you said financial freedom is 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.270
 when your income exceeds our expenses 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.680
 you do not imagine anything 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.680
 imagine your arrival your distributor 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.030
 says is a sponsor I would be happy 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.910
 if I received $ 1000 a month 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.740
 doing nothing like that of course 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.889
 doing things you love but not for money 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.930
 or $ 1000 was enough for me 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.970
 probably a lot of people 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.700
 she would have warmed her soul for many years question a 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.419
 what you need to have capital to receive 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.250
 1000 dollars a month we do nothing 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.760
 the calculation is very simple if you 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.840
 increase your money in the bank under 12 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.510
 percent per annum 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.090
 you need to have a hundred thousand pay 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.979
 attention is not a million but only 100 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.490
 thousand average apartment in Moscow is 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.889
 more than one hundred thousand 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.949
 in the regional center luxury apartment 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.650
 worth 100,000 and if we own money 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.560
 offered me 12 percent per annum 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.599
 but by 24 percent a year by law 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.849
 have a sum of 50,000 fifty dollars 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.009
 thousand dollars is a studio 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.780
 apartment in Kiev whether anyone tax in Moscow 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:49.770
 they can offer not two by four 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.240
 percent per annum 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.210
 balanced investment background 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:01.960
 which brings 50 percent per annum 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:03.960
 work mind 25,000 dollars question how 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.789
 difficult to collect 25,000 dollars and 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.919
 also multiply by two tenths 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.139
 percent per annum 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.479
 two years maximum in order to 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.940
 receive 1000 dollars per month in total 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.490
 only two years to competently dispose 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.120
 first of all we donâ€™t need our money 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.250
 million 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.370
 secondly, the way most people waving 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:28.650
 freedom is much closer dear friends than 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.990
 we think and we are training the mountains 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.030
 money management is usually after 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.509
 training fit people say valentine 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.759
 how young are you why didn't you tell us 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.259
 then go back I already reached 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:45.099
 financial code and so 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.320
 so dear friends asked 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:50.500
 financial freedom in our hands 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.479
 in our country in the cis countries all this is already 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.210
 fortunately we really need 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:58.060
