hi i'm mike corliss from tormach and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.160 
hi i'm mike corliss from tormach and
today<00:00:16.619> I'm<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.950> to<00:00:17.070> use<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:18.360> dial<00:00:18.689> indicator

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
today I'm going to use a dial indicator

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
today I'm going to use a dial indicator
to<00:00:19.439> sweep<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> hole<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.700> X<00:00:20.910> Y<00:00:21.119> zero<00:00:21.420> on

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to sweep the hole for my X Y zero on

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.130 
to sweep the hole for my X Y zero on
this<00:00:21.779> part<00:00:22.220> here's<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.369> dial<00:00:23.640> indicator<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this part here's my dial indicator you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
this part here's my dial indicator you
know<00:00:26.060> swingarm<00:00:28.520> put<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> spindle

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
know swingarm put that in the spindle

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.390 
know swingarm put that in the spindle
and<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.539> I'll<00:00:30.720> sweep<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> hole

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.560 

Jack<00:00:40.400> it<00:00:40.580> over<00:00:42.100> part<00:00:43.100> roughly<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:43.730> bought<00:00:44.120> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
Jack it over part roughly I bought the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.630 
Jack it over part roughly I bought the
swing<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.080> indicator<00:00:45.560> with<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.100> top<00:00:46.460> of

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
swing of the indicator with the top of

00:00:46.640 --> 00:01:02.820 
swing of the indicator with the top of
the<00:00:46.700> bowl<00:01:00.250> I'm<00:01:01.250> just<00:01:01.550> eyeballing<00:01:01.699> up<00:01:02.239> the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
the bowl I'm just eyeballing up the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.160 
the bowl I'm just eyeballing up the
indicator<00:01:03.830> swing<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:04.489> us<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.630> sides<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.080> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
indicator swing with us the sides of the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.750 
indicator swing with us the sides of the
hold<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.560> trying<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.920> get<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.160> fairly<00:01:07.430> close

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
hold is trying to get it fairly close

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.340 
hold is trying to get it fairly close
before<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> stick<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.540> indicator<00:01:08.960> down<00:01:09.170> in

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
before I stick to indicator down in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:33.330 
before I stick to indicator down in
there<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:11.570> doesn't<00:01:11.930> look<00:01:11.990> too<00:01:12.170> bad

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.249 

when<00:01:33.939> I<00:01:33.970> started<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.630> pre-loaded<00:01:35.170> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
when I started I pre-loaded the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.780 
when I started I pre-loaded the
indicator<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.770> little<00:01:36.009> bit<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.430> get<00:01:36.640> us

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
indicator a little bit just to get us

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.929 
indicator a little bit just to get us
just<00:01:37.509> adjust<00:01:37.899> for<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.079> starting<00:01:38.530> point

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just adjust for a starting point

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.600 
just adjust for a starting point
now<00:01:39.939> swing<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.750> an<00:01:40.840> X<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.560> got<00:01:41.829> that<00:01:42.070> fairly

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
now swing it in an X I got that fairly

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.819 
now swing it in an X I got that fairly
close<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:45.630> drag<00:01:46.630> my<00:01:46.810> Y<00:01:47.049> over<00:01:47.470> so<00:01:47.680> it's

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
close and now drag my Y over so it's

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.969 
close and now drag my Y over so it's
about<00:01:48.070> when<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.549> was<00:01:48.759> swinging<00:01:49.390> an<00:01:49.689> X<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.830> when

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
about when I was swinging an X and when

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.130 
about when I was swinging an X and when
I<00:01:54.009> sweep<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.429> indicator<00:01:54.939> around<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.630> never

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
I sweep the indicator around I never

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.660 
I sweep the indicator around I never
want<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.649> touch<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.829> arm

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
want to touch that arm

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.779 
want to touch that arm
I<00:01:57.700> always<00:01:57.909> want<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.329> hold<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.689> above<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
I always want to hold up above on the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.850 
I always want to hold up above on the
spindle<00:02:00.789> nose<00:02:01.030> itself<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.560> way<00:02:02.679> you're<00:02:02.829> not

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
spindle nose itself that way you're not

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:17.930 
spindle nose itself that way you're not
jostling<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.579> indicator<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.329> X<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.259> good

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.810 

yeah<00:02:18.480> let's<00:02:19.380> enter<00:02:19.680> indicators<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.490> moved

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
yeah let's enter indicators not moved

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.230 
yeah let's enter indicators not moved
off<00:02:21.030> from<00:02:21.240> zero

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360 

once<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.140> have<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> indicator<00:02:30.770> reading<00:02:31.040> zero

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
once I have the indicator reading zero

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
once I have the indicator reading zero
all<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.550> way<00:02:31.640> around<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> hole<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:33.080> then

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
all the way around the hole and then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.830 
all the way around the hole and then
I'll<00:02:33.320> come<00:02:33.470> over<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.770> my<00:02:33.890> readout<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.840> i'll

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
I'll come over to my readout and i'll

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.450 
I'll come over to my readout and i'll
zero<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.380> X<00:02:36.710> my<00:02:36.980> Y<00:02:37.010> because<00:02:37.490> that's<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:40.280> my

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
zero my X my Y because that's that's my

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.370 
zero my X my Y because that's that's my
zero<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.120> part<00:02:41.390> that's<00:02:41.690> enter<00:02:41.960> that<00:02:42.170> hole

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
zero on this part that's enter that hole

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.910 
zero on this part that's enter that hole
I<00:02:42.650> got<00:02:43.610> my<00:02:43.730> readout<00:02:44.090> zeroed<00:02:44.740> pick<00:02:45.740> my

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
I got my readout zeroed pick my

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920 
I got my readout zeroed pick my
indicator<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.760> by<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:46.940> hole<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.600> that's<00:02:47.720> how

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
indicator up by the hole and that's how

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.230 
indicator up by the hole and that's how
you've<00:02:48.080> used<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.100> dial<00:02:49.310> indicator<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.940> sweep<00:02:50.120> a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
you've used a dial indicator to sweep a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.350 
you've used a dial indicator to sweep a
hole<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.630> your<00:02:50.750> X<00:02:50.930> Y<00:02:51.110> zero
