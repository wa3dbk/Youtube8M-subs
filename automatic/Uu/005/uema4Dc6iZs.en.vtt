know<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.869> visually<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> design<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
know just visually I like the design on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
know just visually I like the design on
Android<00:01:57.000> more<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.659> refined

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
Android more I think it's more refined

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.240 
Android more I think it's more refined
so<00:01:59.219> performance<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.090> maps<00:02:00.360> navigation

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
so performance with maps navigation

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.560 
so performance with maps navigation
definitely<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:03.000> enough<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
definitely not good enough and so I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420 
definitely not good enough and so I
ended<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.930> using<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.469> android<00:02:04.890> phone<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.250> had

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
ended up using the android phone I had

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730 
ended up using the android phone I had
brought<00:02:06.049> also<00:02:07.049> when<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> came<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> web

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
brought also when it came to web

browsing again you know I've said before

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.270 
browsing again you know I've said before
it's<00:02:10.470> usable<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
use it and kind of just work with it but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420 
use it and kind of just work with it but
again<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.530> situation<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.160> didn't<00:02:21.340> have

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
again in this situation I didn't have

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.070 
again in this situation I didn't have
time<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.030> needed<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.420> web<00:02:22.600> page<00:02:22.810> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
time for that I needed a web page to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.530 
time for that I needed a web page to
load<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.620> need<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.280> pinch<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.910> zoom<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.330> needed

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.380 
load I need to pinch and zoom I needed
to<00:02:25.660> navigate<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:27.310> didn't<00:02:27.730> work<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.360> I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to navigate and it didn't work and so I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.449 
to navigate and it didn't work and so I
went<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.840> use<00:02:29.110> an<00:02:29.260> android<00:02:29.470> phone<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
went to use an android phone and a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.800 
went to use an android phone and a
couple<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.880> other<00:02:31.030> things<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.690> know

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
couple of other things you know

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.900 
couple of other things you know
specifically<00:02:32.319> with<00:02:32.590> apps<00:02:32.890> there<00:02:33.340> was<00:02:33.550> maybe

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
specifically with apps there was maybe

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.120 
specifically with apps there was maybe
an<00:02:34.120> app<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.660> needed<00:02:34.930> or<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.440> needed<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> get

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
an app that I needed or I needed to get

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.580 
an app that I needed or I needed to get
information<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> certain<00:02:37.209> thing<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.959> a

information on a certain thing and so a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.680 
information on a certain thing and so a
nap<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.310> specific<00:02:39.940> app<00:02:40.120> would<00:02:40.300> be<00:02:40.450> helpful

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
nap a specific app would be helpful

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.650 
nap a specific app would be helpful
helpful<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.130> either<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.480> it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
helpful for that and either you know it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.790 
helpful for that and either you know it
didn't<00:02:43.930> work<00:02:44.140> well<00:02:44.380> enough<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.709> the

blackberry or the blackberry app world

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.560 
blackberry or the blackberry app world
just<00:02:47.709> didn't<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.250> app<00:02:48.670> available<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
just didn't have that app available and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.610 
just didn't have that app available and
that's<00:02:49.660> something<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:49.989> I've<00:02:50.140> talked<00:02:50.380> about

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that's something that I've talked about

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.070 
that's something that I've talked about
before<00:02:50.800> how<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:52.150> know<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.300> app<00:02:52.420> selection<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
before how you know the app selection is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.830 
before how you know the app selection is
very<00:02:53.350> poor<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.820> was<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> situation<00:02:55.209> where

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
very poor and this was a situation where

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.270 
very poor and this was a situation where
it<00:02:55.989> actually<00:02:56.170> mattered<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.069> normally

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
it actually mattered you know normally

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.940 
it actually mattered you know normally
it's<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:58.239> okay<00:02:58.600> if<00:02:58.750> there's<00:02:58.930> no<00:02:59.080> ESPN<00:02:59.680> app

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it's like okay if there's no ESPN app

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.220 
it's like okay if there's no ESPN app
you<00:03:00.519> know<00:03:00.610> fine<00:03:00.910> whatever<00:03:01.360> or<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:01.810> there's<00:03:01.989> no

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
you know fine whatever or if there's no

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.710 
you know fine whatever or if there's no
app<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:03.489> where<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> games<00:03:04.239> aren't<00:03:04.540> that

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
app for this where the games aren't that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.420 
app for this where the games aren't that
great<00:03:04.930> its<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.950> deal<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
great its you know I can deal with it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.550 
great its you know I can deal with it
but<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:06.790> situation<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:08.110> needed<00:03:08.410> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
but in this situation I just needed it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.430 
but in this situation I just needed it
to<00:03:08.739> work<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.220> needed<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.580> specific<00:03:10.090> app<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.630> it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
to work I needed a specific app and it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.059 
to work I needed a specific app and it
didn't<00:03:11.709> have<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.750> was<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> good<00:03:14.230> test<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
didn't have it so it was a good test and

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.940 
didn't have it so it was a good test and
I<00:03:15.130> learned<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.519> lot<00:03:15.670> about<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.209> phone<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.500> in

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
I learned a lot about the phone and in

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.819 
I learned a lot about the phone and in
the<00:03:18.100> end<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.549> was<00:03:18.700> disappointed<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.500> think

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
the end I was disappointed and I think

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.000 
the end I was disappointed and I think
it<00:03:20.950> was<00:03:21.070> kind<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.610> more<00:03:21.850> honest<00:03:22.739> true<00:03:23.739> life

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
it was kind of a more honest true life

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.759 
it was kind of a more honest true life
test<00:03:24.790> rather<00:03:25.120> than<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:26.019> know<00:03:26.110> sitting<00:03:26.500> at<00:03:26.650> my

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
test rather than you know sitting at my

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.190 
test rather than you know sitting at my
desk<00:03:26.799> testing<00:03:27.700> out<00:03:27.820> web<00:03:28.000> browsing<00:03:28.299> or<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
desk testing out web browsing or you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.810 
desk testing out web browsing or you
know<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.590> around<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.070> testing<00:03:30.459> speed

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
know going around and testing speed

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.160 
know going around and testing speed
tests<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.269> what<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.510> usually<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.019> was<00:03:32.140> a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
tests like what we usually do it was a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.740 
tests like what we usually do it was a
real<00:03:32.470> world<00:03:32.829> tests<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> think<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.600> was<00:03:34.720> a

reasons why i switch to Windows Phone
because<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.280> thought<00:04:43.520> in<00:04:43.760> some<00:04:44.030> areas<00:04:44.450> it<00:04:44.660> was

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
because I thought in some areas it was

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.410 
because I thought in some areas it was
better<00:04:45.470> than<00:04:45.650> Android<00:04:46.370> now<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.030> was<00:04:47.180> my

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
better than Android now that was my

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.030 
better than Android now that was my
personal<00:04:47.930> preference<00:04:48.230> not<00:04:48.530> everyone<00:04:48.860> feels

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
that way but for me I felt in some ways

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.410 
that way but for me I felt in some ways
it<00:04:51.350> was<00:04:51.440> better<00:04:51.650> than<00:04:51.740> Android<00:04:52.420> for

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
it was better than Android for

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.360 
it was better than Android for
blackberry<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.870> don't<00:04:54.140> see<00:04:54.350> any<00:04:54.620> areas<00:04:55.340> where

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
blackberry I don't see any areas where

blackberry I don't see any areas where
it's<00:04:55.880> better<00:04:56.210> than<00:04:56.810> Android<00:04:57.290> Windows<00:04:57.440> Phone

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
it's better than Android Windows Phone

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.550 
it's better than Android Windows Phone
or<00:04:57.830> iOS<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.700> there's<00:04:58.850> very<00:04:59.180> few<00:04:59.300> areas<00:04:59.750> where

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
challenge but i would like to see that

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.500 
challenge but i would like to see that
because<00:05:24.620> what<00:05:25.340> we've<00:05:25.460> seen<00:05:25.700> so<00:05:25.760> far<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.270> pretty

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
because what we've seen so far is pretty

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.870 
because what we've seen so far is pretty
exciting<00:05:26.810> but<00:05:27.340> I'm<00:05:28.340> kind<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.610> getting<00:05:28.730> the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
exciting but I'm kind of getting the

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.090 
exciting but I'm kind of getting the
feeling<00:05:29.150> that<00:05:29.440> blackberry<00:05:30.440> in<00:05:30.620> its<00:05:30.770> current

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
feeling that blackberry in its current

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.270 
feeling that blackberry in its current
state<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.790> not<00:05:32.390> for<00:05:32.750> me<00:05:32.900> but<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:33.890> know<00:05:34.010> it's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
state is not for me but you know it's

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.970 
state is not for me but you know it's
day<00:05:34.490> 18<00:05:34.940> things<00:05:35.690> could<00:05:35.960> change<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.620> think

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
day 18 things could change but I think

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860 
day 18 things could change but I think
I'm<00:05:37.160> kind<00:05:37.580> of<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.730> the<00:05:37.820> point<00:05:38.090> now<00:05:38.150> where<00:05:38.270> you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
I'm kind of to the point now where you

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.980 
I'm kind of to the point now where you
know<00:05:39.260> this<00:05:39.440> is<00:05:39.470> what<00:05:39.980> it<00:05:40.100> is<00:05:40.480> I've<00:05:41.480> kind<00:05:41.810> of

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
know this is what it is I've kind of

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.280 
know this is what it is I've kind of
already<00:05:42.410> seen<00:05:43.400> its<00:05:43.760> its<00:05:44.300> potential<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:45.050> guess

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
already seen its its potential I guess

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.580 
already seen its its potential I guess
or<00:05:45.530> what<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:45.830> could<00:05:46.070> be<00:05:46.100> what<00:05:46.700> it's<00:05:46.820> not<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.450> I

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
or what it could be what it's not and I

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.780 
or what it could be what it's not and I
think<00:05:48.590> I'm<00:05:48.680> kind<00:05:48.860> of<00:05:48.950> accepting<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.400> now<00:05:49.580> but

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
think I'm kind of accepting that now but

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.330 
think I'm kind of accepting that now but
that's<00:05:50.480> my<00:05:50.690> day<00:05:50.750> 18<00:05:51.260> update<00:05:51.650> I'll<00:05:51.860> be<00:05:51.980> back<00:05:52.010> on
