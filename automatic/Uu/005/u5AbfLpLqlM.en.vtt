00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey what's up guys so today

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.650
I'm gonna be talking about the Samsung
Galaxy S6

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.300
And the S6 edge and before we start
this video

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.920
I just wanna say the only difference
between the Samsung Galaxy S6

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.130
And the 6 edge is that the Samsung
Galaxy

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.540
S6 edge has a curved display and

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.980
That's it and this is only the main
difference between them so the main

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.000
Things that I look in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.340
Before buying a new phone are The
Design

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.460
The Screen The Battery The Camera

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.539
And The Processor so first let's talk
about the design

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.100
It has a gorilla glass 4 in the front and in the back

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.079
Which is pretty dope and the cool thing
about it it has a metal frame

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.870
Not the plasticy frame that made to look like metal

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.970
But actual metal and the new cool thing
about it as well that it is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.990
Way thinner it is 6.8mm thin

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.020
So this phone is rocking 5.1 inch
inch QHD display

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.130
With a 577 ppi

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.080
Which is insane and the screen is a
Super AMOLED screen

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.840
The blacks should be deeper and the white
should be whiter

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.820
So now let's talk about the camera the camera has been

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840
Improved very very much so they've put

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.620
A F1.9 aperture in this lense

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.570
In the front camera which has been
improved to 5MP

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.760
Shoots 1080p and 720p for videos but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.960
The cool thing about the lower
aperture is that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.990
The low light photos will be much

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.360
Much more sharper and you

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.790
you're going to have the amazing
shallow depth of field

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.150
A DSLR like photos so what the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.390
F1.9 aperture allows you to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.780
Get more light into the lense
which translate to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.460
Better low light photos and sharper

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.240
also they've putted a live HDR in the front facing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.330
camera which is pretty insane

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.580
So now let's talk about the rear camera
which is a 16 megapixel rear camera

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.890
The megapixels aren't much different
from the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.110
Galaxy S5 but the camera is not all about
the megapixels

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.730
Um it has a Optical Image Stabilizer and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.330
They've put a IR blaster in the back so you
can get

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.300
Accurate white balance um white balance
is such an important thing

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.680
When taking photos but people doesn't
take that for granted

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.520
And it also has an F1.9 aperture the cool
thing about this they have specifically

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.780
Made the home button

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.440
For the camera and the camera is already on

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.220
If you press the home button twice
you'll get to the camera

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.700
In 0.7 seconds which is pretty fast if
you want to capture the moment

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.390
And the really awesome thing about this is
the object tracking AF if it is as they

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.070
Claim

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.840
And you can get your object that you
want to record or take a picture of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.769
In focus It'll be very very cool
but I don't think it's gonna work that good

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.540
From the first time they put it in this
camera but for the next jen

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.720
Phone it will be great so now let's talk about the
battery

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.360
The S6 has a 2550mAh Battery but

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.090
The S6 edge has a 2600mAh

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.100
Battery this little slight
difference in the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.310
Battery well go to the edges on the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.370
S6 edge to operate them but

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.330
It's not a major difference and another
cool feature about it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.470
It is the fast-charging I'm we've
already seen this on the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.430
Note 4 but they claim 10 minute charge will
get you up to 4 hour

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.510
Juice of the battery which is pretty
amazing and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.160
Other cool features they both have built
in wireless charger

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.330
Which is pretty pretty great and useful

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.930
I bought a wireless charger but I
haven't bought the adapter for it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.720
Yet so i can't use it on my galaxy s4 I
have here

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.340
But if to have this feature built-in
will be amazing and they claim that I

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.209
Will work with

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.830
Any Charger QI Charger Samsung's charger

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.580
Any charger and thing that I didn't like
about this metal frame 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.010
And the Gorilla Glass 4 in the front and
in the back that it is

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.400
That you cannot remove the back cover that means no swapping batteries

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400
And no external SD cards which has
been very useful

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.510
For all the Samsung users and now it's
over

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.550
We cannot use this feature anymore

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.840
Now let's talk about the other features
that they offered they say

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.220
That they have a 14nm processor

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.710
With a DD4 RAM which is pretty awesome and they
say it's smaller

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.690
And it's gonna be much more
sufficient will have to get the

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.680
Phone and get hand's on review for this
to see if it

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.640
Really is that much different and of course it's a 3GB RAM

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.660
And the new thing that they have

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.500
Which is Samsung pay i personally

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.050
Didn't like this much because as you all know

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.530
Apple did it so Samsung must do it so anyway

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.540
I'm not trying to do anything right here
but I am

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.389
Just saying so Samsung pay contains
of a

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.770
NFC and MST what this allows you to do

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.440
Is the put your credit card in the Samsung
pay app and use it as

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.580
Any credit card no NFC required with the MST

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.820
What this allows you to do is to
get it working

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.240
With a lot more carriers what I liked
about this phone is that they

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.400
Improved the fingerprint scanner it's not
like the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.370
Galaxy S5 that you need to swipe to
open this

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.690
This phone no instead of that you can
simply

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.300
Just unlock it by touching it like this

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.840
Just by touching it and it will unlock it will be available in 32

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.010
64 and 128GB

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.080
Which is pretty amazing to get rid of

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.240
The 16GB version instead

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.660
32 this is good instead of the SD card
slot they decided to

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.430
Bump up the storage of the phone so what i think about this phone this phone is

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.950
Great

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.970
The camera is pretty much improved and
the battery

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.979
I don't know but they say it will be up to

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.090
13 hours of use on wifi

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.380
We'll have to test that to see how much it
will last so this is the first great

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.320
Phone that I actually like very much from
Samsung

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.560
I like the metal frame and the improved

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.870
Camera about it but I didn't like about
it we

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.510
We don't have the

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.860
Removeable back which is pretty sad that you won't be able to swap your battery and

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.330
You have an external SD card slot
which is a sacrifice that had

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.650

Drop me a comment below what you
think about the Galaxy S6 and

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.350
And which one would you get the S6
or the S6 edge

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.770
Personally I like the S6 Edge more than
the S6

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.870
But that's my opinion tell me
guys in the comments what you want

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.650
