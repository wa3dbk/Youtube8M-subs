00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.770 
don't know and that was a quick guide if
you<00:03:29.590> can't<00:03:29.829> get<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.159> fairy<00:03:30.430> ring<00:03:30.699> and<00:03:31.000> you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you can't get to the fairy ring and you

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.179 
you can't get to the fairy ring and you
don't<00:03:31.959> know<00:03:32.079> how<00:03:32.229> to<00:03:32.290> get<00:03:32.530> yelled<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.889> show<00:03:33.040> on

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
don't know how to get yelled to show on

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.780 
don't know how to get yelled to show on
the<00:03:33.280> map<00:03:33.430> warm<00:03:33.849> not<00:03:34.530> basically<00:03:35.530> right<00:03:35.889> here<00:03:35.919> so

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the map warm not basically right here so

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.580 
the map warm not basically right here so
where<00:03:37.299> we<00:03:37.419> start<00:03:37.689> off<00:03:37.840> was<00:03:38.049> there

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
where we start off was there

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.439 
where we start off was there
that's<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.579> fairing<00:03:39.939> that<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.090> came<00:03:40.269> through

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
that's the fairing that I came through

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.899 
that's the fairing that I came through
basically<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.470> running<00:03:41.769> across<00:03:42.040> jump<00:03:42.459> up<00:03:42.669> or

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
basically just running across jump up or

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.960 
basically just running across jump up or
go<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.379> tree<00:03:44.590> gnome<00:03:44.909> stronghold<00:03:45.909> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
go to the the tree gnome stronghold I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.059 
go to the the tree gnome stronghold I
think<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.329> take<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.049> glider<00:03:47.319> run<00:03:47.739> straight<00:03:48.009> up

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
think is take the glider run straight up

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.259 
think is take the glider run straight up
that's<00:03:48.340> quite<00:03:48.609> easy<00:03:48.790> if<00:03:48.970> you've<00:03:49.090> done<00:03:49.239> that

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that's quite easy if you've done that

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.899 
that's quite easy if you've done that
and<00:03:50.129> basically<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.310> come<00:03:51.430> here<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.699> fish

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
and basically you come here you fish

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.699 
and basically you come here you fish
them<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.479> you<00:03:52.569> can<00:03:52.659> use<00:03:52.780> fairings<00:03:53.229> just<00:03:53.500> nip

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
them if you can use fairings just nip

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.679 
them if you can use fairings just nip
there<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.069> back<00:03:54.219> it's<00:03:54.939> simple<00:03:55.269> if<00:03:55.359> anything

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
there and back it's simple if anything

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.449 
there and back it's simple if anything
goes<00:03:55.840> well<00:03:56.079> but<00:03:56.739> hopefully<00:03:56.889> a<00:03:57.159> little<00:03:57.280> like

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
goes well but hopefully a little like

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.249 
goes well but hopefully a little like
you<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.729> buy<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.150> from<00:03:58.419> him<00:03:58.479> and<00:03:58.629> cook<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.139> and

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
you just buy it from him and cook it and

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.289 
you just buy it from him and cook it and
that's<00:03:59.439> done<00:03:59.709> but<00:04:00.519> hopefully<00:04:00.879> this<00:04:01.000> guides

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
that's done but hopefully this guides
