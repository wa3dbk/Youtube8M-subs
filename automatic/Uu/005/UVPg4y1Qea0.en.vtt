00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.780
 draw a sitting cat 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 very easy to even 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 four year old child was able to draw 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.189
 him for this we need a sheet 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.439
 paper preferably pastel but if not 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.320
 you can do a good sheet of paper 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.910
 paint in gouache 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.660
 also himself soft himself 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 material 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 it may be samghin chalk or sauce 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.739
 either you can take the whole set yourself 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.719
 pastels 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.230
 so how do we start work 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 draw from the head 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 the head is a circle just above and middle 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.480
 leaf we draw a circle painted 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.789
 now draw a body this we will have 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.610
 a triangle for example like this now we 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:15.900
 draw the front legs it will be with us 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 sticks 1 and 2 and draw pads like 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 sitting our code will be able to draw 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 and pads paws back now we 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 let's draw its tail you can draw here 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.340
 this way so as not to merge with us 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.610
 weak body we can take for example paws 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 plump paint we can take and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.740
 other shades let us for example 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 will be a little red 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.700
 hall 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 fluffy 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.170
 almost like a squirrel can mix colors 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.510
 one other add so it will be more 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.030
 scenic interesting back to head 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.500
 on the head of course must be too 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 put chalk on the edge of the sheet and do 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.380
 this way up and down 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.700

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:39.880
 up and down and another triangle 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:44.350
 guns need to paint too now draw 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.480
 face to start we make a spout 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.930
 put where we will have our muzzle 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:58.300
 now from this spout draw one 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.080
 circle 2 circle is such counters 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.630
 as i call face 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:10.769

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.460
 Around him 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.740
 for example it could be a rug on 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:51.600
 which our code sits one strip 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:54.390
 another strip and what can 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.060
 just do it where it sits 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.510

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.230
