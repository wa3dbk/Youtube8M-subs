00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
if you do the maths the old McLaren

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.209 
if you do the maths the old McLaren
could<00:00:47.540> actually<00:00:48.020> stand<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.710> bit<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.980> chance

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
could actually stand a bit of a chance

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.270 
could actually stand a bit of a chance
here<00:00:49.550> because<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.840> doesn't<00:00:51.110> weigh<00:00:51.440> that<00:00:51.739> much

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
here because it doesn't weigh that much

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.160 
here because it doesn't weigh that much
more<00:00:52.550> than<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.850> touring<00:00:53.210> car<00:00:53.420> weighs<00:00:53.870> just

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
more than the touring car weighs just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.130 
more than the touring car weighs just
under<00:00:54.350> 1500<00:00:55.219> kilograms<00:00:55.690> whereas<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.809> minimum

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
under 1500 kilograms whereas the minimum

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.100 
under 1500 kilograms whereas the minimum
weight<00:00:57.320> for<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> touring<00:00:57.949> car<00:00:58.129> is<00:00:58.309> 1280<00:00:59.110> okay

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110

there's a difference there but it's not
a<00:01:01.309> gigantic<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:04.220> trade-off<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:05.000> is

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
a gigantic and the trade-off of that is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.749 
a gigantic and the trade-off of that is
that<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.539> McLaren<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.020> course<00:01:06.229> has<00:01:06.530> 630<00:01:07.490> old

that the McLaren of course has 630 old
horsepower<00:01:08.270> whereas<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.780> touring<00:01:09.140> car

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350

they've just told me only has about 350

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.490 
they've just told me only has about 350
maybe<00:01:13.300> 360<00:01:14.300> if<00:01:14.420> they<00:01:14.570> run<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.750> little<00:01:14.990> bit<00:01:15.319> more

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
maybe 360 if they run a little bit more

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.940 
maybe 360 if they run a little bit more
boost<00:01:16.149> so<00:01:17.149> really<00:01:17.599> in<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.380> straight<00:01:18.679> line

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
boost so really in a straight line

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.070 
boost so really in a straight line
the<00:01:19.310> McLaren<00:01:19.580> should<00:01:19.970> absolutely<00:01:20.300> demolish

the bike however is another matter that
weighs<00:01:25.820> about<00:01:27.159> 160<00:01:28.159> kilograms<00:01:28.670> before<00:01:29.509> you

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
weighs about 160 kilograms before you

very nearly 200 horsepower it has got
200<00:01:35.990> horsepower<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.649> when<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.009> do<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.369> mass

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
200 horsepower so when you do the mass

the McLaren it feels I would suggest a
lot<00:02:43.950> quicker<00:02:44.820> than<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.210> touring<00:02:45.600> car<00:02:45.920> surely

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

the<00:02:48.840> trouble<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.290> though<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.620> doesn't<00:02:49.800> develop

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
the trouble is though it doesn't develop

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
not really getting as much as I need

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.220

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the brakes have just started to go a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.570 
the brakes have just started to go a
little<00:03:15.420> bit<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.890> very<00:03:17.280> hot<00:03:17.550> day

oh<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.880> just<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.210> difference<00:03:22.390> between

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
oh it's just the difference between

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.130 
oh it's just the difference between
absolutely<00:03:24.550> bespoke<00:03:25.030> competition<00:03:25.660> car<00:03:25.870> and

absolutely bespoke competition car and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.770 
absolutely bespoke competition car and

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
something that you could drive home in

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.960 
something that you could drive home in
at<00:03:29.020> night<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.530> then<00:03:29.710> down<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.220> Sainsbury's<00:03:30.490> in

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the next day okay what do I think I

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.110 
the next day okay what do I think I
reckon<00:03:34.380> if<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.220> McLaren<00:03:36.670> can<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:36.970> within

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
reckon if the McLaren can get within

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.380 
reckon if the McLaren can get within
four<00:03:37.660> four<00:03:38.650> seconds<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.460> Touring<00:03:39.820> Car<00:03:40.090> it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
four four seconds of the Touring Car it

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.350 
four four seconds of the Touring Car it
will<00:03:40.570> be<00:03:40.720> doing<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.910> credibly<00:03:42.910> well

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
will be doing in credibly well

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.420 
will be doing in credibly well
considering<00:03:43.840> your<00:03:44.050> number<00:03:44.290> plates<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:44.860> it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
considering your number plates on if it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.620 
considering your number plates on if it
can<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.850> within<00:03:47.640> eight<00:03:48.640> seconds<00:03:49.240> of<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.420> bike

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
can get within eight seconds of the bike

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.180 
can get within eight seconds of the bike
I'll<00:03:49.840> be<00:03:49.960> amazed<00:03:50.260> because<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.710> bike<00:03:50.980> this

the<00:04:05.350> Superbike<00:04:05.770> up<00:04:06.040> front<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.640> he<00:04:06.910> could

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
the Superbike up front so that he could

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.140 
the Superbike up front so that he could
set<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.450> pace<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:08.040> asked<00:04:09.040> him<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.340> go<00:04:09.490> nice<00:04:09.820> and

slowly so that other chaps in the cars

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.660 
slowly so that other chaps in the cars
could<00:04:12.850> keep<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.620> Shedden<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.740> just<00:04:14.980> about<00:04:15.250> ok

could keep up Shedden was just about ok

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.270 
could keep up Shedden was just about ok
with<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.180> BTCC<00:04:16.780> car<00:04:17.260> but<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:17.980> got

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
with that in the BTCC car but I got

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.400 
with that in the BTCC car but I got
dropped<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.790> McLaren<00:04:19.359> after<00:04:19.690> about<00:04:19.870> three

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
dropped in the McLaren after about three

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.830 
dropped in the McLaren after about three
corners<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.609> after<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.060> they<00:04:22.630> just

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
corners and after that they just

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.620 
corners and after that they just
disappeared<00:04:23.560> what<00:04:24.340> surprised<00:04:24.700> me<00:04:24.730> most<00:04:24.940> when

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
disappeared what surprised me most when

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.320 
disappeared what surprised me most when
I<00:04:25.660> was<00:04:25.870> trying<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.560> failing<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:27.580> follow<00:04:27.940> them

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
I was trying and failing to follow them

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.120 
I was trying and failing to follow them
apart<00:04:28.930> from<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> fact<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.650> bike<00:04:29.830> was<00:04:30.010> in

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
apart from the fact that the bike was in

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.010 
apart from the fact that the bike was in
a<00:04:30.220> different<00:04:30.460> legal<00:04:31.150> on<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.600> main<00:04:31.780> pit

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020
