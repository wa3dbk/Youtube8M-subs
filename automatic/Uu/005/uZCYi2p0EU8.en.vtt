00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.670
 the grotto on the line in this video I will say moses 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 what kind of heroes like bloodseeker and venga 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 a bunch is good because it allows 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 ganga hero be able 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.000
 and just on aggression winning games so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.340
 build skill and you are right now 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 see on the screen about the skillbuild bam and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.079
 kira I won't say anything he can 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.260
 be basically any but i prefer 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 swing through 3 to always catch up 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 the enemy and that's about the wenge skill I 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.450
 I will talk very important not to pump 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.570
 third ability while you stand on 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 lines so how are you going to eat her and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.879
 you will be very uncomfortable in the end 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.390
 the enemy was led on the sixth or seventh 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.809
 level and 1 skill build we have already finished 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.300
 Now I will explain to you the principle of bundles on 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.900
 that in the seventh level the bloodseeker throws 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 his ulta on the enemy after which venga him 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 with you after this gives him the camp and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
 the second after which you just say 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 the enemy since he cannot move 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.110
 if the enemy is any necker and starts 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 you cast spells vlasik 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.659
 can also give him a solo 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.460
 also worth considering that yes max you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.540
 passes even if the target is in bkb 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 or 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 rip or omnica well or in general in any 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.860
 other 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.170
 protection from magic antimag bugs get 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.649
 far away big damage if trying 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 jump now I'll show you what 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.750
 net damage will get a goal if 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.979
 bloodseeker mumps will be the seventh 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.979
 level 11 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.610
 16 levels 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.220
 also 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.020
 force can be added to this damage 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.539
 staff who will collect venga or 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.910
 bloodseeker although on the power of cyrus I am extremely 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.190
 I do not recommend collecting force staff better 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.340
 immediately buy normal things on the board 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.240
 and and so what do we have venga with her 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 ranged combat 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.820
 great attack animation and quite good 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.000
 Damage allows hasid opponents in 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.610
 it was the beginning of the stickers 2 easy 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 standing on the line and farm creeps 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.670
 after which they get the seventh level 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 win their line go further 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.940
 help the rest of the line gives me carry 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.489
 Opponent farm as constantly 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.100
 will run and kill him 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.800
 and by this win your team's game on 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.720
