00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
way up in the air if you want to they

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.110 
way up in the air if you want to they
recommend<00:04:33.039> about<00:04:33.160> four<00:04:33.520> foot<00:04:33.729> above<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
recommend about four foot above the

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.879 
recommend about four foot above the
ground<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.810> we're<00:04:35.229> definitely<00:04:35.289> a<00:04:35.530> little<00:04:35.680> bit

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
ground so we're definitely a little bit

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.920 
ground so we're definitely a little bit
lower<00:04:36.100> than<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.660> recommendation<00:04:37.660> but<00:04:37.810> it

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
lower than that recommendation but it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.750 
lower than that recommendation but it
doesn't<00:04:38.139> really<00:04:38.229> matter<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:39.070> idea<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.610> that

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
doesn't really matter the idea is that

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.790 
doesn't really matter the idea is that
it's<00:04:40.300> slung<00:04:40.690> up<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.169> air<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.470> get<00:04:41.620> that

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
it's slung up in the air you get that

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.340 
it's slung up in the air you get that
