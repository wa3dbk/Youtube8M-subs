you know designed to lengthen lashes and
lift<00:01:59.710> them<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.330> watch<00:02:01.660> again<00:02:01.690> little<00:02:02.560> curler

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.860 

the<00:02:11.740> brush<00:02:11.950> shape<00:02:12.220> does<00:02:12.430> fit<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.240> curve

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
