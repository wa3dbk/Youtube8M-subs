I'm going to do is squeeze these prongs
back<00:00:55.860> together<00:00:56.059> using<00:00:57.059> tweezers<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.969> see

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
back together using tweezers you can see

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
back together using tweezers you can see
that<00:01:01.070> okay<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:04.170> getting<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that okay and then it's not getting a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
that okay and then it's not getting a
good<00:01:04.830> contact<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> ground<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
good contact on the ground and the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
good contact on the ground and the
ground<00:01:06.720> touches<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> outside<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
ground touches the outside of this and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.080 
ground touches the outside of this and
the<00:01:08.970> positives<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.600> inside<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the positives and inside so because it's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
the positives and inside so because it's
not<00:01:12.150> getting<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> good<00:01:12.810> ground<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.560> can't

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
not getting a good ground it can't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.429 
not getting a good ground it can't
charge<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> ground<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.470> prong<00:01:16.799> enough

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
charge the ground is that prong enough

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.630 
charge the ground is that prong enough
right<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.680> don't<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:22.610> see<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
right here don't you see that see that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
right here don't you see that see that
right<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> ground<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
right there so that's the ground and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
right there so that's the ground and
that<00:01:25.950> touches<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.490> outside<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> charging

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that touches the outside of the charging

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.359 
that touches the outside of the charging
port<00:01:28.430> connector<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
port connector so what you want to do is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
port connector so what you want to do is
get<00:01:32.369> underneath<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:34.340> okay<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.950> drop

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
get underneath that okay and not drop

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.090 
get underneath that okay and not drop
down<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:39.060> underneath<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.680> then

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.770 

bring<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:49.579> okay

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
bring that out a little bit okay

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.070 
bring that out a little bit okay
so<00:01:52.260> once<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.650> behind<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.540> with<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> skinny

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
so once you get behind it with a skinny

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.710 
so once you get behind it with a skinny
flat<00:01:55.440> head<00:01:55.680> screwdriver<00:01:57.560> okay<00:01:59.060> just<00:02:00.060> ever<00:02:00.420> so

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
flat head screwdriver okay just ever so

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.980 
flat head screwdriver okay just ever so
slightly<00:02:01.550> use<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.730> like<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:02.940> lever<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.990> turn

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
slightly use that like a lever and turn

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
slightly use that like a lever and turn
that<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.610> enough<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.060> it'll

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that out just them just enough so it'll

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.790 
that out just them just enough so it'll
give<00:02:09.899> tension<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> put<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.040> your<00:02:11.280> report

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
give tension when you put in your report

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
give tension when you put in your report
okay<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.250> now<00:02:14.430> when<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> plug<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.240> should

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
okay so now when you plug that in should

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.640 
okay so now when you plug that in should
charge<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.500> your<00:02:17.270> battery<00:02:18.380> let's<00:02:19.380> go<00:02:19.530> ahead

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
charge up your battery let's go ahead

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.770 
charge up your battery let's go ahead
and<00:02:19.860> take<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> look<00:02:23.540> all<00:02:24.540> right<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:26.660> let's<00:02:27.660> go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and take a look all right so let's go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.300 
and take a look all right so let's go
ahead<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.130> plug<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:32.959> there<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.080> goes<00:02:34.310> so

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
ahead and plug that in there it goes so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.260 
ahead and plug that in there it goes so
that's<00:02:35.520> how<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:35.910> it
