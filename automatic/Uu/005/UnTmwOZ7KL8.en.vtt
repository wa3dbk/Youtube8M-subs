00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
about that one but people say these

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.540 
about that one but people say these
Itachi's<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:14.960> really<00:04:15.200> good<00:04:15.350> grinders<00:04:15.860> but

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
Itachi's have really good grinders but

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.340 
Itachi's have really good grinders but
it<00:04:16.670> is<00:04:16.790> noticeably<00:04:17.420> heavier<00:04:17.630> than<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.050> makita

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
it is noticeably heavier than the makita

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.860 
it is noticeably heavier than the makita
and<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:19.070> probably<00:04:19.550> weighs<00:04:19.700> twice<00:04:20.060> what<00:04:20.360> any<00:04:20.540> my

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870

four<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.500> half<00:04:21.530> inch<00:04:21.860> grinders<00:04:22.280> away<00:04:22.490> so

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
four and a half inch grinders away so

00:04:23.090 --> 00:05:00.080 
four and a half inch grinders away so
that<00:04:23.300> being<00:04:23.450> said<00:04:23.630> I'm<00:04:23.900> going<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> try<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.380> out

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.520 

oh<00:05:02.090> oh<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.940> think<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.389> animal<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.960> Annabelle

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530
