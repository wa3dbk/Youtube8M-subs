00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
put that nest back to where it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
put that nest back to where it
originally<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> parents<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.439> find

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
originally was so the parents can find

originally was so the parents can find
them<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.159> birds<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.060> poor

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
them you see birds have a very poor

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.240 
them you see birds have a very poor
sense<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.689> smell<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:29.009> very

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sense of smell but they have a very very

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
sense of smell but they have a very very
strong<00:01:30.590> bond<00:01:31.590> between<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.340> parents<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
strong bond between the parents and the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
strong bond between the parents and the
offspring<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.860> every<00:01:35.159> other<00:01:35.189> animal

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
offspring just like every other animal

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.520 
offspring just like every other animal
which<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:36.570> powerful<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.290> bond<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
which is pretty powerful a bond that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.179 
which is pretty powerful a bond that
can't<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.040> broken<00:01:38.220> easily<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.619> decided<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can't be broken easily so I decided to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.569 
can't be broken easily so I decided to
reconstruct<00:01:42.180> their<00:01:42.630> nest<00:01:43.009> put<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
reconstruct their nest put them back in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
reconstruct their nest put them back in
waste<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> roughly<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> same

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
waste them back up to roughly the same

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.370 
waste them back up to roughly the same
spot<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.570> see<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> parents<00:01:49.079> would<00:01:49.170> come

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
spot and see if the parents would come

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.490 
spot and see if the parents would come
back<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.880> problem<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> nest<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.170> the

hi<00:03:55.260> I'm<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:56.980> scientific<00:03:57.459> purposes<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.150> we

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
hi I'm now for scientific purposes so we

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.790 
hi I'm now for scientific purposes so we
can<00:03:58.330> get<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> better<00:03:58.599> understanding<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.319> what

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
can get a better understanding of what

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.330 
can get a better understanding of what
exactly<00:03:59.830> goes<00:04:00.430> down<00:04:00.790> in<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.360> woodpecker's<00:04:01.959> nest

is not a colonoscopy see woodpeckers

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.760 
is not a colonoscopy see woodpeckers
unlike<00:04:12.489> other<00:04:12.670> birds<00:04:13.170> have<00:04:14.170> their<00:04:14.440> nests

going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> Peck<00:04:54.830> their<00:04:55.070> way<00:04:55.220> out<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.520> there

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
going to Peck their way out of there

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.080 
going to Peck their way out of there
climb<00:04:56.630> up<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.050> jump<00:04:57.110> I'm<00:04:57.710> not<00:04:58.580> sure<00:04:58.820> but<00:05:01.090> keep

you<00:05:02.240> posted<00:05:02.660> on<00:05:02.750> that

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
you posted on that

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.100 
you posted on that
I<00:05:03.259> just<00:05:04.160> thought<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.729> know<00:05:04.940> if<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.840> can

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
I just thought that you know if I can

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.999 
I just thought that you know if I can
save<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> baby<00:05:06.650> bird<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:08.330> can<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:08.690> and

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
save a baby bird and so can you and

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.270 
save a baby bird and so can you and
sometimes<00:05:10.009> as<00:05:10.550> we<00:05:11.479> are<00:05:11.630> being<00:05:12.470> human<00:05:12.889> and

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
sometimes as we are being human and

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.810 
sometimes as we are being human and
doing<00:05:14.270> human<00:05:14.539> things<00:05:14.919> we<00:05:15.919> put<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.310> lives<00:05:16.520> of

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
doing human things we put the lives of

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.659 
doing human things we put the lives of
animals<00:05:17.630> at<00:05:17.900> risk<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:21.410> I<00:05:21.979> think<00:05:22.010> that<00:05:22.460> we<00:05:22.580> need

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
animals at risk and I think that we need

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.219 
animals at risk and I think that we need
to<00:05:22.789> remember<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:23.470> they<00:05:25.930> they<00:05:26.930> have<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.050> right

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
to remember that they they have a right

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.710 
to remember that they they have a right
to<00:05:27.289> be<00:05:27.470> here<00:05:27.680> just<00:05:27.949> as<00:05:28.430> much<00:05:28.610> if<00:05:28.789> not<00:05:28.820> more<00:05:28.970> so

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
to be here just as much if not more so

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.610 
to be here just as much if not more so
than<00:05:30.650> us<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.100> if<00:05:31.340> we<00:05:31.789> do<00:05:32.000> find<00:05:32.600> ourselves<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:33.260> a

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
than us so if we do find ourselves in a

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.790 
than us so if we do find ourselves in a
position<00:05:33.889> where<00:05:34.520> we<00:05:34.729> have<00:05:34.970> jeopardized<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
position where we have jeopardized the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.339 
position where we have jeopardized the
life<00:05:37.010> of<00:05:37.250> another<00:05:37.669> living<00:05:38.150> animal<00:05:38.599> I<00:05:38.750> think<00:05:39.020> we

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
life of another living animal I think we

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.240 
life of another living animal I think we
should<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.590> everything<00:05:39.800> we<00:05:39.979> can<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:42.070> save<00:05:43.070> it
