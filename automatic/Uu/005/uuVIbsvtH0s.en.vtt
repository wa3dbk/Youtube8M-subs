00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
response Andy to a previous video we did

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
response Andy to a previous video we did
about<00:00:20.790> fast<00:00:21.330> hips<00:00:21.599> so<00:00:22.170> fast<00:00:22.470> hips<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.860> all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
about fast hips so fast hips is all

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
about fast hips so fast hips is all
about<00:00:23.250> getting<00:00:23.960> disassociation<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
about getting disassociation in the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.260 
about getting disassociation in the
lower<00:00:25.349> body<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.800> body<00:00:26.099> lower<00:00:26.730> body<00:00:26.820> going

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
lower body to a body lower body going

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.929 
lower body to a body lower body going
fast<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.200> arms<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> fall<00:00:28.950> in<00:00:29.100> behind<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
fast so the arms can fall in behind and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.580 
fast so the arms can fall in behind and
get<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.270> club<00:00:30.449> more<00:00:30.630> underneath<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.350> plane

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
get the club more underneath the plane

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.360 
get the club more underneath the plane
and<00:00:31.859> stop<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.309> slice<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.739> KCK<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.040> exact

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and stop the slice so KCK has the exact

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
and stop the slice so KCK has the exact
opposite<00:00:35.910> problem<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.470> we're

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
opposite problem to that so we're

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
opposite problem to that so we're
assuming<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.519> Casey<00:00:38.790> fires<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.989> lower<00:00:40.170> body

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
assuming that Casey fires the lower body

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.150 
assuming that Casey fires the lower body
too<00:00:40.650> quickly

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
too quickly

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
too quickly
and<00:00:41.340> then<00:00:41.760> gets<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.059> arms<00:00:42.600> stuck<00:00:43.080> underneath

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and then gets the arms stuck underneath

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
and then gets the arms stuck underneath
the<00:00:43.890> plate<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> club<00:00:44.460> underneath<00:00:44.790> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the plate of the club underneath the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.640 
the plate of the club underneath the
plane<00:00:45.180> should<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> say<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.229> it<00:00:46.290> has<00:00:46.470> to

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
plane should I say and then it has to

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.770 
plane should I say and then it has to
use<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.400> hands<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> arms<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.479> recover

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
use the hands and the arms to recover

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.799 
use the hands and the arms to recover
the<00:00:48.900> face<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.769> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.040> hook<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> Andy

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the face and then we have a hook so Andy

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
the face and then we have a hook so Andy
first<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.229> all<00:00:55.290> can<00:00:55.409> we<00:00:55.470> just<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.739> through<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
first of all can we just go through that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.280 
first of all can we just go through that
so<00:00:56.640> swing<00:00:56.940> fault<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:57.869> mentioned<00:00:58.199> there

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
so swing fault as you mentioned there

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.590 
so swing fault as you mentioned there

point which now from here it's very
difficult<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.690> start<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> golf<00:01:10.200> ball<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.560> line

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
we can see when I do this it gets well

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
we can see when I do this it gets well
underneath<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.090> plane<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.870> that<00:01:25.020> Golf<00:01:25.260> Club

the<00:02:11.640> grip<00:02:11.909> end<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> golf<00:02:12.599> club<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.709> way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the grip end of the golf club on the way

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.699 
the grip end of the golf club on the way

so this is going to really feel that you
are<00:02:18.690> swinging<00:02:18.930> more<00:02:19.590> across<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.730> swing

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
are swinging more across the swing

are swinging more across the swing
playing<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.630> more<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> left

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
playing a little bit more to the left

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.840 
playing a little bit more to the left
but<00:02:22.890> there's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> lot<00:02:23.160> less<00:02:23.310> chance<00:02:23.610> now<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
but there's a lot less chance now if you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.190 
but there's a lot less chance now if you
look<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> face<00:02:24.300> position<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.870> Pierce

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
look at the face position there Pierce

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
look at the face position there Pierce
that<00:02:25.770> face<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.100> not<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> flip<00:02:26.520> over

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that face is not going to flip over

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.100 
that face is not going to flip over
okay<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.240> look<00:02:27.330> at<00:02:27.450> camera<00:02:27.630> two<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.020> we

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
okay if we look at camera two here we

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.350 
okay if we look at camera two here we
can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.530> club<00:02:28.770> handled<00:02:29.640> getting<00:02:29.940> into

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
be here this is just a feeling that's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420 
be here this is just a feeling that's
going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> hopefully<00:02:58.380> getting<00:02:58.830> somewhere<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
going to hopefully getting somewhere in

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.490 
going to hopefully getting somewhere in
between<00:02:59.550> and<00:03:00.240> getting<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.750> playing<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
between and getting on playing with the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
between and getting on playing with the
square<00:03:01.740> face<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.160> always<00:03:02.280> say<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.910> you're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
square face I always say if you're

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520 
square face I always say if you're
someone<00:03:03.480> who's<00:03:03.570> well<00:03:03.750> underneath<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> plane

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
someone who's well underneath the plane
