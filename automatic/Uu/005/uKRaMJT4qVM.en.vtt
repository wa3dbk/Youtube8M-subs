00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.720
 that it is possible to get an egg to take the 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.850
 nucleus of oil inside of itself ovule 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.539
 place the ovum of a nucleus of a 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.210
 cell within the block and 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.070
 retrieve the multiplication potential 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.439
 You take the obvious that it's a cell. 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.349
 but with the potential of 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.759
 transform an embryonic cell 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.769
 he immediately took off and took the 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.590
 an adult cell and put in 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.989
 never imagined that this was possible 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.239
 this was the great discovery it never 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.250
 imagined that a nucleus of a cell 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.680
 adulthood could have the ability to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 provoke one to recover from doing the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.390
 opposite way of recovering 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.300
 potential of multiplying in 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 countless of them this importance 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.890
 discovery was of major importance 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.980
 because it opens up possibility of what 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.170
 we solve some kind of problem for 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.050
 which there is no technical solution in this 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.619
 moment that is the problem of regeneration 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.210
 tissues but we are increasingly 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.829
 infectious diseases 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.170
 today I am the man of 70 80 years and women 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.860
 of that age in full activity and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.899
 physical intellectual etc. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.329
 the problem the limitation of modern life 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.920
 What are some fabrics that we 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.560
 we are going to lose we are not able to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.259
 regenerate whoever loses beta cells 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.600
 of the pancreas fails to produce insulin and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.340
 diabetic who has seen a myocardial 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.619
 myocardium has a part of the muscle 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.320
 cardiac dying we know nothing 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.079
 we know how to divert the arteries and 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.600
 to ensure some circulation 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.000
 a minimum necessary circulation but not 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.960
 we can restore that tissue 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.869
 dead 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.090
 if we have cells in the laboratory 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.920
 works as a fabric factory 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.320
 this will open a perspective on the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.469
 medicine but we skated on diseases 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.270
 degenerative because we do not know 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.359
 replace tissues that have been lost 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.710
 this type of technology 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.960
 possibility 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.870
 unfortunately this started skating a 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.879
 that the discussion of when it begins 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.930
 the human life of which are the 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.579
 principles we'll never 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.700
 let's understand in these areas in this 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.859
 area because if I ask here to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.750
 this auditorium what will happen 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.969
 with us from the moment the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.790
 our heart so I'm going to hear one of 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.069
 more varied answers I will never get to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.319
 a single solution to a final solution for this 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.269
 kind of problem because it does not exist is 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.010
 In vitro fertilization is a 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.709
 highly inefficient 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.959
 the calculation is that about you and 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.069
 you have to see several embryos in the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.189
 woman's uterus 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.010
 so they can one of them at least 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.409
 pick up occasionally picked up 2003 we have 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.970
 these children who are born from pando there right? 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.669
 but it is usually very difficult 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.129
 achieve the efficiency of this method 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:02.200
 year around 1 10% on average 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.810
 It is logical that even specialists 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.389
 say that with them 30 40 50 percent 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.579
 but the average is very low then you 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.230
 first prepares several embryos for 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.049
 choose the most viable 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.629
 those that are not very viable are 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.379
 despised what they do with these 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.299
 embryos 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.099
 already the final but here I got the embryo 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.919
 I'm going to take care of life, I'll freeze and 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.709
 now throw away the vast majority plays 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.449
 those that are not very viable serve 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.519
 very well for this type of experiment 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.530
 they are not viable to be 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.449
 implanted into the uterus of a woman but 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.459
 those cells can be used as 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.400
 new fabric factory 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.729
 the rest of the embryos they choose the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.049
 more viable see and keep the 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.750
 others that are feasible and that 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.000
 can theoretically be those used 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 that go to the refrigerator can hardly 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.329
 make it viable again 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.250
 the federal board of medicine has banned 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.470
 destruction first a control nor 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.269
 nobody knows who will freeze this will stay 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.129
 frozen it here black has a cost 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.019
 to freeze and freeze during 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.479
 how much time and sometimes the couple solves 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.519
 adopt a ready child and give up 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.199
 everything that is not easy 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.900
 woman has to take hormone 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.879
 to be able to make these embryos 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.949
 there is no control nor 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.919
 knows and has an idea of ​​what happens 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.870
 they what the scientists want the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.539
 which is to get these cells 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.680
 embryos and be able to use this to 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.680
 make new fabrics
