00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to everything today a tutorial 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.450
 hairstyle personally I have very very 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 hot right now and I turn a little 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.769
 little round with the buns out of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.469
 shower or mistresses very high 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.269
 placed very high perched on the head 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.369
 so I wanted to offer you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.730
 a wreath of braids with flowers 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.680
 fresh 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.980
 if you do not have any, obviously 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 can use flowers here are 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.910
 artificial or maybe flowers 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 recover on a crown of braids 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 already bought so I start in 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 releasing some a good wick on the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.329
 on it and recovering a big wick 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.989
 of hair behind my ear and I 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.989
 make a braid 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.190
 once the braid is complete you can 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.829
 to put it back tense 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.870
 side magic how to leave on and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.619
 you fold all this on top of the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.890
 skull and you make it stand with a 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.790
 flat clip that is brought to be 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.790
 removed then 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.450
 you create the same braids of the other 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.450
 side 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.750
 and you flap it and the end has to go 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.800
 under the address under the first and you 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:50.760
 make it happen with small 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:54.680
 bun clips two are enough and for 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.540
 the other could remove the flat pliers 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 and the end of the braid goes under the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:06.300
 first is the same we make it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.070
 chignin finally with 2 clip here 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.960
 so four I think for the crown 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.140
 suffice 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.490
 that's if the heat will bother you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.810
 no more than that you can of course 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.200
 stay like that but personally I 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.100
 finish in little bun to try to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.590
 free the nick 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.850
 so he'll just have to twitch a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.890
 little bit in every way the hair 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.940
 on the back is stuck all that with 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 tweezers china 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.880
 and here I use this if environt 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.920
 if clip I'm going to put a little 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.930
 last here everything is symmetrical 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.860
 and it will be good then we must put 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.110
 the flowers I chose small 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.240
 white and purple flowers to go 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.130
 with my outfit and I put lavender 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.130
 lavender for smells 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.900
 and here I am helped by a little water 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.500
 small bun clips for 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.110
 to fit 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.030
 but that's if you if the little stems 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.370
 flowers are hard enough you can 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.019
 of course slide them between the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.750
 mesh of the braid here I hope that 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.660
 this little hairstyle this little tutorial 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.170
 quite fast and easy you will have liked 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.030
 personally I immediately 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.989
 much less hot and I can 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.000
 start my day 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.000
 good day to you all bye
