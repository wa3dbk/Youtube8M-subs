a<00:01:36.360> try<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.990> expensive<00:01:37.259> either<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
a try it was not expensive either I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
a try it was not expensive either I
tried<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> 14<00:01:38.520> day<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.820> first<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.420> I'm

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
tried the 14 day one first and now I'm

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
tried the 14 day one first and now I'm
doing<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> 28<00:01:40.439> day<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.640> second

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
doing the 28 day one actually so second

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
doing the 28 day one actually so second
time<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.150> I'm<00:01:42.540> gonna<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.960> honest<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.439> don't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
time around I'm gonna be honest I don't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
time around I'm gonna be honest I don't
think<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> necessarily<00:01:44.280> helped<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> lot

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
think that it necessarily helped a lot

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
think that it necessarily helped a lot
with<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:45.720> bloating<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.470> still<00:01:46.740> blow<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
with my bloating like I still blow but I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
with my bloating like I still blow but I
think<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.030> my<00:01:48.060> stomach<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> general

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
think it's because my stomach in general

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.410 
think it's because my stomach in general
is<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.409> sensitive<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.070> things<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is just very sensitive to things so you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.819 
is just very sensitive to things so you
know<00:01:51.450> obviously<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.200> works<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> some

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
know obviously it works about on some

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
know obviously it works about on some
people<00:01:53.040> than<00:01:53.189> other<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.360> did<00:01:54.840> help

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
people than other but it really did help

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
people than other but it really did help
with<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.439> skin<00:01:55.710> significantly<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
with my skin significantly all that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.319 
with my skin significantly all that
under<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> skin<00:01:58.469> acne<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.880> happening

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
under the skin acne that was happening

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.020 
under the skin acne that was happening
would<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.590> cured<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.009> by<00:02:02.399> anything<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
then I drank that tea and it cleared up
