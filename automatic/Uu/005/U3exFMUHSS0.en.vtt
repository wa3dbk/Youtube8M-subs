00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.769
 vitamins can be defined as 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.080
 organic components of the food that 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.559
 are necessary for the development and 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.780
 good health curiously until 150 ago 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.570
 years the world did not know exactly what 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.060
 they were or what they were for but they 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.369
 suspected of its existence for example 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.859
 the ancient Egyptians noticed that if you 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 gave liver to patients with blindness 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.230
 night was improving today we know that this 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.930
 disease is due to a deficiency of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.670
 vitamins over the centuries 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.399
 continues to observe that the lack of some 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.579
 food could cause different 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.430
 evils like scurvy the so-called evil 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.250
 of the sailors that originated by 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.550
 lack of vitamin c found in 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.550
 citrus 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.700
 It must be said that our body does not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.950
 produces the majority of vitamins that 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.320
 need for that is necessary 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.480
 consume through food and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.480
 of multivitamin supplements 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 It must be said that there are 13 vitamins 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.550
 known to b1 b2 b3 b5 b6 7 9 12 cde 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.070
 ica and are divided into two types which are 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.740
 Dissolve in water and dissolve 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 in fat those that dissolve in 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.000
 fat stay longer in our 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.760
 body and those that dissolve in 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 Water generally remain within 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.520
 We few days and go through 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.979
 the urine its functions vary 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 some are antioxidants others help 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.590
 to the growth of cells or the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 muscle tissue 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.950
 Vitamins are also vital for the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.990
 development of the fetus but because when 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 the fetus begins to grow inside the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 your mom's belly needs all the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.660
 possible nutrients is clear between them 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.960
 many vitamins that will help you create 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.610
 bones muscles and skin deficiency 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.369
 some vitamin during pregnancy 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.540
 can cause problems for the baby 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.709
 This is vital for your consumption at this stage 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.770
 curiously not all vitamins 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.070
 they are in food 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.490
 for example vitamin d is synthesized 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.050
 in our skin that is to say it is produced in 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.060
 she but needs help from the rays 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.489
 ultraviolet generated by the sun 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.370
 The ginseng er 115 is the extract 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.170
 standardized exclusive of drugs that 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.470
 it is obtained from the root of the bread 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.989
 ginseng an exclusive plant of Korea and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.450
 china with many properties 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.890
 regenerative the gene 115 of the capsules 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010
 of pharmaton helps transport 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.209
 effectively oxygen in the blood 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.550
 increasing energy production 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.650
 for better physical performance in addition 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.440
 protects the cells feeling that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.959
 deteriorate due to causes such as stress or 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.790
 poor nutrition 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.400
 there are also several myths around 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.910
 of vitamins for example some 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.489
 people say they get fat and that's 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.530
 false indeed help keep 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.560
 thin since several processes 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.170
 food and metabolic means the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.170
 who take advantage of the nutrients depend 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.040
 of vitamins the problem would be 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.099
 remove the vitamins as some do 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.870
 diets not suitable another myth says that 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.890
 the vitamins should be consumed with the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.800
 empty stomach and that is also false 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.380
 your intake is better after eating and 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.720
 even better if done in the night before 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.680
 to sleep since it is at this stage when 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.840
 the body enters catabolic state 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.540
 I explain how we entered into a kind of 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.270
 fasting for 8 hours the body needs 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.730
 keep nourishing then you can 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:56.480
 consume the vitamins that we just 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.480
 give it more quickly and efficiently
