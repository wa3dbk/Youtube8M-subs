00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello everyone with you to the rivers today as 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:19.760
 and promised to do a review on the innovation 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 maynkravt 15 I did a review on 6 total 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:29.060
 as I esteemed the most necessary and first thing 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.140
 this is a block of ezra table or 1 ton block 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 source of growth on the same as 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 red torch only its not so 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.170
 in no way can not put it out it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.680
 there is a torch can then it is not and he 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 also gives a signal in 15 blocks 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 used this block I already showed in 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 trigger well more so far nowhere 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.190
 used second mechanism is funnel 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 or copier and hopper apologizing how he 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.619
 it works we throw our stuff at it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.450
 let it be a distributor there blocks 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.410
 herbs he sends them all 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 on the chest this opera will be used 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:21.440
 in my next two mechanisms this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 mechanism up mechanisms this is a shop and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 the funnel is also in this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 sorting funnels will be 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 used such as 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.180
 innovations like a comparator about him i 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.190
 I'll tell you later this makes the sensor 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.190
 or a daylight sensor like it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.870
 it works if we have sunshine in the yard 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 let's say it works if we 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:54.490
 deliver the night example like this no no wrong 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.820
 like this 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.250
 then we will have a night of light no ie 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 a little light of course no signal 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.790
 comes in and then through denial 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 put like 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.549
 Naturally if the signal will be received 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.550
 tattoo through and press 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.880
 denial the torch will be extinguished by this 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.250
 signals and the lamp will not burn 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.580
 the next is a chest when opening 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.739
 which gives us a signal for exactly one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.180
 block here put Peter so the signal 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:29.230
 it comes to this one this this one 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.590
 a piston that is, I open the lead pieces 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.819
 the piston opens with hazelnuts that is 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.860
 signal so here it is in a comparator 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:45.430
 The comparator has two entry points for this. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.220
 here it is. would it be 1 of 2 input from by 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.850
 it also has two mod modes on its sides 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.080
 comparisons and mods do not know what to call it 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.109
 probably subtraction will tell about these two 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.380
 Mods in more detail could the comparison come from 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.380
 Togo 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.170
 So 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.420
 where the signal is more powerful that is if here 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.410
 signal stayed as far as 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.940
 another 13 blocks and then stayed at 14 on 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.820
 than will transmit a signal from here and 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.990
 here there will be 14 blocks that is 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 so 14 blocks if the signal is more powerful 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.100
 I will put an example here 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.400
 red torch 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.400
 then the signal will be transmitted 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.150
 this signal will be transmitted 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.160
 but assuming that the signal is also 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.160
 beta here on this one 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.840
 The photo also has a second mod. I donâ€™t know how 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.660
 call him call his subtraction 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.880
 because that is it switches to 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.070
 second mod he's right by pressing right 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.360
 mouse buttons and how it works 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:07.480
 here we are left with 14 blocks 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.270
 if i put that there will be 14 too 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.470
 block who 's the signal here will be the video it will 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.299
 the weak will remain 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:20.940
 14 so he does something in my general 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.940
 will not let us put porsche 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.990
 like this if I put the example like this 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.550
 then the signals will remain exactly one 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.410
 piston 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.400
 exactly one block and that is here already 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.520
 red torch will not work well I think 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.760
 he is all clear this subtraction goes then 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.810
 there is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.030
 March 2 way to work 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.720
 So I will say the last thing for you today 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.110
 show it 2 need a plate as for me so 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.120
 not 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.970
 this innovation did not like at all 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.250
 kravets but much wasted nothing usually 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.900
 I found a plate the more we step on 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.580
 nothing happens to her 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.100
 only when we put on it 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.920
 items and signal as you can see only on 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.130
 one block in my opinion it is generally like 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.830
 not profitable and things to do and not worth 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.700
 although maybe if somebody if i 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.370
 I will find on the Internet 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.370
 some mechanism is connected with 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.350
 these plates will show you naturally 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.280
 so you can see them too 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.140
 probably on this all the same from 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.420
 mechanisms to you were not clear if 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.130
 when crookedly explained how it works 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.520
 I can only write the comparator again 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.810
 refer to the comments on this all with 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.460
 you were freaks do not forget 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.700
 subscribe to my channel like 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.700
 until
