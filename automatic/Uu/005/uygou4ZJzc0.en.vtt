that's<00:02:06.390> mainly<00:02:06.630> carbs<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.860> example<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that's mainly carbs for example the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
that's mainly carbs for example the
macros<00:02:08.640> there's<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.090> serving<00:02:09.420> size<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.840> just

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
macros there's one serving size so just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.800 
macros there's one serving size so just
nice<00:02:10.229> serving<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.310> serving<00:02:11.640> size<00:02:11.819> kinda

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
nice serving you know serving size kinda

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
then five grams of protein that's for

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.449 
then five grams of protein that's for
the<00:02:20.579> chicken<00:02:21.329> flavor<00:02:21.540> one<00:02:22.040> those<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.250> anyone's

the chicken flavor one those on anyone's

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.459 
the chicken flavor one those on anyone's
gonna<00:02:23.549> be<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.849> similar<00:02:24.120> 2.5<00:02:24.930> grams<00:02:25.079> of<00:02:25.319> fat

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
gonna be really similar 2.5 grams of fat

44 grams of carbs and then seven grams
of<00:02:28.500> protein<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.189> this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.609> much<00:02:29.730> my

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
of protein so this is pretty much my

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.539 
of protein so this is pretty much my
carbon<00:02:30.389> source<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.709> add<00:02:31.859> water<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
carbon source I just add water and I

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.190 
carbon source I just add water and I
microwave<00:02:33.060> these<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.629> said<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.870> don't<00:02:34.049> need

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
these are really good I've eaten these

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.399 
these are really good I've eaten these
before<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.939> natural<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:55.169> hundred

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
before this is natural one hundred

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.459 
before this is natural one hundred
percent<00:02:55.439> natty<00:02:55.919> doesn't<00:02:56.370> take<00:02:56.489> creatine

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
percent natty doesn't take creatine

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.490

white<00:02:58.469> chicken<00:02:59.010> cuts<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.230> even

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
white chicken cuts so this it's even

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.809 
white chicken cuts so this it's even
seasoned<00:03:01.829> with<00:03:01.980> sea<00:03:02.159> salt<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.669> is<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
seasoned with sea salt so this is a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:03.920 
seasoned with sea salt so this is a
little<00:03:02.849> more<00:03:03.180> expensive<00:03:03.359> it's<00:03:03.659> really<00:03:03.810> not

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
little more expensive it's really not

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
little more expensive it's really not
bad<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.469> per<00:03:05.040> bag<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.609> pretty<00:03:05.790> much<00:03:05.879> what<00:03:06.090> my

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
bad but per bag so pretty much what my

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.390 
bad but per bag so pretty much what my
plan<00:03:06.569> on<00:03:06.689> doing<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.139> adding<00:03:07.349> some<00:03:07.560> water<00:03:07.590> boom

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
plan on doing is adding some water boom

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.759 
plan on doing is adding some water boom
microwaving<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.349> pouring

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
microwaving this and then just pouring

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.339 
microwaving this and then just pouring
this<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.159> there<00:03:11.489> with<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.939> as<00:03:12.930> far<00:03:12.989> as<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
this in there with it as far as the

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.099 
this in there with it as far as the
chicken<00:03:13.650> goes<00:03:13.769> now<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.189> one<00:03:14.430> bag<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.900> one

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
chicken goes now I have one bag so one

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.289 
chicken goes now I have one bag so one
bag<00:03:16.349> has<00:03:16.620> about<00:03:17.280> three<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.669> half<00:03:17.729> servings

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
bag has about three and a half servings

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.069 
bag has about three and a half servings
so<00:03:18.510> we're<00:03:18.959> actually<00:03:19.049> going<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.349> get<00:03:19.500> around

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
so we're actually going to get around

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.659 
so we're actually going to get around
seven<00:03:22.079> grams<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.470> fat<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.040> we're<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.639> to

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
seven grams of fat and we're going to

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.129 
seven grams of fat and we're going to
get<00:03:23.849> around<00:03:25.669> about<00:03:26.669> 45<00:03:27.269> grams<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.750> protein<00:03:27.900> per

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
get around about 45 grams of protein per

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.020 
get around about 45 grams of protein per
this<00:03:28.530> bag<00:03:28.799> plus<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.549> get<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.729> approach<00:03:29.879> in

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this bag plus we get the approach in

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.629 
this bag plus we get the approach in
there<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.329> mean<00:03:30.510> we're<00:03:30.599> getting<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:30.959> 40

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
there so I mean we're getting about 40

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.059 
there so I mean we're getting about 40

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
what i like to do there's a bunch of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.879 
what i like to do there's a bunch of
different<00:04:12.870> options<00:04:13.319> i'll<00:04:13.409> make<00:04:13.560> more<00:04:13.680> videos

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
different options i'll make more videos

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.679 
different options i'll make more videos
but<00:04:14.129> this<00:04:14.189> is<00:04:14.310> definitely<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.759> go-to<00:04:15.000> it's

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
but this is definitely a go-to it's

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.390 
but this is definitely a go-to it's
still<00:04:15.959> fairly<00:04:16.169> cheap<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.769> cheaper<00:04:17.220> than<00:04:17.340> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
still fairly cheap it is cheaper than a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.460 
still fairly cheap it is cheaper than a
meal<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.659> think<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.139> three<00:04:19.380> or

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
meal and so I think it's like three or

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.469 
meal and so I think it's like three or
four<00:04:19.500> bucks<00:04:19.889> for<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.579> whole<00:04:20.759> thing<00:04:20.789> I<00:04:21.269> mean

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
four bucks for the whole thing I mean

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.790 
four bucks for the whole thing I mean
