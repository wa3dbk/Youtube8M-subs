 paper 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.410
 before customizing I decided 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.510
 to cook them in order to obtain 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.870
 hard-boiled eggs you can find our 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.230

 once to customize, we have nothing left 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.030
 more than waiting for the eggs to dry
