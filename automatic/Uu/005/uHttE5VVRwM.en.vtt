00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the big controversy here is that the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
the big controversy here is that the
when<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.469> originally<00:00:34.829> like

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
when it was it was originally like

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.069 
when it was it was originally like
novels<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> animators<00:00:36.600> decided<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
novels and when the animators decided is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.090 
novels and when the animators decided is
how<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.770> decided<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
how to make it they decided to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
how to make it they decided to
explicitly<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> characters<00:00:39.390> ines<00:00:39.570> look

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
explicitly make the characters ines look

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
explicitly make the characters ines look
very<00:00:40.320> mo<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> repeals<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> current<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
very mo a so it repeals the current of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
very mo a so it repeals the current of
taco<00:00:42.660> audience<00:00:45.079> I'm<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.649> too<00:00:46.860> worried<00:00:47.129> about

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
taco audience I'm not too worried about

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.500 
taco audience I'm not too worried about
that<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.730> frankly<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that because frankly it's just the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
that because frankly it's just the
visual<00:00:48.660> representation<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.500> anyway<00:00:50.010> we'll

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
visual representation but anyway we'll

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.930 
visual representation but anyway we'll
talk<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:55.460> basic<00:00:56.460> premise

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
talk about that in a bit basic premise

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.680 
talk about that in a bit basic premise
is<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.469> all-girl<00:00:59.690> squadron

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
the direction in general is i would say

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.319 
the direction in general is i would say
going<00:03:43.190> more<00:03:43.370> for<00:03:43.400> clarity<00:03:43.730> than<00:03:44.150> for

going more for clarity than for
experimentation<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.380> is<00:03:45.470> not<00:03:45.590> baka

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
experimentation this is not baka

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.220 
experimentation this is not baka
monogatari<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:47.480> i<00:03:49.690> would<00:03:50.690> say<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.049> sort

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
monogatari but i would say it's it sort

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.430 
monogatari but i would say it's it sort
of<00:03:51.290> middle<00:03:52.130> ground<00:03:52.220> between<00:03:52.780> drab<00:03:53.780> anime

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and clean surprisingly so actually as

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.789 
and clean surprisingly so actually as
its<00:04:11.630> kind<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.840> cinematic<00:04:12.260> field<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.590> do<00:04:12.680> that

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
its kind of cinematic field to do that

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.770 
its kind of cinematic field to do that
editing<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:15.200> general<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.609> characters
