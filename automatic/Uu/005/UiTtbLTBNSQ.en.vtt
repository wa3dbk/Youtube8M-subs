progression and as you can see of course

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.619 
progression and as you can see of course
there<00:06:06.409> is<00:06:06.529> the<00:06:06.560> base<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.819> comes<00:06:08.029> with<00:06:08.240> them<00:06:08.389> I

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
there is the base that comes with them I

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.180 
there is the base that comes with them I
know<00:06:09.319> that<00:06:09.500> there's<00:06:09.650> a<00:06:09.710> number<00:06:09.889> of<00:06:10.009> different

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
chopper figures and I actually probably

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.779 
chopper figures and I actually probably

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
up because although it is smaller it was

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.100 
up because although it is smaller it was
something<00:06:49.400> that<00:06:49.430> I<00:06:49.520> paid<00:06:50.089> considerably<00:06:50.569> less

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
something that I paid considerably less

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.260 
something that I paid considerably less
than<00:06:51.500> I<00:06:51.529> have<00:06:51.830> for<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.580> other<00:06:52.699> figures<00:06:53.089> that

of<00:07:10.290> these<00:07:10.380> to<00:07:10.680> expand<00:07:11.190> my<00:07:11.430> collection<00:07:11.490> over

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
of these to expand my collection over

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.420 
of these to expand my collection over
here<00:07:12.440> and<00:07:13.440> I<00:07:13.620> just<00:07:13.800> thought<00:07:13.860> it<00:07:14.010> was<00:07:14.100> kind<00:07:14.220> of<00:07:14.310> a

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
here and I just thought it was kind of a

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.640 
here and I just thought it was kind of a
funny<00:07:14.640> goofy<00:07:15.390> overkill<00:07:16.050> that<00:07:16.200> they<00:07:16.320> did<00:07:16.500> with

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
funny goofy overkill that they did with

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.740 
funny goofy overkill that they did with
that<00:07:16.680> box<00:07:17.070> sending<00:07:17.880> this<00:07:18.000> tiny<00:07:18.300> little<00:07:18.480> box

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
that box sending this tiny little box

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.420 
that box sending this tiny little box
packed<00:07:19.200> in<00:07:19.350> that<00:07:19.470> giant<00:07:19.710> box<00:07:20.070> and<00:07:20.310> from

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430
