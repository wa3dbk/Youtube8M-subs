00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.020
 It's okay, we're on our course. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.740
 mathematics is the continuation of the 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:19.619
 we know from the antenou that 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:23.789
 potentiation potentiation is one thing 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:39.899
 such as with the medium to high in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:40.559
 group in which the poet is the basis of my 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 drink 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 You'll see that you're exposing my right in a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.710
 day 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:01.100
 think about the base you have 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.100
 therefore we times then 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 knowing only that it was worth the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.810
 Ours very great for example if we 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 we had here 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.790
 7 is taken to the floor number quite 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.200
 great 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:26.580
 the sevens would go from the toucans that I am here 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 the base and a mall and would be the exponent 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.780
 fool called power probably 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.009
 power the effect is for example we 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.330
 we have to know if the basis is 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.820
 taken to 0 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.640
 By setting our course here we 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.310
 will say that here is everything 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.450
 so everybody's everybody goes to zero 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.910
 balls 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.479
 including the brain is brought to 0 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.680
 We're going to say that he talks in order. 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.990
 perfect staff 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.039
 remember very well this that will me 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.039
 to serve the exercises 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.950
 we have the situation here who seems to say 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.230
 Now the high - alley 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.540
 Let's prove anything here but you will. 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:25.750
 to fix that the wing eva friends of angola 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.160
 Doha universe is taken to a kiss because 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.359
 is to participate and lead to God 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.799
 it happens to simple people 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:38.519
 simply exchange the sign of the acre 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.299
 negative and does because that signal is 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.680
 in 11 types of conjunctivitis 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:50.400
 therefore the high - p nor put on 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 has since raised a practical example 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.900
 what we could do 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:02.829
 represents 2 is taken - 37 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:09.110
 whenever you take care you risk saying 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:11.829
 2222 would be worth some good until 1998 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.829
 that negative on the saw to maturity 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.829
 equal 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.379
 on the high to 3 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:37.690
 is equal to 2 x 3 times December 28 of 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:42.340
 2012 by tato night from the two months 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.340
 hence the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:53.880
 on Wii xuxa opened our response 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.620
 which is not about the perfectly 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.980
 here is another one that this is a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:08.340
 a little maybe an understanding looks 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:11.790
 than high of yen about defect 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.130
 They understand it to be different. 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.180
 not to have a division so that's 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:23.610
 here is the same as looking at the saves us oa 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.700
 inside the radical 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.840
 You pass by and the baby stops. 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.590
 treatment is done only then went from 16 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.520
 years 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.610
 the delegate being designed to insert you 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.350
 You should take the car here, right? 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:49.840
 You and I would pass on here and there . 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.640
 would score that without this rule 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.450
 it will be of great importance for 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.330
 Jesus 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:00.199
 then for example three and takes water two 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.790
 chemical 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.500
 I would know what to be epal us 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:14.040
 perceive the passage within the local frame 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.740
 15 I'd come here not to follow this 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.330
 rule that your pass to here and 2 that is the 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.449
 well passes inside 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.540
 markers and only I feel is in a way 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.960
 more simplified let's do it the way 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:34.020
 I wanted to apologize and three times 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:37.580
 three would give new that is the answer to the 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.580
 our latin party 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:48.389
 we'll have it there 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.949
 I love people , well, that's what we had. 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.710
 for the moment 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.110
 thank you the tension continues to evaluate 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.600
 our channel 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.600
 send suggestions even further
