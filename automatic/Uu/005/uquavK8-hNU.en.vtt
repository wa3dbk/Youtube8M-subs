ABBY CADABBY: Hello!

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:06.140
ELMO: Oh, Abby and Elmo are

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.060
your teeth.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.805
ELMO: What?

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:10.380
ABBY CADABBY: I don't
have any teeth.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.830
See?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.180
Ah.

ELMO: No.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.300
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, Elmo, how are
we gonna show how to brush

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.447
teeth if we don't
have any teeth?

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:24.818
Um, magic?

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:26.190
ELMO: No, no.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.280
Not magic, Abby.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.234
We can imagine have teeth and
pretend to brush them.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:32.509
ABBY CADABBY: OK.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.430
I'm imagining I have teeth.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.930
ELMO: So is Elmo.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.915
Now, let's pretend to brush
them with our imaginary

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:42.885
toothbrush.

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:43.490
ABBY CADABBY: Oh.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.446
OK.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.358
Um, all right.

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:47.620
Now what do we do, Elmo?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.790
ELMO: Well, we put imaginary
toothpaste like this.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.150
We put imaginary toothpaste
on our toothbrushes.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.910
Squeeze, squeeze, but
just a little.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.420
ABBY CADABBY: OK.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.110

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.620
ABBY CADABBY: All right.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.040
Um, uh, squeeze, squeeze.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.518
OK.

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:04.474
ELMO: OK.

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:06.386
Now, brush.

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:10.750
Up and down, up and down, round
and round and round and

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.150
round, up and down,
up and down.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.620
ABBY CADABBY: Down,
around, and round.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.880
ELMO: And make sure you get
every tooth-- front and back.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.420
ABBY CADABBY: OK.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.032
Every tooth, front and back.

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:28.750
ELMO: Time to rinse.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.992
Oh, Abby, do you have your
imaginary cup of water?

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.800
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, yep.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.566

ELMO: Good.

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:35.580
ABBY CADABBY: Let's rinse.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.664
ELMO: OK.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:41.060
[IMAGINARY GARGLING]

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.940
ELMO: Again!

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.694
[GARGLING]

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:49.110
[LAUGHING]

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.470
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, Elmo,
let's brush again.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.430
ELMO: OK, Abby.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.750

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:56.380
ELMO: Huh?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.590
ABBY CADABBY: Pretending

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.490
ELMO: Yeah.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.740
