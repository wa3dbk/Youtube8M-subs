00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to unboxing this now you're wondering

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
to unboxing this now you're wondering
why<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:33.059> macbook

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
why I need this is for my macbook

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.080 
why I need this is for my macbook
because<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.140> need<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.920> space<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:38.579> think

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because I need more space and I think

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.380 
because I need more space and I think
that<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.950> 500<00:00:40.950> gigabyte<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.879> enough<00:00:42.360> for

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that this is 500 gigabyte are enough for

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:54.889 
that this is 500 gigabyte are enough for
me<00:00:49.399> opening<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> box<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> what

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
me opening the box here and this is what

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.490 
me opening the box here and this is what
we<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.050> around<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.690> just<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> pull

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
we have around it just going to pull

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
we have around it just going to pull
this<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> box<00:01:00.260> carefully<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> before

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this out of the box carefully and before

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
this out of the box carefully and before
we<00:01:03.059> unpackage<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.930> let's<00:01:04.170> leave<00:01:04.439> what's<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we unpackage this let's leave what's in

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.130 
we unpackage this let's leave what's in
the<00:01:05.100> box<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.689> western<00:01:07.350> digital<00:01:07.610> i

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
the box we have a western digital i

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.060 
the box we have a western digital i
guess<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:11.000> papers<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.860> we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
guess this is just papers and then we

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.120 
guess this is just papers and then we
have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.689> instruction<00:01:15.689> guide<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.290> how<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> set

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have a instruction guide on how to set

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.230 
have a instruction guide on how to set
it<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.900> mac<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.439> pc<00:01:19.880> which<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> good

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it up to your mac or pc which is good

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320 
it up to your mac or pc which is good
and<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and that's basically it that's in the

off here it is the my book western
digital<00:01:33.000> itself<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.479> our<00:01:36.960> AC<00:01:37.770> wall

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
digital itself and we have our AC wall

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.840 
digital itself and we have our AC wall
charger<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:39.210> believe<00:01:39.920> yes<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.140> have

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
charger i believe yes and then we have

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
charger i believe yes and then we have
our<00:01:45.950> USB<00:01:47.600> good<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.950> basically<00:01:50.189> and
