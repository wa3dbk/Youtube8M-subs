00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.809
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.269
 super good sorry I could not do them 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.340
 a video before but I was in week of 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.170
 exams today I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.270
 blog where I'm going to show you the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.810
 products that I almost always use almost 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.300
 daily 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.880
 I answer the same questions of where 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.130
 I get the tag and what brand does it use in 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.810
 where did you buy all this 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.910
 then it becomes more practical 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.610
 make a video and answer them all 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.440
 at the same time so I brought them to a 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.390
 from my favorite stores of products 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.690
 organic where he bought most of my 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.570
 things and I'm going to tell you what products 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.430
 use and what I recommend and does not have 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 to be exactly these brands 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.559
 people that I like the best 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.379
 let's start with the tajín this brand 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.920
 it's called natural new world that is my 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.020
 favorite and they have toasted and raw tahini 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.969
 I like it better in toasted I feel that 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.559
 has more flavor and that's the one 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 I usually buy everything 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.479
 time but when I do not find I like it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.050
 the brand that is what I think is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.530
 which is firm 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.850
 and if this Canadian brand is not also me 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.940
 like and buy it once it's called 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.980
 better the stevia brand that I use is this 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.830
 direction is what I use that is organic 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.560
 but they also have other flavors and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.360
 they have this one that is alcohol-free but 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 I prefer that you bank a little bit 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.520
 of alcohol and that are armed for oats 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.870
 that is gluten-free this is the brand that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.090
 I bought him a lot 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.490
 and what I do is that he bought the villages 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 and nothing more 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.009
 flight and I pass them through a colander and so on 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.780
 I make my flour really oatmeal and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.689
 they have to look for this sign that they say 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 gluten and because they usually see them 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.729
 acidic and contains gluten another very good 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.549
 is of the boxer ethnicity brand that I consume 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.009
 a lot of your products and how you can see 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.710
 here also says winfrey then this 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.799
 is another option and from the same brand of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.289
 bots training is the chickpea flour 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.019
 that I use for my guts for my hot 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.209
 cakes and is already available 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.209
 in Mexico and then all of us and Canada 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.010
 this is the flour all purpose put 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.230
 for the brownies for my banana bread 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.630
 for almost all the desserts I make 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.810
 baked this is my favorite flour that 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.670
 it's also from the boxing red mark and this one 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.920
 I tell you that there is super easy 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.950
 find it in Mexico and then in almost 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.200
 all sides when as spices always 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.470
 I look for the always organic brand that is 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.900
 the cinnamon I use is this and also its 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.440
 turmeric I like a lot and nothing is that they are 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.140
 of very good quality this obviously if 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.210
 it's a bit expensive but it's very 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.130
 good quality and the spices that last 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.959
 a lot then it's not something that you have to 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.640
 be buying so much 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.459
 tamariz that he always mentioned and I use a lot 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.880
 for sushi and it 's my liking 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.880
 to buy 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 is the organic and you find him in almost 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.390
 all supermarkets great brand that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.850
 quinoa use of quinoa paste from this 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.400
 it's called angie greens and it's very easy 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.920
 to find but with a paste 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.710
 of quinoa or corn or brown rice 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.950
 are the best actions and that what 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.230
 find in your area but not from 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.840
 wheat or that you very withdraw this is the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.970
 smoked tofu brand that bought that already 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.730
 It has enough to not buy one 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.790
 Really delicious that you are super rich and 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.930
 this one is called soy k nick and it's the same 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.930
 brand that bought bread 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 because remember that soy is one of the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.110
 more genetic foods 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.569
 so you have to make sure good friends 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.090
 I hope that this trip through the super 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.610
 have served to have an idea that 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.769
 I like to use products I do not know 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.019
 They have to limit what these brands 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.360
 find that is the most important thing what 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.370
 what we want is to eat healthy then 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.680
 it does not have to be exactly that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.780
 brand but nothing else so they know if 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.150
 come to see those names that are the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 that I recommend and if they have any 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.870
 Ask any suggestion, you know 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.360
 that can leave a comment 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.760
 I hope you find it very useful to share what 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.830
 with people who believe that I can 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.180
 serve if they have family members living in 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.800
 USA or in Canada this in Monterrey or in 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.720
 cities a little bigger than already 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.539
 have these kinds of brands I think that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.669

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.830
