00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and tremolo on both channels so I'm

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490

of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> righto<00:01:34.140> channel<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
of the righto channel I'm kind of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
of the righto channel I'm kind of
balancing<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.119> both<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> them<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.049> some

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
balancing the both of them for some

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.760 
balancing the both of them for some
extra<00:01:38.250> tonal<00:01:38.670> options<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> mod<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.590> had

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
extra tonal options the mod that i had

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
extra tonal options the mod that i had
done<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.430> reversed<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> face<00:01:42.270> between

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
done also reversed the face between

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
done also reversed the face between
channels<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.619> run<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:43.979> phasing

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
channels so i don't run into phasing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
channels so i don't run into phasing
problems<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.750> i<00:01:45.799> jumper<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540
