Simon<00:05:09.599> I<00:05:09.810> think<00:05:10.470> people<00:05:10.830> often<00:05:11.010> wonder

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
Simon I think people often wonder

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.770 
Simon I think people often wonder
whether<00:05:11.880> an<00:05:12.870> actor<00:05:13.410> is<00:05:14.090> using<00:05:15.090> himself<00:05:15.570> and

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
whether an actor is using himself and

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.180 
whether an actor is using himself and
the<00:05:15.840> character<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.380> I<00:05:16.470> think<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.800> answer<00:05:17.160> is

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the character and I think the answer is

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.390 
the character and I think the answer is
to<00:05:17.580> some<00:05:18.240> extent<00:05:18.270> he<00:05:18.810> has<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.500> one<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.310> the

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
things that's missing from a lot of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.339 
things that's missing from a lot of
video<00:05:22.950> games<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:23.580> is<00:05:24.360> good<00:05:24.690> writing<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.139> good

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.580 
voice work I mean they require that it's
just<00:05:27.510> because<00:05:27.750> they're<00:05:27.900> video<00:05:28.169> games<00:05:28.410> doesn't
