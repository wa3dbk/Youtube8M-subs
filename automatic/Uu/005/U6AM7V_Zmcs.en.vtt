00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
especially considering that as just each

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.540 
especially considering that as just each
team<00:00:39.690> battle<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.800> keeps<00:00:41.010> getting<00:00:41.280> more

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
team battle it just keeps getting more

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and more difficult for them I kind of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.600 
and more difficult for them I kind of
feel<00:00:43.559> sorry<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.070> them<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.219> they've

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
feel sorry for them because they've

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
feel sorry for them because they've
executed<00:00:44.969> everything<00:00:45.510> pretty<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
executed everything pretty pretty well I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
executed everything pretty pretty well I
mean<00:00:47.129> except<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:48.260> interesting<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
mean except for that interesting use of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
mean except for that interesting use of
early<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> Croma<00:00:50.280> con<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.239> kind<00:00:51.570> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
early in a Croma con which was kind of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
early in a Croma con which was kind of
ineffective<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.620> pugna<00:00:53.039> despite<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.949> they

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
ineffective by pugna despite that they

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.180 
ineffective by pugna despite that they
just<00:00:56.129> had<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.520> many<00:00:56.640> weapons<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.270> they've

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
just had so many weapons that they've

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.069 
just had so many weapons that they've
such<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> well-formulated<00:00:59.879> strategy<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
such a well-formulated strategy that the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.130 
such a well-formulated strategy that the
clearly<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.770> planned<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.280> advance<00:01:02.670> um<00:01:03.140> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
clearly they planned in advance um and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.760 
clearly they planned in advance um and
practiced<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.689> it's<00:01:06.689> getting<00:01:06.900> demolished

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
practiced and it's getting demolished

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
practiced and it's getting demolished

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.440 

somehow<00:01:24.810> LGD<00:01:25.799> responded<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> onto<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> lgd

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
somehow LGD responded and onto the lgd

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
somehow LGD responded and onto the lgd
is<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> best<00:01:28.049> teams<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> world

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is one of the best teams in the world

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.030 
is one of the best teams in the world
right<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.850> um<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> would

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
right now so um it's it's what you would

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.539 
right now so um it's it's what you would
expect<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:34.619> racks<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.369> down

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
expect this racks is gonna go down

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
expect this racks is gonna go down
without<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:36.119> trouble<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.079> it's<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> ton<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
without any trouble so it's a ton of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.190 
without any trouble so it's a ton of
arrows<00:01:40.740> coming<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.869> about<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
arrows coming out of you think about it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.520 
arrows coming out of you think about it
it's<00:01:44.240> total<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.439> twelve<00:01:46.439> arrows<00:01:48.530> it's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it's total of twelve arrows it's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.749 
it's total of twelve arrows it's
actually<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.829> lot<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.070> than<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually a lot more than that if you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
actually a lot more than that if you
consider<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> illusion<00:01:52.140> split

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
consider that all the illusion split

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.300 
consider that all the illusion split
shot

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.800 

or<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.610> guess<00:01:59.640> that's<00:02:00.030> including<00:02:00.450> split

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
or I mean I guess that's including split

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020 
or I mean I guess that's including split
shot<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.740> now<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.580> we<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.880> watch

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
shot but all right now if we just watch

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.780 
shot but all right now if we just watch
Medusa<00:02:03.570> Medusa<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> grab<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
Medusa Medusa it's going to grab a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.609 
Medusa Medusa it's going to grab a
ton<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> kills<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.200> battle

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ton to kills right now if this battle

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.760 
ton to kills right now if this battle
plays<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.280> doesn't<00:02:09.500> she<00:02:10.500> might<00:02:10.649> have

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
plays out it doesn't she might have

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650 
plays out it doesn't she might have
actually<00:02:10.890> gone<00:02:11.190> down<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.660> considering

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
actually gone down if considering

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.350 
actually gone down if considering

particularly<00:05:12.770> from<00:05:13.070> LGD<00:05:13.430> pushing<00:05:14.120> off<00:05:14.240> what<00:05:14.540> I

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570

unstoppable<00:05:15.560> team<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:18.110> home<00:05:18.140> would<00:05:18.380> put

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
unstoppable team that a home would put

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.430 
unstoppable team that a home would put
