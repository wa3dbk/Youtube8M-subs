okay<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.049> standard<00:00:07.500> definition

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
okay it's a standard definition

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay it's a standard definition
satellite<00:00:08.519> receiver<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.900> made<00:00:10.110> by

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
satellite receiver and it's made by

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.930 
satellite receiver and it's made by
Tecna<00:00:10.650> mate<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:10.980> you're<00:00:11.099> very<00:00:11.280> famous<00:00:11.580> cut

the technology company from the UK to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
the technology company from the UK to
make<00:00:13.860> probably<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.730> best<00:00:14.820> satellite

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
make probably some of the best satellite

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.880 
make probably some of the best satellite
receivers<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> world<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
receivers in the world and this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680 
receivers in the world and this
particular<00:00:17.130> box<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> cheapest<00:00:18.600> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
particular box here is the cheapest in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.330 
particular box here is the cheapest in
the<00:00:18.779> range<00:00:19.109> ok<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> lowest<00:00:19.949> cost<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the range ok the lowest cost in the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.099 
the range ok the lowest cost in the
range<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.150> competing<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.930> very

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
range and it's competing in a very very

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.570 
range and it's competing in a very very
competitive<00:00:22.500> standard<00:00:23.070> definition

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
competitive standard definition

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.670 
competitive standard definition
satellite<00:00:23.970> receiver<00:00:24.330> market<00:00:24.689> ok<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
satellite receiver market ok and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.620 
satellite receiver market ok and
probably<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> closest<00:00:26.760> competitor<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
probably the closest competitor to this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.620 
probably the closest competitor to this
particular<00:00:27.900> box<00:00:28.260> would<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.429> Tri<00:00:30.179> access

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
particular box would be the Tri access

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
particular box would be the Tri access
r110<00:00:31.250> okay<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> has<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> few<00:00:33.719> features

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
r110 okay because it has a few features

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
r110 okay because it has a few features
on<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.320> most<00:00:34.590> boxes<00:00:34.920> won't<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.370> okay<00:00:35.730> so

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
on it that most boxes won't have okay so

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.549 
on it that most boxes won't have okay so
basically<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> lot<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
basically we have a lot to do here is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically we have a lot to do here is
I'm<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.860> gonna<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.190> off<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> give<00:00:38.700> an

have here is we have an lnb which is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
have here is we have an lnb which is
satellite<00:00:57.600> feed<00:00:57.930> input<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.530> we've<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.190> RCA

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
satellite feed input here we've an RCA

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
satellite feed input here we've an RCA
input<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> sort<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> white<00:01:01.829> red<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
input here and sort of white red and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
input here and sort of white red and
yellow<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.629> feed<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
yellow can feed in there and this can be

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
yellow can feed in there and this can be
used<00:01:05.070> feed<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.880> RCA<00:01:06.180> lead<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> two

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
used feed with an RCA lead we have two

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.679 
used feed with an RCA lead we have two
scared<00:01:07.619> outputs<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.640> escaped<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
scared outputs so we have escaped and to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
scared outputs so we have escaped and to
feed<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> TV<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> feed<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> VCR

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
feed the TV and also the feed to a VCR

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
feed the TV and also the feed to a VCR
so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> record<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.930> outputs<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so you can record the outputs from this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.149 
so you can record the outputs from this
box<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.450> rs-232<00:01:16.159> typically

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
box and you have an rs-232 typically

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
box and you have an rs-232 typically

from<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> master<00:01:22.290> box<00:01:22.680> okay<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.939> an

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
from a master box okay we have an

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
from a master box okay we have an
antenna<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.110> feeding<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> subtle

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
antenna in which we're feeding a subtle

our TV erial in and a modulator to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
our TV erial in and a modulator to
combine<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> output<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.549> box<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.540> the

combine the output of this box into the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
combine the output of this box into the
air<00:01:30.780> peas<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> relatively<00:01:32.460> unusual

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
air peas and that's a relatively unusual

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.840 
air peas and that's a relatively unusual
feature<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.689> box<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.340> most<00:01:35.340> boxes<00:01:35.729> don't

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
feature of this box and most boxes don't

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.480 
feature of this box and most boxes don't
have<00:01:36.150> modulator<00:01:37.110> anymore<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.460> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
have modulator anymore because it's just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.999

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
ok and we make sure the power button is
on<00:03:01.300> which<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:02.020> all<00:03:02.320> right<00:03:02.380> we'll<00:03:03.190> just

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
on which it is here all right we'll just

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.010 
on which it is here all right we'll just
get<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.610> here<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.330> we<00:03:04.390> just<00:03:04.450> harness<00:03:04.690> pops

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
get this here and we just harness pops

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.140 
get this here and we just harness pops
around<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.340> see<00:03:09.490> it<00:03:09.730> comes<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:10.030> at<00:03:10.120> a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
around and we see it comes up at a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.700 
around and we see it comes up at a
techni<00:03:10.450> man<00:03:10.600> here<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.350> batteries

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
techni man here that the batteries

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.470 
techni man here that the batteries
already<00:03:11.860> installed<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.460> this<00:03:12.670> now<00:03:13.360> an

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
already installed in this now an

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.910 
already installed in this now an
interesting<00:03:13.750> thing<00:03:14.020> about<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.350> box<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.740> it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
interesting thing about this box is it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.910 
interesting thing about this box is it
comes<00:03:15.160> fully<00:03:15.490> pre-programmed<00:03:16.240> ok<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.590> if<00:03:17.800> we

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
comes fully pre-programmed ok so if we

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.230 
comes fully pre-programmed ok so if we
actually<00:03:18.100> come<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> look<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.940> channel

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
actually come and look at the channel

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.720 
actually come and look at the channel
list<00:03:19.360> here<00:03:19.630> if<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:20.650> go<00:03:20.800> at<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:20.980> top<00:03:21.160> end<00:03:21.400> we<00:03:21.610> can

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
list here if we go at the top end we can

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.480 
list here if we go at the top end we can
actually<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.330> becomes<00:03:22.960> a<00:03:23.130> 253<00:03:24.130> China's

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
actually see becomes a 253 China's

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.820 
actually see becomes a 253 China's
pre-programmed<00:03:25.330> now<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:26.110> thing<00:03:26.380> about<00:03:26.470> this

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
pre-programmed now one thing about this

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.550 
pre-programmed now one thing about this
and<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.880> most<00:03:28.420> ways<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.870> fantastic<00:03:29.470> idea

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
and in most ways this fantastic idea

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.920 
and in most ways this fantastic idea
that<00:03:29.920> comes<00:03:30.160> pre-programmed<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.300> way<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
that comes pre-programmed the one way it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.780 
that comes pre-programmed the one way it
can<00:03:32.080> possibly<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.530> carful<00:03:32.980> carrying<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.400> if

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
can possibly be carful carrying is if

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.250 
can possibly be carful carrying is if
just<00:03:34.120> frequency<00:03:34.570> change<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.050> particular

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
just frequency change in a particular

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.680 
just frequency change in a particular
channel<00:03:35.740> in<00:03:36.400> between<00:03:36.460> mozilla<00:03:37.180> box<00:03:37.420> has<00:03:37.540> been

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
channel in between mozilla box has been

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.350 
channel in between mozilla box has been
programmed<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:38.400> before<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.520> purchase<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.940> so

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
programmed and before you purchase it so

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.790 
programmed and before you purchase it so
you<00:03:40.660> know<00:03:40.750> before<00:03:40.960> Christmas<00:03:41.500> Day<00:03:41.710> in

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
you know before Christmas Day in

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.460 
you know before Christmas Day in
November<00:03:42.360> 2010<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.630> frequency<00:03:43.960> changes<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
November 2010 this frequency changes and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.050 
November 2010 this frequency changes and
the<00:03:44.530> BBC<00:03:44.830> channels<00:03:45.370> things<00:03:45.520> like<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.730> so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the BBC channels things like that so

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.430 
the BBC channels things like that so
that's<00:03:46.120> just<00:03:46.330> one<00:03:46.510> issue<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.930> aware<00:03:47.110> of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
that's just one issue to be aware of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
that's just one issue to be aware of
but<00:03:47.620> generally<00:03:48.010> anyway<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.430> not<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.610> huge

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
but generally anyway it's not a huge

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.330 
but generally anyway it's not a huge
problem<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:50.410> know<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:50.920> possible

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
problem and you know and it is possible

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.830 
problem and you know and it is possible
to<00:03:51.430> manually<00:03:51.700> reach<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.090> in<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.270> box<00:03:52.450> and
