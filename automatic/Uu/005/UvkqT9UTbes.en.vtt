00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
finish driving then you can stand up in

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.840 
finish driving then you can stand up in
the<00:02:31.790> cab<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.390> without<00:02:33.200> right<00:02:33.709> yes<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.730> do

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
the cab and without right yes and to do

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.840 
the cab and without right yes and to do
for<00:02:35.000> your<00:02:35.120> back<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.050> access<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.850> payload

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
for your back you can access the payload

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.220 
for your back you can access the payload
there<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.390> hop<00:02:38.630> out<00:02:38.780> either<00:02:38.959> side

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
there then you hop out either side

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.040 
there then you hop out either side
that's<00:02:39.770> that's<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:40.670> good<00:02:41.000> design

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that's that's the really good design

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.860 
that's that's the really good design
as<00:02:44.040> most<00:02:44.460> design<00:02:44.940> team<00:02:45.180> came<00:02:45.420> from<00:02:45.570> London

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
as most design team came from London

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
as most design team came from London
taxis<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.590> obviously<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:47.100> there<00:02:47.640> are

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
taxis and obviously right there are

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.640 
taxis and obviously right there are
similarities<00:02:48.420> between<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.050> vehicle<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.530> this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
similarities between a vehicle like this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.220 
similarities between a vehicle like this
designed<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.610> deliveries<00:02:51.210> in<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.990> city

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
designed for deliveries in that city

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
designed for deliveries in that city
environment<00:02:52.530> yeah<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.550> taxi<00:02:54.120> which<00:02:54.270> is

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
environment yeah and a taxi which is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.810 
environment yeah and a taxi which is
designed<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.900> exactly<00:02:55.620> delivery<00:02:56.340> people<00:02:56.700> in

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
designed for exactly delivery people in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.450 
designed for exactly delivery people in
the<00:02:56.910> city<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.510> presumably<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:59.160> wouldn't

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
the city but I'm presumably it wouldn't

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.690 
the city but I'm presumably it wouldn't
be<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.670> bigger<00:02:59.880> jump<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.240> make<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> taxi<00:03:00.840> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
be that bigger jump to make a taxi that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.430 
be that bigger jump to make a taxi that
run<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> same<00:03:03.060> system<00:03:03.480> well<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.080> agreed<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
run on the same system well we agreed to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.120 
run on the same system well we agreed to
that<00:03:04.620> form<00:03:04.860> employees<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.430> wouldn't<00:03:07.130> or

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
that form employees that we wouldn't or

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.950 
that form employees that we wouldn't or
at<00:03:08.250> least<00:03:08.280> not<00:03:08.520> for<00:03:08.700> Laura<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> few<00:03:09.780> years

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
at least not for Laura not a few years

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.590 
at least not for Laura not a few years
that's<00:03:10.350> very<00:03:10.590> interesting<00:03:11.210> but<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.270> mean<00:03:12.420> they

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
that's very interesting but I mean they

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.880 
that's very interesting but I mean they
could<00:03:12.630> make<00:03:12.930> our<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.200> know<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.590> could<00:03:13.740> be

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
could make our we know it could be

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.560 
could make our we know it could be
produced<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.400> nap<00:03:14.520> but<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.030> 150

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
produced good nap but if you can do 150

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.500 
produced good nap but if you can do 150
miles<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.830> city<00:03:17.040> even<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.730> taxi<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.210> mean<00:03:18.390> they

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
miles in a city even a taxi I mean they

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.480 
miles in a city even a taxi I mean they
clock<00:03:18.750> up<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.960> lot<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.110> miles<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.370> know

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
clock up a lot of miles but you know

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.340 
clock up a lot of miles but you know
it's<00:03:20.670> not<00:03:20.760> impossible<00:03:21.030> well<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.960> mean<00:03:22.260> that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
it's not impossible well I mean that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's not impossible well I mean that
would<00:03:22.440> make<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> huge<00:03:23.160> difference<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.700> London

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
would make a huge difference in London

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.300 
would make a huge difference in London
if<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:24.210> were<00:03:24.270> absolutely<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.200> food<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:26.130> would

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
if they were absolutely a food it would

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.000 
if they were absolutely a food it would
be<00:03:26.430> great<00:03:26.640> yeah<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.360> think<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.840> might<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.020> some

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
be great yeah I think it might be some

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.620 
be great yeah I think it might be some
time<00:03:29.250> with<00:03:29.460> you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630
