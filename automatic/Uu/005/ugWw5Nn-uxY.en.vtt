00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.410
 since two years ago trance truck drivers have been on which the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.549
 students received 500 euro bonuses with a job guarantee 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.240
 the training has not been completely demolished due to the recession, there are many 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.449
 truck drivers without work at home 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.560
 our to find a job in transport, this is now the possibility for us 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 to become a bus driver 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.789
 a lot of truck drivers at that time 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.630
 when they 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.570
 But trucks were picked up and we got them he pointed it out 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.869
 exhibition grounds where they get them there 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 as a result, doing nothing will be his trade where they may be 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.580
 now quite a category many truck drivers that are also very good 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.290
 on the stock exchange 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.600
 alfons find was more than 20 years old truck driver 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 but since a few months there is no work 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 he is registered today to become a bus driver 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 the company went crisis and the AIVD and the boring course 9 stores 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.880
 I had my leg driver's license 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.090
 until this year it was not possible to 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.560
 what to do with it or you have to get drivers 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.580
 that is a happy confidence that the stock market is also ahead of the emergency exit 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.240
 us easier 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.780
 the curve 3g driver's license that have 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.150
 Just as before, truck drivers happened free of charge 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.630
 retrain as a bus driver with a job guarantee 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.910
 in this case you must be prepared to work in the middle of the country 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.070
 because that is where the demand for drivers in public transport is greatest 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.130
 the netherlands is lagging a bit behind because the tender for the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 transport company is not entirely clear yet we do have good ones 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.700
 contacts with all parties and therefore 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.520
 as soon as their ears are unknown north we hope to play a part there too 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 markets 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.450
 vos soest does not see itself driving the same route every day 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 I would rather not do the job in public transport 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 tourists 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.400
 for me trek when i found out more 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.480
 it is the construction of two years ago, so public transport takes a circle around the church 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.880
 to stand 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.920
 nevertheless a less attractive option but if you have a coach 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 alfred followed sees the future bright for truck drivers 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.959
 the demand for drivers has risen slightly 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.450
 in a few years even points shortage is expected
