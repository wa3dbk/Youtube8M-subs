00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 for a little video on nact in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.379
 zombies a little video that was me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 asked you were rather ask again so 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.220
 to explain where to locate all the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.720
 mannequins to achieve lighthouse rule 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.360
 that I presented to you now is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.530
 to say put the secret music on 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.089
 our breads are of course without lÃ© 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 teddy bear because I had more teddy 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.370
 everyone knows how we do 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.270
 now she presents two videos that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.000
 have been posted on youtube 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 but this time decapitating each 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 dummy have a little in kind jump that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 you see something well gore then for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 this story is that it just takes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 beheaded no need to dismember wanna 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.489
 do anything else you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.360
 just take the tests off pretty much 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.250
 I counted about 27 models then 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.899
 something else this video I'm counting 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.820
 send it alongside qg for several 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.190
 reasons first is that this little 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.350
 secret I have not seen on a 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
 community channel and the second is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 that the few times that I saw them 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.829
 on Youtube 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 because yes it's not me he has 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.509
 discovered there the explanation was given 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.460
 but we did not see the location of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.900
 each manikin for several reasons 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.490
 already the first because he had 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.790
 to look for the video would have been enough 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.009
 long 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.829
 people on doubts springs were only doing 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.500
 no mounting and second reason more 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.170
 important is because the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.640
 dummies have a random appearance 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.649
 indeed the sites that I you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 showed the man is not necessarily 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.350
 the ones you will have if you want 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 try this little secret but 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 normally it should be for the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 most enough in here I'm just attracting 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 your attention on this little passage of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.430
 the video indeed the manikin that hides 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.130
 and that's the only model 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.020
 gold map you will have to decapitate so 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.459
 it's hard enough to find and there are some 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.810
 a second one that is quite complicated 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.049
 also bath the thief just 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.240
 now he is behind the rock 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.220
 here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.500
 so you see enough to find yourself 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.780
 you just have to remove the heads and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.860
 That's it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.140
 something else once you get 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.060
 activate secret music with the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.580
 hands because you will no longer be able to act iv 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.530
 with the teddy good that's just a 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 detail is something else if I can you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.480
 give advice so you do not forget 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.830
 no mannequin is to put you 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.270
 on one side of the map not like me 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.310
 but you are one side of the map and 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.240
 dollar to weave from left to right so 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.340
 to not forget anyone 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.170
 here is the moment when the music 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 start is not going to happen soon 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.320
 I leave you and appreciate it 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.580
 personally I prefer them to that 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.110
 of we receive after that it's a 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.870
 question you me me it makes me think of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 that of dell up arcade in black ops 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.830
 number one I hope this little tutorial 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.360
 will you have served how how late he 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.460
