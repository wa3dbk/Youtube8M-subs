 not published in this concept he leaves 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.220
 comments of the river the kind things 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.719

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.719
 It will solve your shift. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.240
 Hello, I 'm a peach and this is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 school, it's all gone, people do not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.890
 asking how to do your audience 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.170
 interact more with the channel is to leave more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.020
 comments videos and stuff like this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.150
 as we all know on youtube no longer 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 it is an easy task to bring people to 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.570
 watch your video 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 now imagine making them still 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.540
 leave an opinion review or even a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 This question seems even more difficult. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.670
 but as you already know I am caÃ­que 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 Pereira and I have a tip is in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 galaxies for you that want to change was the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.060
 as in most of the videos here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.700
 school for youtube 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.770
 I tell you to think in the place of your 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.520
 body put in his place 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.869
 we watch daily several vouchers 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.619
 videos on youtube 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.960
 but only 10% or even less than that to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 People end up commenting and taking 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 people to interact comment on your 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 video you just say that I know 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 this seems obvious but many in the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 youtube ers and forget to talk to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.760
 your audience comment 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 But you have to know how to ask for your 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.360
 public 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.159
 Look at this gallery and if the oil video is 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.830
 leave your comments down here to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 next spoke such is a ready text 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.110
 that you speak in all the videos ie 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 if I eat your audience that 's it I can 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.369
 comment or not will not make a difference 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.790
 none because there is nothing closed 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.680
 now it has joined the galera that comes 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.650
 Today you and what is your opinion 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 over the pink seahorse 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.369
 You also think that you agree that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 he should be served the beauty you 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.420
 Can you tell what the difference is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 between these two examples in this second 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 Do you have a reason for this person? 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.060
 comment the goal will not write 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 Anything only you said yesterday 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.070
 you that her opinion is something only 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.100
 she can give it to you 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.640
 so here goes the secret do not ask 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.930
 comment just by asking has a reason 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.519
 for your audience comments 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.519
 of course if you asked the people 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.620
 they did not comment 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.700
 takes the trouble there and answer 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 those people 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 I shoot you and before you come 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.019
 talk but I fell that you do not even do it 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 that's because I left you my comment 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.010
 No, you do not answer, you do not say anything. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.120
 you do it yourself 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.069
 People I'm one and you are very me 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.480
