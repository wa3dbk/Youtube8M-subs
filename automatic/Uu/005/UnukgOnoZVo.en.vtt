00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
know if there's gonna be any kind of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
know if there's gonna be any kind of
movement<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> his<00:01:37.170> skin<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> blue<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
movement on his skin if the blue is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
movement on his skin if the blue is
gonna<00:01:38.340> kind<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.729> reflect<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.750> flicker

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
gonna kind of reflect it's gonna flicker

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.469 
gonna kind of reflect it's gonna flicker
it<00:01:40.350> might<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> wave<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.670> sure<00:01:41.939> but

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
it might kind of wave I'm not sure but

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.670 
it might kind of wave I'm not sure but
that's<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.780> grown<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> moment<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> very

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that's what grown the moment it's a very

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's what grown the moment it's a very
basic<00:01:44.159> model<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> looks<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:46.740> cool<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
basic model but it looks pretty cool so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920 
basic model but it looks pretty cool so
imagine<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> high<00:01:48.090> res<00:01:48.329> dub<00:01:48.600> doing

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
imagine this kind of high res dub doing

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
imagine this kind of high res dub doing
loads<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.229> stuff<00:01:49.409> shooting<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> guess<00:01:50.670> some

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
loads of stuff shooting out I guess some

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
loads of stuff shooting out I guess some
kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.119> blue<00:01:51.360> ball<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.380> home<00:01:52.590> sent

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
do you think about this first look the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.470 
do you think about this first look the
first<00:02:12.270> design<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
first design of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880 
first design of
new<00:02:13.629> peashooter<00:02:14.170> personally<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.590> think<00:02:14.800> it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
new peashooter personally I think it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.110 
new peashooter personally I think it
looks<00:02:15.040> actually<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> lot<00:02:15.760> better<00:02:16.000> than

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
looks actually a lot better than

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.460 
looks actually a lot better than
obviously<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.599> drawing<00:02:17.050> which<00:02:17.170> will<00:02:17.319> show

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
obviously the drawing which will show

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.500 
obviously the drawing which will show
you<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:17.769> now<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.549> compare<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.090> two<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.269> each

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you now now you compare the two to each

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.330 
you now now you compare the two to each
other<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:19.900> look<00:02:20.080> rather<00:02:20.440> similar<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
other they look rather similar but I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.339 
other they look rather similar but I
mean<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.000> looks<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.330> lot<00:02:22.450> better<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:23.049> here

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
mean that looks a lot better on here

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.990 
mean that looks a lot better on here
when<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> actually<00:02:23.890> see<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.340> its<00:02:24.400> full<00:02:24.519> 3d

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
when you actually see it in its full 3d

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
when you actually see it in its full 3d
model<00:02:25.659> I<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.110> don't<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:26.650> they're<00:02:26.769> gonna
