00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.310 
so here we go with another area of mine

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.880 
so here we go with another area of mine
I<00:00:03.610> just<00:00:04.330> bought<00:00:05.170> this<00:00:05.350> new<00:00:05.820> it's<00:00:06.820> a<00:00:07.180> it's<00:00:07.510> the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
Benjamin trail XL 1500 a big a scope on

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.740 
Benjamin trail XL 1500 a big a scope on
it<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:17.320> thing<00:00:17.619> shoots<00:00:17.890> at<00:00:18.570> 1500<00:00:19.570> feet

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
it and this thing shoots at 1500 feet

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
it and this thing shoots at 1500 feet
per<00:00:19.960> second<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:22.270> thing<00:00:22.480> really<00:00:22.869> alls<00:00:23.140> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
per second so the thing really alls I

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.370 
per second so the thing really alls I
could<00:00:24.550> choose<00:00:24.789> between<00:00:24.820> five<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.109> half<00:00:26.140> a

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
could choose between five and a half a

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.640 
could choose between five and a half a
four<00:00:26.619> and<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:26.830> half<00:00:26.859> I<00:00:27.220> chose<00:00:28.029> her<00:00:28.240> for<00:00:28.449> half<00:00:28.779> you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
four and a half I chose her for half you

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.519 
four and a half I chose her for half you
you<00:00:30.310> even<00:00:30.760> got<00:00:30.910> higher<00:00:31.510> velocity<00:00:32.109> with<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.289> four

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
you even got higher velocity with a four

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.779 
you even got higher velocity with a four
and<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:32.679> half<00:00:32.710> thousand<00:00:33.069> with<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.219> five<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.519> a

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
and a half thousand with a five and a

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.930 
and a half thousand with a five and a
half<00:00:34.530> those<00:00:35.530> are<00:00:35.739> just<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:36.069> bullet<00:00:36.249> form<00:00:36.550> for<00:00:36.850> my

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
half those are just a bullet form for my

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.239 
half those are just a bullet form for my
friend<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:38.260> got<00:00:39.039> this<00:00:39.219> very<00:00:39.460> heavy<00:00:39.760> ones<00:00:41.249> they

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
friend I got this very heavy ones they

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.099 
friend I got this very heavy ones they
told<00:00:42.519> me<00:00:42.699> they<00:00:42.850> are<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.969> lot<00:00:43.300> heavier<00:00:43.479> than<00:00:43.870> the

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
told me they are a lot heavier than the

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.129 
told me they are a lot heavier than the
then<00:00:44.739> gamma<00:00:45.069> ones<00:00:45.370> but<00:00:46.299> as<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.539> can<00:00:46.659> see<00:00:46.719> the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
then gamma ones but as you can see the

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:52.410 
then gamma ones but as you can see the
game<00:00:47.319> was<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:48.239> 10.49<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:50.069> these<00:00:51.069> things<00:00:51.420> where

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
game was a 10.49 and these things where

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.439 
game was a 10.49 and these things where
does<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.780> stand<00:00:53.019> there<00:00:53.679> ten<00:00:54.519> point<00:00:54.879> three<00:00:54.999> four

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
does it stand there ten point three four

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.309 
does it stand there ten point three four
so<00:00:56.409> uh<00:00:56.729> there<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:59.109> be<00:00:59.289> honest<00:00:59.679> even<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:02.289> so

so uh there to be honest even not so
happy<00:01:02.859> as<00:01:03.069> there's<00:01:03.369> the<00:01:03.609> gamma<00:01:03.789> one<00:01:04.740> but<00:01:06.660> this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
happy as there's the gamma one but this

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.940 
happy as there's the gamma one but this
thing<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.350> it's<00:01:08.710> just<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.310> beautiful<00:01:09.790> gun<00:01:10.950> you

here in in the middle and in the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.480 
here in in the middle and in the
endoscope<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:22.870> kind<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.110> stuff<00:01:23.320> but<00:01:24.010> I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.610 
endoscope and that kind of stuff but I
don't<00:01:24.820> mind<00:01:25.210> because<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.900> never<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:26.590> my

scratch that the nice wood and you can
lay<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.510> on<00:01:40.690> top<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.020> something<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.180> here<00:01:43.450> on

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
lay it on top of something and here on

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.220 
lay it on top of something and here on
the<00:01:43.659> back<00:01:43.870> you've<00:01:44.050> got<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.700> nice<00:01:45.700> rubber

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
the back you've got this nice rubber

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.910 
the back you've got this nice rubber
with<00:01:47.230> a<00:01:47.260> with<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.680> white<00:01:47.920> driving<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.740> not

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
with a with a white driving it's not

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.899 
with a with a white driving it's not
that<00:01:51.540> comfortable<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:53.110> be<00:01:53.290> honest<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.920> think<00:01:54.820> I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
that comfortable to be honest I think I

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.770 
that comfortable to be honest I think I
rather<00:01:55.150> had<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.780> wood<00:01:56.350> without<00:01:56.830> those

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
rather had just wood without those

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.140 
rather had just wood without those
ripples<00:01:58.780> on<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:01.210> had<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.960> trigger<00:02:03.150> now

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
ripples on it but I had the trigger now

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.899 
ripples on it but I had the trigger now
I<00:02:04.180> know<00:02:04.360> why<00:02:04.690> they<00:02:04.900> all<00:02:05.020> call<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:06.190> don't<00:02:06.640> want

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
I know why they all call it I don't want

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.179 
I know why they all call it I don't want
one<00:02:07.840> another<00:02:08.079> trigger<00:02:08.439> in<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.799> thing

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.189 
one another trigger in this thing

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.860 
one another trigger in this thing
because<00:02:09.909> it's<00:02:10.719> huge

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
because it's huge

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.070 
because it's huge
see<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.769> can<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.819> fairly<00:02:14.120> far<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.989> then

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
see you can get a fairly far and then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.650 
see you can get a fairly far and then
just<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> last<00:02:15.879> piece<00:02:18.010> Jarrett<00:02:19.010> will<00:02:19.190> shoot

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
just the last piece Jarrett will shoot

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.369 
just the last piece Jarrett will shoot
but<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.810> very<00:02:21.019> difficult<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.989> get<00:02:24.200> all

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
but it's very difficult to to get all

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.380 
but it's very difficult to to get all
the<00:02:24.500> pressure<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.069> then<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.760> last<00:02:25.940> moment

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the pressure and then the last moment

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.630 
the pressure and then the last moment
talk<00:02:26.599> because<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.530> thing<00:02:27.769> has<00:02:27.890> got<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.160> recall

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
talk because this thing has got a recall

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.699 
talk because this thing has got a recall
it's<00:02:28.940> unbelievable<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.440> real

pretty<00:03:16.790> big<00:03:17.139> piece<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.200> wood<00:03:18.790> also<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
pretty big piece of wood also I

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.629 
pretty big piece of wood also I
shouldn't<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.359> be<00:03:23.889> it's<00:03:24.889> a<00:03:24.980> little<00:03:25.250> bit<00:03:25.370> hard

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
shouldn't this be it's a little bit hard

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.620 
shouldn't this be it's a little bit hard
to<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:27.440> let<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.769> show<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.760> shoot<00:03:29.420> through

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
think it is this is my am kept pretty

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.420

big<00:03:36.170> hands<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:37.329> shoot<00:03:38.329> right<00:03:38.359> through<00:03:38.599> there

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
big hands you shoot right through there

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.099 
big hands you shoot right through there
also<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:41.150> did<00:03:41.599> try<00:03:42.849> some<00:03:43.849> some<00:03:44.299> different<00:03:44.660> types

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
also I did try some some different types

also I did try some some different types
of<00:03:45.290> wood<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.940> all<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.180> same<00:03:47.389> results

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
of wood and all the same results

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.949 
of wood and all the same results
carefully<00:03:48.530> extremely<00:03:49.459> hard<00:03:49.700> wood<00:03:49.910> but<00:03:50.900> uh

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
carefully extremely hard wood but uh

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.430 
carefully extremely hard wood but uh
I've<00:03:51.530> got<00:03:51.709> machete<00:03:52.069> here<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:53.359> I<00:03:53.930> shoot<00:03:54.169> one

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
I've got machete here and I shoot one

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.210 
I've got machete here and I shoot one
right<00:03:54.769> there<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:58.269> came<00:03:59.269> through<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:01.190> I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
right there and came through so I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.190 
right there and came through so I
decided<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.849> give<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.329> a<00:04:02.389> little<00:04:02.569> more<00:04:02.810> test

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
decided to give it a little more test

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.770 
decided to give it a little more test
and<00:04:04.239> then<00:04:05.239> go<00:04:05.569> for<00:04:05.810> some<00:04:05.959> metal<00:04:09.160> shoot<00:04:10.160> there

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and then go for some metal shoot there

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.099 
and then go for some metal shoot there
to<00:04:11.780> clean<00:04:12.049> through<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.150> that's<00:04:14.450> that's

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
to clean through it and that's that's

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.580 
to clean through it and that's that's
about<00:04:15.410> one<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:15.859> half<00:04:15.889> millimeters<00:04:16.549> thick

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
about one and a half millimeters thick

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.130 
about one and a half millimeters thick
come<00:04:18.590> on<00:04:18.739> exist

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
come on exist

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.750 
come on exist
so<00:04:21.140> if

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
so if

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.230 
so if
so<00:04:23.760> then<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:23.970> throw<00:04:24.360> tried<00:04:25.110> an<00:04:25.290> altar<00:04:25.950> ball<00:04:26.850> can

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
so then I throw tried an altar ball can

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.140 
so then I throw tried an altar ball can
that's<00:04:28.170> too<00:04:28.380> big<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.280> smaller<00:04:29.550> one<00:04:29.730> she<00:04:29.970> can

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
that's too big and a smaller one she can

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.720 
that's too big and a smaller one she can
shoot<00:04:30.390> through<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.620> they're<00:04:32.370> just<00:04:32.520> two

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
shoot through and they're just two
