what we did we took like four inch
nipples<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.700> cut<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.149> half<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.780> then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
nipples and I cut them in half and then

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.959 
nipples and I cut them in half and then
i<00:00:34.590> welded<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> nipples<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> cut<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> next<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
i welded the nipples the cut in next to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
i welded the nipples the cut in next to
the<00:00:39.059> barrel<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.750> put<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> pipe<00:00:40.260> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the barrel so I could put that pipe on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
the barrel so I could put that pipe on
or<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> cap<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> their<00:00:41.309> watch<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.579> look

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
or the cap on their watch out look

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
or the cap on their watch out look
you're<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> shade<00:00:42.270> shadow<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> two

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you're in the shade shadow there so two

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
you're in the shade shadow there so two
of<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.090> caps<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> third<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.320> has

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
of them have caps and the third one has

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
of them have caps and the third one has
a<00:00:47.190> 90<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> 90<00:00:49.770> comes<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> CPVC<00:00:51.780> ball

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a 90 and the 90 comes up to a CPVC ball

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.459 
a 90 and the 90 comes up to a CPVC ball
valve<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.489> enough<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.289> didn't

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
valve it's high enough that I didn't

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
valve it's high enough that I didn't
think<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.579> temperature<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.120> affect<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
think the temperature would affect it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.040 
think the temperature would affect it
and<00:00:58.550> then<00:00:59.550> after<00:00:59.910> i<00:00:59.940> welded<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> took

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and then after i welded them then I took

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
and then after i welded them then I took
a<00:01:01.260> drilled<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.890> drilled<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> center

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
a drilled and drilled through the center

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.750 
a drilled and drilled through the center
that<00:01:03.480> way<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> thought<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> had<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that way the thought I had was that I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
that way the thought I had was that I
might<00:01:05.970> burn<00:01:06.180> through<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> thing<00:01:08.040> we'd

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
might burn through it the thing we'd

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
might burn through it the thing we'd
finished<00:01:08.490> today<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.180> charcoal<00:01:09.869> basket

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
finished today was this charcoal basket

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.380 
finished today was this charcoal basket
so<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.840> had<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> great<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.740> old<00:01:13.890> barbecue

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
so I had a great from an old barbecue

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
so I had a great from an old barbecue
you<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> been<00:01:15.840> used<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.490> bent

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you see it's been used and I just bent

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
you see it's been used and I just bent
this<00:01:18.450> expanded<00:01:19.290> metal<00:01:19.530> fit<00:01:19.740> around<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this expanded metal fit around it and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.660 
this expanded metal fit around it and
welded<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.909> place<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.650> then<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> little

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
welded in place and then we had a little

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
welded in place and then we had a little
bit<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.509> believe<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.900> half<00:01:25.200> inch<00:01:25.439> angle

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bit of this I believe is half inch angle

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.370 
bit of this I believe is half inch angle
iron<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> dress<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.290> we

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
iron so just to dress it up and so we

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
iron so just to dress it up and so we
went<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> cut<00:01:28.829> her<00:01:28.920> fingers<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> top<00:01:29.790> we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
went to cut her fingers on the top we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.130 
went to cut her fingers on the top we
put<00:01:30.810> angle<00:01:31.140> iron<00:01:31.259> around<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> sides<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
put angle iron around the sides and then

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
put angle iron around the sides and then
Luke<00:01:34.320> had<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> great<00:01:34.829> idea<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> handle

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Luke had a great idea about this handle

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
Luke had a great idea about this handle
I<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.180> trying<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> figure<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I was trying to figure out how to put a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
I was trying to figure out how to put a
handle<00:01:37.470> across<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> people<00:01:38.850> just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
handle across here a lot of people just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.929 
handle across here a lot of people just
weld<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> lot<00:01:39.990> across<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
weld to have a lot across there the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
weld to have a lot across there the
problem<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.500> if

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
problem you have is if you do that is if

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.499 
problem you have is if you do that is if
you<00:01:43.860> try<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> jump<00:01:44.399> more<00:01:44.549> dump<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.090> charcoal

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you try to jump more dump more charcoal

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.990 
you try to jump more dump more charcoal
in<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> handle<00:01:46.320> gets<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> way

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
in there then the handle gets in the way

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.440 
in there then the handle gets in the way
so<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.030> made<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> handle<00:01:50.030> again<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.240> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so we made this handle again this is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.480 
so we made this handle again this is
some<00:01:51.720> stainless<00:01:52.619> steel<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.100> came<00:01:53.310> off<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
some stainless steel that came off that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.569 
some stainless steel that came off that
old<00:01:53.670> barbecue<00:01:54.060> great<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.979> bent<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
old barbecue great we just bent it you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.149 
old barbecue great we just bent it you
can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.790> where<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.090> welded<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> nut<00:01:57.750> i<00:01:58.070> welded<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
can see where we welded a nut i welded a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.719 
can see where we welded a nut i welded a
washer<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.850> side<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.729> ease

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
washer to the side so they would ease

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.620 
washer to the side so they would ease
the<00:02:02.790> swiveling<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> handle<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:05.479> lot<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the swiveling of the handle a lot of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.510 
the swiveling of the handle a lot of
people<00:02:06.780> make<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.320> grates<00:02:07.710> I've<00:02:07.950> seen<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
people make these grates I've seen and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
people make these grates I've seen and
then<00:02:09.209> they<00:02:09.330> weld<00:02:09.569> bolts<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> bottom<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
then they weld bolts to the bottom of it

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.059 
then they weld bolts to the bottom of it
to<00:02:11.250> give<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:11.760> elevation<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> ball

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
to give it some elevation from the ball

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.319 
to give it some elevation from the ball
and<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:15.170> grade<00:02:15.439> I<00:02:15.469> had<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.980> too<00:02:16.159> big<00:02:16.400> so

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
and the grade I had was too big so

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.199 
and the grade I had was too big so
rather<00:02:17.510> than<00:02:17.659> cut<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.170> great<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.590> size<00:02:18.829> as<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
rather than cut the great to size as you

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.020 
rather than cut the great to size as you
can<00:02:20.359> see<00:02:20.569> we<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:21.280> two<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> half<00:02:22.549> inches<00:02:22.700> or

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
can see we have two and a half inches or

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.610 
can see we have two and a half inches or
so<00:02:23.209> between<00:02:23.659> the<00:02:23.870> bottom<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.290> great<00:02:24.499> and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so between the bottom of the great and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.770 
so between the bottom of the great and
the<00:02:24.680> bottom<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.159> expanded<00:02:25.549> metal<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.629> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the bottom of the expanded metal so the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.509 
the bottom of the expanded metal so the
great<00:02:27.049> itself<00:02:27.650> acts<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.159> our<00:02:29.200> our<00:02:30.200> feet<00:02:30.680> so

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
great itself acts like our our feet so

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.039 
great itself acts like our our feet so
Luke<00:02:31.730> take<00:02:31.969> that<00:02:32.150> top<00:02:32.329> off<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.750> let's<00:02:32.900> put

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
Luke take that top off and let's put

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.929 
Luke take that top off and let's put
this<00:02:33.200> great<00:02:33.500> down<00:02:33.799> inside<00:02:34.129> there<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.819> when<00:02:37.909> I

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
this great down inside there so when I

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.949 
this great down inside there so when I
got<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.269> barrel<00:02:40.480> obviously<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.540> burned<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
got the barrel obviously I burned the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.319 
got the barrel obviously I burned the
inside<00:02:42.319> because<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.590> used<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.889> have<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
inside because it used to have a

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.849 
inside because it used to have a
helicopter<00:02:44.329> grease<00:02:44.840> inside<00:02:45.079> us<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.590> burned

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
helicopter grease inside us so we burned

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.619 
helicopter grease inside us so we burned
the<00:02:46.010> inside<00:02:46.280> real<00:02:46.459> good<00:02:46.669> makes<00:02:46.909> your<00:02:47.030> hair<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
the inside real good makes your hair you

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.940 
the inside real good makes your hair you
know<00:02:47.719> we<00:02:47.840> cleaned<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:48.169> out<00:02:48.290> first<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.739> then<00:02:48.859> I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
know we cleaned it out first and then I

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.709 
know we cleaned it out first and then I
burned<00:02:49.219> it<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.549> i<00:02:50.269> welded<00:02:52.719> three-quarter

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
burned it and i welded three-quarter

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.059 
burned it and i welded three-quarter
inch<00:02:53.840> i<00:02:53.989> believe<00:02:54.169> it's<00:02:54.319> three<00:02:54.469> corners<00:02:54.859> maybe

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
inch i believe it's three corners maybe

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.429 
inch i believe it's three corners maybe
it's<00:02:55.219> one<00:02:55.400> inch<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:55.930> think<00:02:56.930> it's<00:02:57.019> one<00:02:57.230> inch

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
it's one inch I think it's one inch

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.420 
it's one inch I think it's one inch
angle<00:02:58.069> iron<00:02:59.319> kind<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.469> rectangular<00:03:01.189> shape

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
angle iron kind of a rectangular shape

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.209 
angle iron kind of a rectangular shape
down<00:03:01.669> there<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:03.260> wanted<00:03:03.439> a<00:03:03.739> nice<00:03:03.919> strong

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
down there and I wanted a nice strong

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:11.409 
down there and I wanted a nice strong
great<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.730> hold<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:06.079> bottom<00:03:06.469> on<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.180> took<00:03:11.359> a

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
great to hold the bottom on so we took a

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.149 
great to hold the bottom on so we took a
cookie<00:03:11.719> sheet<00:03:12.019> as<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.379> can<00:03:12.469> see<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.769> cast<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
cookie sheet as you can see the cast the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.729 
cookie sheet as you can see the cast the
asses<00:03:13.579> all<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.689> looks<00:03:14.810> got<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.139> light<00:03:15.349> there<00:03:15.560> so

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
asses all it looks got a light there so

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.289 
asses all it looks got a light there so
you<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:15.919> see<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.280> angle<00:03:16.549> iron<00:03:16.699> down<00:03:16.939> inside

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
you can see the angle iron down inside

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.349 
you can see the angle iron down inside
there<00:03:17.509> so<00:03:18.139> then<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.409> I<00:03:19.180> kind<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.209> did<00:03:20.329> a

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
there so then I I kind of did a

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.119 
there so then I I kind of did a
backwards<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.049> should<00:03:21.229> have<00:03:21.349> built<00:03:21.500> my<00:03:21.650> firebox

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
backwards I should have built my firebox

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.460 
backwards I should have built my firebox
first<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:22.970> put<00:03:23.449> that<00:03:23.479> England<00:03:24.079> but<00:03:24.259> I

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
first and then put that England but I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.559 
first and then put that England but I
ended<00:03:25.340> up<00:03:25.400> having<00:03:25.699> to<00:03:25.729> build<00:03:25.909> that<00:03:26.090> fire<00:03:26.269> box

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
ended up having to build that fire box

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.030 
ended up having to build that fire box
to<00:03:26.780> fit<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.139> angler<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.739> worked<00:03:27.889> out

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
to fit the angler and it worked out

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.849 
to fit the angler and it worked out
perfectly<00:03:28.519> because<00:03:28.609> i<00:03:28.849> had<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:30.349> old
