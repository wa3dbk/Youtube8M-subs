00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.430
 What happened friends here we are in my 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.150
 desk and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.710
 translate enchantments in line 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.710
 craft in 1.6 points 2 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
 data 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.680
 in kraft versions because and we're going to 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.840
 create a new folder 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.920
 here we are going to fly any name 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.920
 What can be 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.410
 now let's copy this and we're going to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.230
 come here we are going to copy these two things 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.280
 that are the many deputies and we are going to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.280
 paste in translation 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.830
 now what are we going to do is this 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830
 of name translation 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 translation 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.390
 and it is already 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.480
 translating good this now that it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.300
 talk to a notebook if it was touched 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.430
 this and here we are going to put the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.930
 name translation all the same has this 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.670
 and the work keeps good to proceed 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.980
 to put to open with the file 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.690
 assets minecraft textures 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:39.280
 let's go to font and these two like that to ss and 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.770
 and that was still there under that is what 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.800
 let's copy to a folder that can 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.070
 be any folder just here and we're going to 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.180
 paste then what are we going to do 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 to this we are going to save already this we are going to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.140
 copy it we were going to put it like this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.700
 the national b like that and a low 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.700
 it will be the same 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 then let's grab these two 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.660
 cons and we're going to do it here 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.940
 and we 're going to replace it, this is something 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.090
 close this if we want we eliminate it already 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 and now we proceed to arrive blanchard the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.330
 Minecraft 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 let's go to profile here we're going to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.740
 put fÃ©lix translation I'm profile and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 now we see the minecraft that I have 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.390
 prepared everything 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.500

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.840
 and good friends friends here we continue and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.880
 now show the least how is this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.100
 how it works translated and good wife 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.430
 let's put this and I would undo those 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.120
 rare letters are going to come out now lyrics in 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.130
 English and what we have to do more or 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.500
 least guess what you can get to 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.480
 take out let's see first with easier 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.250
 our being with a sword 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.989
 we will go to dispose and close until 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.799
 it's over what can be more or less 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.799
 aena 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.150
 I do not know why this assumption 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.420
 if the good animal this out there goes with 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.750
 fire tips for example good not 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.750
 he left 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.900
 now let's see will save us to see if 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.489
 something comes out that we want with 10 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.489
 cold range 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.219
 good 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.500
 and more or less firewall this is now and 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.909
 if it opens with games 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.270
 this time fire aspects 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:57.390
 as you will see something can be assumed 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.610
 very little but you can and I assure you 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.970
 they will help a lot more than throwing 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.470
 Random letters that you throw randomly and do not 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.860
 will try to be able to fast 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.600
 for example, I for its function is not 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.810
 thing that charles 4 and the sides the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.600
 stronger harness said something of something the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.410
 words or something like that and well we continue with the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.250
 bow the bow 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.250
 we'll see 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:40.139
 why the ship does not have to see now 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:42.699
 and good infiniti 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.860
 you have to read all the words but 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.799
 well this works like this is pretty 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:53.499
 special with the fai long swing 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:55.749
 protection 'I do not know about you now but what 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.519
 best of all this is that we are not going to 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:00.009
 have to do everything at random and we're going to 

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:02.199
 be able to do something at least often and good 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.139
 I hope you liked it, like it 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.069
