I'm<00:03:26.640> blanking<00:03:27.000> right<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.659> where<00:03:27.870> he

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
I'm blanking right now but it's where he

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.199 
I'm blanking right now but it's where he
basically<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.860> goes<00:03:29.010> thermal<00:03:29.670> essentially

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
basically it goes thermal essentially

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.870 
basically it goes thermal essentially
and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.580 
and
to<00:03:31.240> see<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> outlines<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.470> like

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
to see the outlines like it's like

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.020 
to see the outlines like it's like
whited<00:03:33.010> out<00:03:33.130> or<00:03:33.340> something<00:03:33.670> like<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.910> but

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
whited out or something like that but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.150 
whited out or something like that but
these<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.930> guards<00:03:35.320> or<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.560> people<00:03:36.010> he's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
these the guards or the people he's

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.800 
these the guards or the people he's
Batman's<00:03:36.700> attacking<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.240> thumbs<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.720> all

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
Batman's attacking like thumbs and all

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.870 
Batman's attacking like thumbs and all
this<00:03:37.900> stuff<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.890> seems<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.490> a<00:03:39.520> brief

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
this stuff and it seems for a brief

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.760 
this stuff and it seems for a brief
second<00:03:40.480> Harley<00:03:40.810> Quinn<00:03:41.020> has<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.500> same<00:03:41.740> effect

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
second Harley Quinn has that same effect

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.860 
second Harley Quinn has that same effect
as<00:03:42.220> well<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.610> where<00:03:42.760> she<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.180> basically<00:03:43.720> it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
as well to where she can basically it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.170 
as well to where she can basically it
goes<00:03:44.020> thermal<00:03:44.770> for<00:03:45.130> her<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.520> then<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.060> can

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
goes thermal for her and then you can

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.420 
goes thermal for her and then you can
see<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.360> outlines<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.380> cops<00:03:47.740> essentially

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
see the outlines of the cops essentially

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.460 
see the outlines of the cops essentially
and<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:48.670> she<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:49.480> sneak<00:03:49.750> up<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.020> them<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.380> all

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
and so she can sneak up on them and all

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.690 
and so she can sneak up on them and all
that<00:03:50.500> stuff<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:50.980> she<00:03:51.100> knows<00:03:51.250> where<00:03:51.430> they<00:03:51.520> are

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
that stuff and she knows where they are

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.310 
that stuff and she knows where they are
and<00:03:51.880> where<00:03:51.970> they're<00:03:52.060> walking<00:03:52.450> around<00:03:52.570> so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
and where they're walking around so

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.050 
and where they're walking around so
apparently<00:03:54.070> she<00:03:54.220> has<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.550> ability<00:03:54.940> as<00:03:55.030> well

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
apparently she has that ability as well

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.670 
apparently she has that ability as well
