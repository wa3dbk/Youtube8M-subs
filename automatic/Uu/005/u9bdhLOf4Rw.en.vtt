and<00:02:31.379> forth<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:31.890> designed<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> together

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and forth and we designed it together

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
and forth and we designed it together
and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.819> showed<00:02:33.000> him<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> was<00:02:33.420> doing<00:02:33.720> I

and<00:02:36.110> together<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.440> built<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:39.000> like

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and together we built it and it's like

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.270 
and together we built it and it's like
the<00:02:39.239> Quig<00:02:39.480> child<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.709> quick<00:02:40.920> tech<00:02:41.129> which

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the Quig child and the quick tech which

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.740 
the Quig child and the quick tech which
is<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> first<00:02:41.670> ones<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.209> those<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
is the first ones that we did those to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
is the first ones that we did those to
the<00:02:43.140> foot<00:02:43.290> child<00:02:43.500> took<00:02:43.650> two<00:02:43.830> years<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.310> get

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the foot child took two years to get

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
the foot child took two years to get
right<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.780> playing<00:02:46.379> with<00:02:46.560> trying<00:02:46.890> trying

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
right of just playing with trying trying

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.440 
right of just playing with trying trying
to<00:02:47.370> figure<00:02:47.580> out<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> work

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to figure out like how to make it work

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.780 
to figure out like how to make it work
how<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.050> make<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.349> work<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.950> same

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
how to make it work you know and same

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.770 
how to make it work you know and same
thing<00:02:50.819> happened<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:51.239> these<00:02:51.420> where<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.720> took
