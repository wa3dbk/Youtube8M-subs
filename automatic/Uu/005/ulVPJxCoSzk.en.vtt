could fit in a tea slot and a 24-inch
machine<00:00:37.739> screw<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> slot

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
machine screw and I have one in the slot

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.790 
machine screw and I have one in the slot
here

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
here

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.510 
here
it<00:00:41.309> does<00:00:41.640> bind<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.329> tiny<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.129> pairs

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it does bind a tiny bit and if in pairs

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
it does bind a tiny bit and if in pairs
it<00:00:44.789> binds<00:00:45.030> even<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> found

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it binds even more so what I found

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.940 
it binds even more so what I found
myself<00:00:46.680> doing<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.660> put<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.379> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
myself doing was I put two of these in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.200 
myself doing was I put two of these in
the<00:00:50.940> slot<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.440> screwed<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.760> plywood

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the slot and then I screwed the plywood

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.500 
the slot and then I screwed the plywood
straight<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.829> tea<00:00:56.010> tea<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.030> tea<00:00:57.059> piece

straight to the tea tea the tea piece

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.709 
straight to the tea tea the tea piece
inside<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> t-slot<00:00:58.949> instead<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> sliding<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
inside the t-slot instead of sliding it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
inside the t-slot instead of sliding it
all<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.199> place<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.250> binded<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
all in one place because it binded so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.560 
all in one place because it binded so
much<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> uh<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.129> find<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.729> make<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.390> or

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
much but uh I find a way make it work or

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330 
much but uh I find a way make it work or
a<00:01:06.600> wack<00:01:06.900> cetera<00:01:07.320> I'll<00:01:07.860> find<00:01:08.070> something

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.699 

yeah<00:02:10.719> this<00:02:10.929> could<00:02:11.140> squeeze<00:02:11.439> a<00:02:11.469> little

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
yeah this could squeeze a little

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.500 
yeah this could squeeze a little
together<00:02:12.069> if<00:02:12.219> I<00:02:12.340> clamp<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.819> glue<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.299> clamp

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
together if I clamp it glue it and clamp

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
together if I clamp it glue it and clamp
it<00:02:13.689> it'll<00:02:14.079> look<00:02:14.109> just<00:02:14.230> fine<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.969> can<00:02:16.090> see

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it it'll look just fine as you can see

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.490 
it it'll look just fine as you can see
right<00:02:18.010> here<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.879> it's<00:02:19.540> protrudes<00:02:20.109> a<00:02:20.260> little

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
right here that it's protrudes a little

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.410 
right here that it's protrudes a little
bit<00:02:20.650> that's<00:02:21.340> fine<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.909> better<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.239> stand

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
bit that's fine it's better to stand

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.899 
bit that's fine it's better to stand
back<00:02:22.659> and<00:02:22.930> come<00:02:23.049> up<00:02:23.079> short<00:02:23.469> and<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:24.010> put

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
back and come up short and have to put

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.610 
back and come up short and have to put
it<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> jig<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.719> recut<00:02:26.200> them<00:02:26.379> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
it in the jig and recut them and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.020 
it in the jig and recut them and
possibly<00:02:27.400> make<00:02:27.849> this<00:02:28.060> gap<00:02:28.239> even<00:02:28.540> wider<00:02:28.780> which

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
possibly make this gap even wider which

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.270 
possibly make this gap even wider which
defeats<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> purpose<00:02:31.329> of<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.689> box<00:02:31.900> joint<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
defeats the purpose of a box joint so I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.729 
defeats the purpose of a box joint so I
could<00:02:33.489> sand<00:02:33.790> glue<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.359> together<00:02:34.540> sand<00:02:35.019> these

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
could sand glue this together sand these

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.289 
could sand glue this together sand these
flush<00:02:36.219> and<00:02:36.489> I'll<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.420> ready<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.719> go<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:40.150> you
