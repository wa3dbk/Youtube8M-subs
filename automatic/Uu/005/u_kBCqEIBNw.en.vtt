adapters<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.650> pretty<00:00:16.830> much<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> plug<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
adapters and pretty much you plug this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.880 
adapters and pretty much you plug this
into<00:00:17.609> USB<00:00:18.000> 2.0<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> other<00:00:19.500> end<00:00:19.650> out

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
into USB 2.0 and on the other end out

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
into USB 2.0 and on the other end out
comes<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> VGA<00:00:20.640> where<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.000> add<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> second

two monitors now before I go into this
one<00:00:45.329> precisely<00:00:45.690> let<00:00:45.870> me<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:46.079> let<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.410> bring<00:00:46.620> up

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
one precisely let me get let me bring up

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.610 
one precisely let me get let me bring up
the<00:00:46.890> speed<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> Triton<00:00:48.239> line<00:00:48.930> first<00:00:49.469> of

the speed on the Triton line first of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.590 
the speed on the Triton line first of
all<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> UV<00:00:50.610> 100<00:00:51.180> which<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.329> their

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
all they have the UV 100 which is their

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
all they have the UV 100 which is their
c2<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.350> their<00:00:52.500> regular<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.640> one

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
c2 that's their regular one that one

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.569 
c2 that's their regular one that one
does<00:00:53.850> 1600<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.390> 1200<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> UV

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
does 1600 by 1200 then they have the UV

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.420 
does 1600 by 1200 then they have the UV
200<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.600> their<00:00:57.930> c2<00:00:58.469> extreme<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.309> one

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
200 which is their c2 extreme that one

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
200 which is their c2 extreme that one
does<00:00:59.550> 1920<00:01:00.000> by<00:01:00.090> 1200<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> very<00:01:01.410> high

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
does 1920 by 1200 that's a very high

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
does 1920 by 1200 that's a very high
resolution<00:01:01.680> external<00:01:02.250> adapter<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
resolution external adapter and this is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
resolution external adapter and this is
the<00:01:04.110> Express<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.400> device<00:01:05.519> right

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the Express this little device right

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.679 
the Express this little device right
here<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> 13<00:01:06.900> 60<00:01:07.320> by<00:01:07.500> 768<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
here will do 13 60 by 768 and it's

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
here will do 13 60 by 768 and it's
pretty<00:01:09.869> much<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> smallest<00:01:10.500> resolution<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
pretty much the smallest resolution the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
pretty much the smallest resolution the
lowest<00:01:11.490> resolution<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.689> if

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
lowest resolution of all of them but if

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
lowest resolution of all of them but if
you're<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> small

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you're you know if you have a small

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
you're you know if you have a small
monitor<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.689> need<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.380> big

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
monitor you don't really need the big

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
monitor you don't really need the big
resolution<00:01:17.280> why<00:01:17.460> pay<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> bigger

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
resolution why pay more for the bigger

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.609 
resolution why pay more for the bigger
adapter<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.470> for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
adapter and when you get this one for

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.609 
adapter and when you get this one for
less<00:01:19.920> money<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> again<00:01:21.840> 13<00:01:22.320> 60

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
less money this will do that again 13 60

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.969 
less money this will do that again 13 60
by<00:01:22.770> 768<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> popular

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
by 768 and will do all the popular

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
by 768 and will do all the popular
numbers<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> 12<00:01:27.420> 1024<00:01:28.020> by<00:01:28.110> 768

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
numbers like what is it 12 1024 by 768

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.149 
numbers like what is it 12 1024 by 768
or<00:01:28.770> 1280<00:01:29.400> by<00:01:29.549> 768<00:01:29.930> you're<00:01:30.930> 17<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.829> you're

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
or 1280 by 768 you're 17 you're you're

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
or 1280 by 768 you're 17 you're you're
20<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.549> 19<00:01:32.909> inch<00:01:33.030> monitors<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.630> smaller

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
20 or 19 inch monitors that are smaller

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
20 or 19 inch monitors that are smaller
resolution<00:01:34.290> it'll<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> those<00:01:35.579> no

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
resolution it'll do all of those no

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600 
resolution it'll do all of those no
problem<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.560> unique<00:01:37.710> device<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> very

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
problem so very unique device and very

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.870 
problem so very unique device and very
useful<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.180> well<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.700> much

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
useful as well and that's pretty much
