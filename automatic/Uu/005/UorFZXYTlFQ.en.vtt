00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.269
 hit the site welcome to my channel 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.189
 of year but kate today i will have 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.789
 with a new video to do my 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.750
 favorites of the month of March so the year 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.269
 pass very quickly 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.460
 so here I discovered products 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.430
 and I'm crazy about taking off you 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.289
 show all this I do not have a lot of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.879
 products 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:40.059
 so here we go we will not start the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.809
 hair category for the category of 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.850
 hair is my detangler without 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.690
 pickup from l'orÃ©al 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.359
 so I do not know what kind of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 things to market me hayek the term hair 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.840
 then the second product is without 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.429
 hesitate my dry shampoo from 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.070
 Baptist did not know the songs 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.199
 French than before murray had 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.100
 bought 1 I wanted to show and that's 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.290
 rare for me I pray then I do not 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.869
 do not know if others can do it 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.430
 with on etc. short my hair is bland 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.960
 or in the lead when the keys are not 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.470
 from where they are not only Dutch who are 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.759
 in fact normal but his padou and 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.689
 I like when they are really or 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.780
 great touch etc 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.610
 and that makes me feel much sweeter 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.950
 so it does not make me volume I 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.210
 put in months after you pack and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.610
 not during the volume but I do 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.840
 I do not put it simply I brush 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.439
 my hair and they are really 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.540
 always 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.149
 so that's the hair category 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.570
 manon in front for the house category 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.899
 with house item point I have a 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.880
 candle I'm crazy it's the one of 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.720
 at sephora so that if you go see 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.320
 and it's a candle 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:03.390
 at the moonlight I did I'm going to tread 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 jesus burned her once and so but 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.470
 she still walks what's good and I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 therefore undertake to redeem 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 chocolate it costs 3 or 4 euros at 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.890
 sephora and they are really great 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.840
 you have a lot of morgen et cetera that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.220
 this is body milk scrub 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.380
 candle that for the barca you all 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.459
 the perfumes myfreid chocolate is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.750
 fat and so I loved it it's my 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.910
 pet 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 So here we go and now we do not 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.950
 of a bow laughed this is the category 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.730
 makeup so then the one where the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.370
 basic liquids it's a killing this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.360
 palette of killings just go 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.709
 magnificent 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 what comes and it's not be it's 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.610
 that we believe it is light are going 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 do the pipes or fissile and it's 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.150
 people who say to the perfumes of 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.410
 questions of phew and turn but I 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.180
 can do stuff phew 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.820
 so we can do both very very 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.630
 lightweight with for example the foxy color 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.850
 the color niquette 2 so then a 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.720
 small palette 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.989
 so I have not removed the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.680
 plastic but I have not you is you 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 never presented 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.400
 this one is naked flush so because 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.780
 that she is brand new 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.519
 but I was forgetting the madam is 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.280
 favorite because jesus has tested four 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.970
 at least once and it's a favorite 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.060
 crazy 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.640
 so here it is and in fact we have a browser a 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.799
 friend an illuminator is a bluff 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.450
 then I also loved where the co 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.120
 number of 130 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.599
 so it's an eye shadow and we 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.760
 will say a little creamy 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:52.629
 but to show you completely she is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.739
 really great it cost me 3 90 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.019
 something like that i do not know 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.269
 really more price or 5 I know more 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.389
 the price is so voila but she is 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.010
 really beautiful the color as we 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.480
 can see the pigmentation is really 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.329
 crazy and she is really beautiful 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.909
 and that for the outer corner etc themselves 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.780
 just that on the eyelid 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:20.620
 know how to handle a little black gray with 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.780
 small glitters in fact so 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.539
 that's it then you know very well that my 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.210
 mascara pfe that's jelly not with 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.160
 me it is in my kit but it is the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.090
 mascara volum express from maybelline 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.070
 so it's red 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.400
 he goes up the swimming pool in addition to 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.820
 my favorites and I also have a pencil 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.680
 crazy 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.889
 so you know now 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.180
 it's the master djama from maybelline 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.830
 objects already bigger than he is 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.169
 also in my kit it is too much 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.599
 quickly this one but I wanted to finish 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.389
 before starting the other so that's it and 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.199
 it's crazy I've got this one too 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.710
 cost 11 years I think then the last 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.720
 product 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.159
 it's also what I saw in the squat 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.099
 with the aena is the body milk at the 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:09.789
 vanilla from yves rock so I had to 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.539
 use it twice and then from one to 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.220
 do you man 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.470
 if you put a big one big 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.690
 you really apply and it penetrates 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.409
 super easily with metal tip and 3 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.289
 hours etc 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.449
 it is born super good and so I 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.820
 I'll go buy it more 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.680
 great since for simple summer since 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.789
 it'll be finished soon in three 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.060
 days it will be over 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.880
 So here and then this month a big blow 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.940
 of heart level food 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.390

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.170
 finally I eat that dessert I mens that 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.570

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.580
 it's before I was not addicted to that 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.590

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.990

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.520
 a sick thing in fact I cut the 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.770
 grapefruit and I put a lot of 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.150
 sugar over talent and I 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.650
 eating it is either a gray or otherwise

 little raspberry grenadine really 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.190
 very very scared because otherwise it's 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.870
 loud and that's great too 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.270
