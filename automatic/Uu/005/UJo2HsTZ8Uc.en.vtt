 there in collaboration with teacher and again 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.259
 ensured that it was varied 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.640
 program was presented for what the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.040
 students during the clowning 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 have learned the lessons 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 the clowns are trained in the area 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.860
 among other things focus the rhythm 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.860
 improvisation making a real one 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 know what these then just these two 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.859
 customer will first have practiced this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 it goes like this Thumbs couple alone 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.090
 you put a blow down and the other one that looks 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 shortly after and they had tableau 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 know an important topic is where the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 human ends and where the clown begins and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 how far to draw this line is so 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.190
 the clown developed himself in the loop 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 from the first year 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.180
 this development continues in the second year 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.010
 even further and deeper 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.190
 past 4 months there is hard and with 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.910
 a lot of enthusiasm worked by the 14 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.300

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.260
 environment without an audience this evening 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 they were allowed to use it for the first time 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.100
 show the audience what they are all about 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.510
 have made their own 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.180
 after all, the clown exists by grace 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.350

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.350
