00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:04.081
 Lots of shit stress us 

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.090
 The whole world just rushes and fetches Fetches and rushes 

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.697
 Only drugs and violence 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:09.790
 I hate drugs! 

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:13.011
 The worst is what my friend told me Do you know what he is dealing with? 

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:17.170
 His home is on crack, that's just terrible 

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:19.847
 That's pressure 

00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:24.100
 Your home is cracked 

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:25.893
 that you MUST have a rent! 

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.887
 He runs out and "Give me the rent!" 

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:33.829
 "He's only tenth!" "Do I Need It!" 

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:37.487
 "Give me at least twenty now" 

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:39.579
 "and the rest later" 

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:43.310
 And in a few hours "hey I need more" 

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.246
 "The house is falling apart and some things have emerged" 

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.788
 You'll come home early from the party 

00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:55.527
 Home in the apartment "Aaa what are you doing in my house?" 

00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:58.295
 Where the sink is, I came to fix it 

00:00:59.337 --> 00:01:00.695
 She's in the kitchen 

00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.766
 I thought he was in a drawer 

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.980
 I'll do it tomorrow when I come to rent 

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.994
 I hate when people in my age and older 

00:01:14.154 --> 00:01:16.494
 they are on crack It sucks 

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.850
 It's too much to experiment with drugs 

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.042
 At some age it should be behind you 

00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:24.225
 and if you didn't do it to a certain age, you miss it 

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:27.672
 Drugs are the same for very old people 

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:30.514
 Being 75 you know I'm right 

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:35.972
 Being 75 I take crack, heroin, everything, shit 

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:41.133
 I would go down the street and people just "Look at that stoned grandfather" 

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.231
 I'm not for everything Maybe grass 

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:07.950
 A little grass is not as bad as everything else 

00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:11.056
 Grass is a natural substance 

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:15.388
 You can smoke some flowers and still work 

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:18.717
 Not the fastest one 

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.503
 but you work 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.109
 Nothing more than grass 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 I did the mistake once 

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.320
 a guy gave me some shit on party ... 

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.664
 ... fucking sponge " 

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:37.242
 I took them and forgot about it 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.236
 A few days later I found it in my pocket so why not? 

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:44.957
 I thought it was like a natural grass shit 

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.796
 I planned my day as if it were grass 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.186
 So I ate it 

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.706
 to go to the barber and then to the cinema 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.144
 Get it 

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.644
 so far so good 

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:08.144
 Then I was at the barber 

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:10.386
 then an hour later 

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:13.798
 and I was just thinking 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.492
 it sucks 

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:18.145
 it tastes like a sole 

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:23.784
 I was sick but I wasn't totally busy 

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.729
 Then I look into the mirror 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.664
 and I saw the barber's reflection 

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:34.837
 looked ... 

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:38.325
 He looked like a giant penis shearing my hair 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.512
 he panicked here 

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.700
 I told myself Dave quiet 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.085
 on drugs 

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:49.897
 it makes drugs 

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:51.954
 and you know ... 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.315
 that there is no way 

00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:59.174
 how would a penis 

00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.829
 he could cut his hair 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.272
 But I scared I couldn't stand it anymore 

00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:10.262
 I jumped out of my chair for my hair didn't care 

00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:13.736
 just put a handful of money on the barber 

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.411
 it was a weird ball opened 

00:04:19.275 --> 00:04:23.171
 and I ran the house as fast as I could 

00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:25.567
 I went mad 

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:29.166
 on hours it was 2:42 I say to myself "Damn ... 

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:32.066
 ... 2:42 I have to sober ... 

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:36.445
 I've never been so old before 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.503
 I got a shower - still busy 

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:44.724
 maybe music will help me 

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:48.425
 So I put on every CD I had 

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:52.964
 I'm still going I'll be practicing, it helps 

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:57.013
 Run here block 4 times still 

00:04:57.322 --> 00:05:00.990
 I stretched out I woke up - shit 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.958
 I looked for hours and it was 2:43!
