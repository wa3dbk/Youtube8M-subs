00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
this video with my iphone 3gs i'm going

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
this video with my iphone 3gs i'm going
to<00:00:24.930> I've<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.619> been<00:00:25.890> using<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.090> incipio

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to I've actually been using the incipio

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.029 
to I've actually been using the incipio
gel<00:00:27.840> shell<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> that's<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:28.830> really

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
gel shell and that's what I'm really

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
gel shell and that's what I'm really
reviewing<00:00:29.400> today<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.789> i<00:00:29.970> love<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.689> case

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
reviewing today but i love this case

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
reviewing today but i love this case
I've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> wife<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:33.000> very<00:00:33.149> similar

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I've got a for a wife it's very similar

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.470 
I've got a for a wife it's very similar
to<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.620> ifrogz<00:00:34.620> case<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.969> guys<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to my ifrogz case as you guys know I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.470 
to my ifrogz case as you guys know I
always<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.680> very<00:00:38.219> slim<00:00:38.910> case<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
always like a very very slim case that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.119 
always like a very very slim case that
will<00:00:39.570> give<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> impact<00:00:40.350> resistance<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
will give you the impact resistance in

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
will give you the impact resistance in
the<00:00:41.160> scratch<00:00:41.520> resistance<00:00:42.260> with<00:00:43.260> minimal<00:00:43.800> bulk

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the scratch resistance with minimal bulk

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
the scratch resistance with minimal bulk
added<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.600> taking<00:00:46.110> away<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
added and you know taking away from the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.860 
added and you know taking away from the
iphone<00:00:46.980> look<00:00:47.399> itself<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> i've<00:00:49.980> been<00:00:50.039> using

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
iphone look itself so i've been using

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
iphone look itself so i've been using
since<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.050> ifrogz<00:00:52.469> i've<00:00:52.710> been<00:00:52.829> using<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> gels

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
since my ifrogz i've been using the gels

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.880 
since my ifrogz i've been using the gels
the<00:00:53.789> gel<00:00:54.180> case<00:00:54.420> by<00:00:54.690> Incipio<00:00:55.399> it's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
the gel case by Incipio it's a very just

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
the gel case by Incipio it's a very just
soft<00:00:58.890> case<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:01:00.270> looking<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.230> next

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
soft case and I'm looking for my my next

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
soft case and I'm looking for my my next
case<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> replace<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> ifrogz<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.969> was

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
case to replace the ifrogz I was

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
case to replace the ifrogz I was
thinking<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> getting<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.619> for

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
thinking of getting one of these for

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
thinking of getting one of these for
myself<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.330> came<00:01:06.420> across<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
myself but then i came across the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
myself but then i came across the
incipio<00:01:07.610> sil<00:01:08.610> acrylic<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.540> i'm<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
incipio sil acrylic which i'm going to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
incipio sil acrylic which i'm going to
show<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.710> guys<00:01:10.890> today<00:01:12.860> cilic<00:01:13.860> Ehrlich<00:01:14.189> comes

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
show you guys today cilic Ehrlich comes

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.600 
show you guys today cilic Ehrlich comes
in<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:15.810> pieces<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> silicon<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
in two pieces the silicon and the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.899 
in two pieces the silicon and the
acrylic<00:01:21.799> one<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.220> noticed<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
acrylic one thing I have noticed and if

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
acrylic one thing I have noticed and if
you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:26.430> picks<00:01:27.240> up

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you can see here is that this picks up

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.920 
you can see here is that this picks up
dust<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> lint<00:01:28.549> don't<00:01:29.549> love<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.790> aspect<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
dust and lint don't love that aspect of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.560 
dust and lint don't love that aspect of
it<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.610> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> notice<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.090> other<00:01:33.360> one

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it but if you notice there other one

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.950 
it but if you notice there other one
picks<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.350> nothing<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.820> seems<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.840> there

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
picks up nothing so seems to be there

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
picks up nothing so seems to be there
using<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> different<00:01:37.619> material<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
using a different material here and this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
using a different material here and this
is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:39.090> harder<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.890> bendable<00:01:41.670> but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
is a little harder not as bendable but

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.219 
is a little harder not as bendable but
still<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:45.770> silicon<00:01:46.770> shell<00:01:48.229> now

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
still a you know a silicon shell now

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.160 
still a you know a silicon shell now
between<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:52.320> goes<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.950> this

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
between the two this goes on like this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
between the two this goes on like this
really<00:01:55.170> pretty<00:01:55.380> easy<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.100> silica<00:01:56.490> guns<00:01:56.729> goes

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
really pretty easy the silica guns goes

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
really pretty easy the silica guns goes
on<00:01:57.270> very<00:01:57.509> easy<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
on very easy you can see this is a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.740 
on very easy you can see this is a
tighter<00:02:00.270> fit<00:02:00.890> holds<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:01.979> better<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:03.540> thing

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
tighter fit holds on better this thing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
tighter fit holds on better this thing
is<00:02:03.869> always<00:02:04.020> loose<00:02:04.350> around<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> edges<00:02:04.950> this

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is always loose around the edges this

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.479 
is always loose around the edges this
one<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.380> then<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
one is not so I like that and then the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639 
one is not so I like that and then the
shell<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.509> acrylic<00:02:09.869> she'll<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.319> goes<00:02:10.500> on

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
shell the acrylic she'll just goes on

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.000 
shell the acrylic she'll just goes on
the<00:02:10.800> back

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the back

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.809 

really<00:02:14.010> easy

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.220 

just<00:02:20.480> going<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.689> make<00:02:20.749> sure<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.019> get<00:02:21.109> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
just going to make sure you get the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.319 
just going to make sure you get the
corners<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:24.909> like<00:02:25.909> the<00:02:26.060> feel<00:02:26.299> of

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
corners and it's in I like the feel of

other thing I know is I like to put my
phone<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.000> my<00:03:38.180> lap<00:03:38.359> in<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.569> car<00:03:38.889> this<00:03:39.889> will

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
phone on my lap in the car this will

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.999 
phone on my lap in the car this will
just<00:03:40.189> slide<00:03:40.939> anywhere<00:03:41.419> because<00:03:41.569> it's<00:03:42.009> hard

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:43.009 
just slide anywhere because it's hard

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.039

shell<00:03:43.280> where's<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.269> thing<00:03:44.509> stays<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.959> your

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
shell where's this thing stays in your

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.059 
shell where's this thing stays in your
lap<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:46.250> overall<00:03:46.729> I<00:03:47.120> think<00:03:47.689> this<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.169> not

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
lap but overall I think this is a not

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.309 
lap but overall I think this is a not
very<00:03:49.099> bulky<00:03:49.549> case<00:03:49.909> pretty<00:03:50.479> minimal<00:03:50.930> not<00:03:51.139> as

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
very bulky case pretty minimal not as

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.349 
very bulky case pretty minimal not as
minimal<00:03:51.739> as<00:03:51.889> say<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.599> innocase<00:03:55.060> but<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.180> is

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
minimal as say the innocase but it is

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.149 
minimal as say the innocase but it is
softer<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.259> I'm<00:03:57.349> kind<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.620> hoping<00:03:57.919> that<00:03:58.040> will

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
softer so I'm kind of hoping that will

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.830 
softer so I'm kind of hoping that will
keep<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.639> the<00:03:58.849> dust<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.359> little<00:03:59.599> bit<00:03:59.689> better

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
keep out the dust a little bit better

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.170 
keep out the dust a little bit better
and<00:04:00.879> hold<00:04:01.879> up<00:04:02.090> for<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> long<00:04:03.019> time<00:04:04.030> alright<00:04:05.030> guys
