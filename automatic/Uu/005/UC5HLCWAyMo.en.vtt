here<00:00:10.570> we<00:00:10.750> have<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:12.839> guitars<00:00:13.839> made<00:00:14.559> with<00:00:14.889> San

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
here we have two guitars made with San

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.519 
here we have two guitars made with San
Francisco<00:00:16.059> style<00:00:16.480> sourdough<00:00:18.210> dough<00:00:19.210> and<00:00:19.660> I'm

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
Francisco style sourdough dough and I'm

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.540 
Francisco style sourdough dough and I'm
going<00:00:20.829> to<00:00:21.160> be<00:00:21.490> squaring<00:00:21.880> them<00:00:26.369> they'll<00:00:27.369> be

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
going to be squaring them they'll be

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:36.410 
going to be squaring them they'll be
scored<00:00:27.939> with<00:00:28.450> longitudinal<00:00:31.169> cuts<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:34.950> unlike

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
scored with longitudinal cuts and unlike

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.660 
scored with longitudinal cuts and unlike
the<00:00:37.420> google<00:00:37.809> i<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:40.270> be<00:00:40.510> wanting<00:00:41.440> them<00:00:42.219> to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
the google i will be wanting them to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.380 
the google i will be wanting them to
develop<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:44.800> bloom<00:00:45.129> with<00:00:45.960> ears<00:00:46.960> that<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
develop good bloom with ears that is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.029 
develop good bloom with ears that is
achieved<00:00:50.319> in<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:50.920> very<00:00:51.100> different<00:00:51.550> manner<00:00:51.579> from

how bull is scored in the first place I

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.989 
how bull is scored in the first place I
want<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.670> curved<00:00:58.120> blade<00:00:58.510> so<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.649> will<00:01:00.069> end<00:01:00.339> the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
want a curved blade so I will end the

want a curved blade so I will end the
llama<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:03.190> give<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.399> nice<00:01:03.720> curve<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:07.260> rather

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
llama to give a nice curve and rather

surface the low if I'll be scoring at
about<00:01:13.870> 30<00:01:14.320> degrees<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.930> wrist<00:01:17.230> is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
about 30 degrees so your wrist is

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.780 
about 30 degrees so your wrist is
rotated<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.310> will<00:01:18.790> be<00:01:18.940> scoring<00:01:19.300> like<00:01:19.630> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
rotated and will be scoring like this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.230 
rotated and will be scoring like this
the<00:01:23.910> score<00:01:24.910> should<00:01:25.660> be<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:26.760> quarter<00:01:27.760> inch<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.210> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the score should be a quarter inch to a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.210 
the score should be a quarter inch to a
half<00:01:28.480> inch<00:01:28.690> deep<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:33.990> softer<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.170> dough<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
half inch deep the softer the dough the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.310 
half inch deep the softer the dough the
more<00:01:36.430> slack<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:37.060> dough<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.690> higher<00:01:37.870> the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
more slack the dough the higher the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.660 
more slack the dough the higher the
hydration<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.270> shallower<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.810> cut<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
hydration the shallower the cut if the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.930 
hydration the shallower the cut if the
cut<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.120> too<00:01:43.660> deep<00:01:45.750> rather<00:01:46.750> than<00:01:47.430> rising<00:01:48.430> up

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
cut is too deep rather than rising up

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.870 
cut is too deep rather than rising up
with<00:01:50.010> oven<00:01:51.010> spring<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.470> will<00:01:54.160> tend<00:01:54.520> to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
with oven spring it will tend to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.980 
with oven spring it will tend to
collapse<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:56.050> its<00:01:56.620> own<00:01:56.830> weight<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.750> may

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
collapse of its own weight so this may

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.680 
collapse of its own weight so this may
be<00:01:59.050> counterintuitive<00:01:59.560> but<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.060> get<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.300> better

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
be counterintuitive but you get a better

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.810 
be counterintuitive but you get a better
ear<00:02:02.050> with<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> more<00:02:02.920> shallow<00:02:03.330> cut<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
ear with a more shallow cut the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.620 
ear with a more shallow cut the
cuts<00:02:07.060> are<00:02:07.360> made<00:02:07.480> just<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.640> leading<00:02:10.179> edge

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
cuts are made just with the leading edge

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.890 
cuts are made just with the leading edge
or<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> far<00:02:11.380> edge<00:02:11.560> rather<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:13.030> blade<00:02:13.300> not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
or the far edge rather of the blade not

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.060 
or the far edge rather of the blade not
the<00:02:14.200> whole<00:02:14.410> blade<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.450> again<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:17.850> swift<00:02:18.850> sure

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the whole blade and again a swift sure

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.130 
the whole blade and again a swift sure
unhesitating<00:02:21.070> cut<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.270> going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.840> give<00:02:23.020> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
unhesitating cut is going to give you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.410 
unhesitating cut is going to give you
the<00:02:23.290> best<00:02:23.500> result

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the best result

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170 
the best result
so<00:02:25.420> let's<00:02:26.110> transfer<00:02:26.920> these<00:02:27.100> those<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
so let's transfer these those to the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:44.920 
so let's transfer these those to the
peel

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.670 

and<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:46.709> I'll<00:02:47.099> do<00:02:47.459> one<00:02:48.420> cut<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and I think I'll do one cut on one of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.210 
and I think I'll do one cut on one of
the<00:02:49.860> loads<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.400> two<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.150> other<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.620> here's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the loads and two on the other so here's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.390 
the loads and two on the other so here's
the<00:02:53.550> first<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:57.060> second<00:02:57.590> these<00:02:58.590> cuts<00:02:58.950> should

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the first the second these cuts should

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.500 
the first the second these cuts should
be<00:02:59.580> overlapping<00:03:00.120> by<00:03:00.569> about<00:03:02.300> 25<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.780> 30<00:03:04.050> percent

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
be overlapping by about 25 to 30 percent

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.630 
be overlapping by about 25 to 30 percent
so<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.709> cross<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.340> mostly

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
so a little bit of cross but mostly

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.289 
so a little bit of cross but mostly
longitudinal<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:13.819> now<00:03:14.819> we're

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
longitudinal like that and now we're

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.780 
longitudinal like that and now we're
ready<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.660> steam<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.319> oven<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.769> load<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
ready to steam the oven and load the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.560 
ready to steam the oven and load the
loaves<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> stone
