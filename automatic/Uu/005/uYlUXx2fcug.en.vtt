I<00:01:12.890> believe<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> hotkey<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.730> trigger<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.360> menu

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
I believe the hotkey to trigger the menu

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.120 
I believe the hotkey to trigger the menu
to<00:01:14.900> actually<00:01:15.200> pull<00:01:15.350> up<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.590> grappling<00:01:15.830> hook

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
to actually pull up this grappling hook

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.920 
to actually pull up this grappling hook
feature<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.700> control<00:01:17.240> end<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> lot<00:01:17.900> of

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
feature is control end but a lot of

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.090 
feature is control end but a lot of
people<00:01:18.080> I<00:01:18.260> saw<00:01:18.440> we're<00:01:18.590> doing<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:18.890> with<00:01:19.070> a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
people I saw we're doing this with a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.980 
people I saw we're doing this with a
pistol<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.760> personally<00:01:20.360> prefer<00:01:20.660> this<00:01:20.780> sniper

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
pistol I personally prefer this sniper

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.540 
pistol I personally prefer this sniper
because<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.590> range<00:01:21.800> for<00:01:22.040> your<00:01:22.130> webs<00:01:22.340> is

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
because the range for your webs is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.610 
because the range for your webs is
literally<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.360> distance<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.870> your<00:01:23.960> sniper<00:01:24.260> so

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
literally the distance of your sniper so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.710 
literally the distance of your sniper so
think<00:01:24.860> about<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:25.250> no<00:01:25.550> matter<00:01:25.790> how<00:01:26.090> far<00:01:26.450> you

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
think about that no matter how far you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.510 
think about that no matter how far you
want<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> shoot<00:01:27.140> your<00:01:27.260> sniper<00:01:27.560> as<00:01:27.830> long<00:01:28.250> as<00:01:28.400> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
want to shoot your sniper as long as it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.370 
want to shoot your sniper as long as it
can<00:01:28.700> hit<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.150> building<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:30.050> actually

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
can hit that building you can actually

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.080 
can hit that building you can actually
swing<00:01:30.860> over<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.490> building<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.940> you'll

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
swing over to that building and you'll

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.640 
swing over to that building and you'll
see<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:32.390> footage<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:32.810> was<00:01:32.960> grappling<00:01:33.260> onto
