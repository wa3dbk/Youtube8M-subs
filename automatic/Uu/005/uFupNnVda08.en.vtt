pushed me to the very last strand of my
patience<00:03:38.050> my<00:03:38.430> mind<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> my<00:03:39.760> heart<00:03:39.940> began<00:03:40.180> to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
patience my mind and my heart began to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.600 
patience my mind and my heart began to
challenge<00:03:40.990> each<00:03:41.230> other<00:03:41.500> by<00:03:41.800> asking<00:03:42.340> me<00:03:42.460> to

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
challenge each other by asking me to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.250 
challenge each other by asking me to
decide<00:03:42.940> whether<00:03:43.270> I<00:03:43.390> should<00:03:43.510> continue<00:03:44.230> to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
decide whether I should continue to

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.420 
decide whether I should continue to
fight<00:03:44.590> for<00:03:44.620> her<00:03:45.010> or<00:03:45.250> let<00:03:45.910> her<00:03:46.060> go

unfortunately<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.460> decided<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.090> we<00:03:49.300> needed

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
unfortunately I decided that we needed

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.710 
unfortunately I decided that we needed
some<00:03:49.810> space<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.470> think<00:03:50.500> things<00:03:51.010> over<00:03:51.250> I

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
some space to think things over I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.390 
some space to think things over I
thought<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.960> was<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.380> best<00:03:53.620> solution<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:54.130> save

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
thought it was the best solution to save

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.360 
thought it was the best solution to save
our<00:03:54.580> relationship<00:03:55.350> she<00:03:56.350> never<00:03:56.530> gave<00:03:56.800> up<00:03:56.980> on<00:03:57.130> me

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
our relationship she never gave up on me

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.800
