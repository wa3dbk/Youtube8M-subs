00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
is sort of out there feeling however

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.380 
is sort of out there feeling however
first<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.160> all<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> time<00:03:19.519> line<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.940> really

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
first of all the time line is really

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.340 
first of all the time line is really
hard<00:03:20.720> thing<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.930> find

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
hard thing to find

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.099 
hard thing to find
I<00:03:21.489> think<00:03:22.489> it's<00:03:22.609> smart<00:03:22.760> because<00:03:23.299> it's<00:03:23.900> very

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
I think it's smart because it's very

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.170 
I think it's smart because it's very
smart<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.769> think<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.489> you're<00:03:25.670> not<00:03:25.730> paying

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
smart but I think if you're not paying

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.449 
smart but I think if you're not paying
attention

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
hair low usually it's supposed to be

where the lighting is yes they're
basically<00:05:26.070> trying<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.400> copy<00:05:26.700> like<00:05:27.180> Hollywood

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
basically trying to copy like Hollywood

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.360 
basically trying to copy like Hollywood
lighting<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.530> sense<00:05:28.800> but<00:05:29.190> it's<00:05:29.490> an<00:05:29.820> anime<00:05:30.180> I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
lighting in a sense but it's an anime I

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.730 
lighting in a sense but it's an anime I
well<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.640> think<00:05:33.479> overall<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.020> animation<00:05:34.560> was

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
well I think overall the animation was

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.170 
well I think overall the animation was
really<00:05:35.070> good<00:05:35.220> it<00:05:35.280> was<00:05:35.400> very<00:05:35.430> consistent<00:05:35.940> they

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
really good it was very consistent they

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.880 
really good it was very consistent they
had<00:05:36.330> other<00:05:36.810> elements<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.350> you<00:05:37.500> could<00:05:37.680> bring

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
had other elements that you could bring

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.590 
had other elements that you could bring
in<00:05:38.039> I<00:05:38.160> thought<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.430> was<00:05:40.700> consistently<00:05:41.700> not<00:05:41.850> my

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
in I thought it was consistently not my

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.240 
in I thought it was consistently not my
style<00:05:42.870> well<00:05:43.590> yeah<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:45.320> just<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.530> loved<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.220> so

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
that's part of the reason why they were

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.340 
that's part of the reason why they were
able<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.600> bring<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:57.900> so<00:05:58.080> many<00:05:58.169> different

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
Fantasy it was genius so how they

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.740 
Fantasy it was genius so how they
brought<00:06:04.440> in<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.680> space<00:06:05.280> show<00:06:06.120> that<00:06:06.330> I<00:06:06.390> have<00:06:06.570> to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
brought in a space show that I have to

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.060 
brought in a space show that I have to
admit<00:06:06.960> that<00:06:07.140> I<00:06:07.200> like<00:06:07.289> the<00:06:07.590> fact<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:07.890> they

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
admit that I like the fact that they

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.320 
admit that I like the fact that they
jump<00:06:08.310> back<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.580> forth<00:06:08.640> and<00:06:08.970> then<00:06:09.090> you<00:06:09.120> had

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
jump back and forth and then you had

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.170 
jump back and forth and then you had
characters<00:06:09.750> from<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:09.930> future

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
characters from the future

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.090 
characters from the future
I<00:06:11.210> think<00:06:11.600> something<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:12.020> would<00:06:12.290> the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
I think something like would the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.310 
I think something like would the
continuity<00:06:13.760> issue<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.330> was<00:06:14.420> almost<00:06:14.600> like<00:06:14.870> like

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
continuity issue it was almost like like

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.050 
continuity issue it was almost like like
the<00:06:15.620> characters<00:06:16.130> were<00:06:16.370> it<00:06:16.520> was<00:06:16.640> like<00:06:16.670> Back<00:06:16.940> to

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
the characters were it was like Back to

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.910 
the characters were it was like Back to
the<00:06:17.090> Future<00:06:17.180> they<00:06:17.510> were<00:06:17.570> trying<00:06:18.020> not<00:06:18.110> to<00:06:18.290> spill
