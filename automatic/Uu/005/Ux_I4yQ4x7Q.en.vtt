00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
appointments was to figure out what the
particular<00:01:09.479> dentist's<00:01:09.930> office<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.470> area

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
particular dentist's office and our area

kids I think most dentist office are
gonna<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:18.210> much<00:01:18.390> play<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> by<00:01:18.840> ear<00:01:19.049> with

and<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> half<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.549> insurance<00:01:26.759> covers

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and a half but if your insurance covers

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
and a half but if your insurance covers
it<00:01:27.450> every<00:01:27.689> six<00:01:27.900> months<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:29.220> they're<00:01:29.369> under

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it every six months when they're under

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.980 
it every six months when they're under
18<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> might<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
18 then you might want to just do it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
18 then you might want to just do it
because<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.890> covered<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
because it just might be covered and I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520 
because it just might be covered and I
think<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.360> good<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> start<00:01:33.840> getting<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.380> in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
think it's good to start getting them in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
think it's good to start getting them in
as<00:01:34.890> early<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> they're

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as early as you can just so that they're

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
as early as you can just so that they're
used<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> dentist<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.590> they're<00:01:37.950> used<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
used to the dentist and they're used to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
used to the dentist and they're used to
that<00:01:38.400> preventative<00:01:39.030> taking<00:01:39.570> care<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> your

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that preventative taking care of your

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.950 
that preventative taking care of your
teeth<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.250> before<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.600> end<00:01:42.810> up

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
teeth and all that before you end up

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.539 
teeth and all that before you end up
thinking<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> dentist<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> bad<00:01:44.220> thing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
thinking of the dentist as a bad thing

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
thinking of the dentist as a bad thing
and<00:01:44.850> maybe<00:01:45.450> other<00:01:45.659> kids<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.170> cavities

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and maybe other kids that have cavities

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
and maybe other kids that have cavities
talk<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.310> kids<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.640> they're<00:01:47.759> older<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
talk to your kids when they're older and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.090 
talk to your kids when they're older and
their<00:01:48.990> teeth<00:01:49.140> start<00:01:49.409> falling<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.860> when

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
their teeth start falling out when

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950 
their teeth start falling out when
they're<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.369> 6<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.210> they're<00:01:51.329> scared<00:01:51.840> about

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
they're like 6 and they're scared about

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080 
they're like 6 and they're scared about
it<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.399> getting<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.939> there

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it so I just think getting them in there

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
it so I just think getting them in there
is<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.890> get

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
is really as you can just to kind of get

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
is really as you can just to kind of get
familiarized<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> works<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.630> have

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
familiarized with how it works and have

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
familiarized with how it works and have
a<00:01:58.170> good<00:01:58.610> recollection<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.060> dentist's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
a good recollection of the dentist's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.359 
a good recollection of the dentist's
from<00:02:01.200> an<00:02:01.320> early<00:02:01.530> age<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.040> thing<00:02:02.189> when<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
from an early age is a good thing when I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
from an early age is a good thing when I
ask<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> dentist<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.259> do

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
ask them at the dentist what they do

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080 
ask them at the dentist what they do
they<00:02:04.979> say<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.369> kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> play<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.060> by

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
they say that they kind of play it by

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
they say that they kind of play it by
ear<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.479> kids<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.619> our<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
ear with the kids with our one and a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.320 
ear with the kids with our one and a
half<00:02:08.190> year<00:02:08.399> old<00:02:08.429> basically<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.149> just

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
half year old basically they would just

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.190 
half year old basically they would just
be<00:02:09.599> looking<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.500> his<00:02:10.619> teeth

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
be looking at his teeth

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.020 
be looking at his teeth
in<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> chair<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.370> kind<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.670> looking<00:02:12.940> around

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
in the chair just kind of looking around

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670 
in the chair just kind of looking around
making<00:02:13.480> sure<00:02:13.660> he<00:02:13.810> didn't<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.110> any<00:02:14.290> cavities

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
making sure he didn't have any cavities

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.740 
making sure he didn't have any cavities
they<00:02:15.459> didn't<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:15.790> any<00:02:15.970> x-rays<00:02:16.330> or<00:02:16.569> anything

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
they didn't do any x-rays or anything

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.150 
they didn't do any x-rays or anything
for<00:02:16.959> either<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.200> our<00:02:17.349> kids<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.830> wouldn't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
for either of our kids we wouldn't

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.130 
for either of our kids we wouldn't
personally<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.150> anyway<00:02:19.420> but

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
personally have one of that anyway but

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.229 
personally have one of that anyway but
the<00:02:20.260> specific<00:02:20.680> office<00:02:21.010> they<00:02:21.730> were<00:02:21.790> fine<00:02:22.060> not

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the specific office they were fine not

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.610 
the specific office they were fine not
doing<00:02:22.510> them<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.989> don't<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.440> would

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
doing them and I don't think they would

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.600 
doing them and I don't think they would
have<00:02:23.739> for<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> half<00:02:24.430> year<00:02:24.580> old

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
have for my one and a half year old

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.540 
have for my one and a half year old
anyway<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.989> also<00:02:26.349> they<00:02:26.890> will<00:02:27.099> probably<00:02:27.430> give

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
anyway and also they will probably give

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.650 
anyway and also they will probably give
you<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.700> option<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.330> want<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.569> do

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
you the option if you want to do

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.270 
you the option if you want to do
fluoride<00:02:29.050> or<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.440> don't<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.950> your<00:02:30.040> older

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
fluoride or if you don't for your older

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.309 
fluoride or if you don't for your older
children<00:02:30.489> we<00:02:31.150> personally<00:02:31.690> opt<00:02:32.050> out<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
children we personally opt out of

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.720 
children we personally opt out of
fluoride<00:02:32.739> there's<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> lot<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.430> reasons<00:02:33.640> for

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
fluoride there's a lot of reasons for

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.250 
fluoride there's a lot of reasons for
that<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.209> do<00:02:34.300> your<00:02:34.420> own<00:02:34.480> research<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:35.230> I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
that you can do your own research but I

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.540 
that you can do your own research but I
think<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:35.560> good<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.040> kind<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.430> what

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
think it's good to know kind of what

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.130 
think it's good to know kind of what
you're<00:02:36.670> getting<00:02:36.790> into<00:02:37.060> before<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.630> get<00:02:37.900> there

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
you're getting into before you get there

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.130 
you're getting into before you get there
and<00:02:38.350> also<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.610> think<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:40.269> good<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:41.019> I've

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
and also I think it's good to like I've

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.570 
and also I think it's good to like I've
been<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.530> dentist<00:02:41.680> before<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.459> know

been to that dentist before so I know

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.759 
been to that dentist before so I know
what<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.209> layout<00:02:43.390> looks<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.230> know<00:02:44.560> what

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
what the layout looks like I know what

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.650 
what the layout looks like I know what
