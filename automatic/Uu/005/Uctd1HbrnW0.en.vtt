do like the aesthetic changes he's made
to<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:48.139> if<00:01:49.139> this<00:01:49.319> is<00:01:49.380> speedrun<00:01:50.130> mod<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> gets

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
to it if this is speedrun mod so it gets

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.719 
to it if this is speedrun mod so it gets
supposed<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.359> make<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.689> faster<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.549> mean
