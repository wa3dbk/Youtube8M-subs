00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
system here we've got all these lines

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.830 
system here we've got all these lines
which<00:02:17.160> you'll<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.849> minute

which you'll see here in a minute
and<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> sanki<00:02:19.920> system<00:02:20.250> isn't<00:02:20.430> easy<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.000> get

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and the sanki system isn't easy to get

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.089 
and the sanki system isn't easy to get
apart<00:02:21.450> no<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.110> little<00:02:22.230> ring<00:02:22.530> clip<00:02:22.860> and

apart no the little ring clip and
everything<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.670> kind<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.599> difficult<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.290> a

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
everything so kind of difficult for a

everything so kind of difficult for a
home<00:02:25.500> brewer<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.950> use<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
home brewer to use now this is just a

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.509 
home brewer to use now this is just a
try<00:02:27.450> clamp<00:02:27.750> which<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.200> real<00:02:28.860> easy<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.250> take<00:02:29.400> out

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
try clamp which is real easy to take out

out<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> here<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.870> makes<00:02:52.049> more<00:02:52.260> sense<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.680> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
out of here it makes more sense just to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.339 
out of here it makes more sense just to
do<00:02:53.069> them<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.450> put<00:02:54.660> casters<00:02:55.110> on

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
do them in here so and we put casters on

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.259 
do them in here so and we put casters on
these<00:02:55.560> yeah<00:02:55.769> there<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.880> wheel<00:02:57.150> them

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
these yeah there so you can wheel them

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.539 
these yeah there so you can wheel them
around<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:58.319> we<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> ramp<00:02:59.430> that

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
around and yeah we do have a ramp that

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.130 
around and yeah we do have a ramp that
comes<00:02:59.880> into<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.299> it's<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:01.079> now

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
comes into here it's not on right now

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.750 
comes into here it's not on right now
but<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:01.799> wheel<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
but we will wheel these in and out of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.479 
but we will wheel these in and out of
here<00:03:03.000> along<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.540> fermenter<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.560> these

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
here along with the fermenter I do these

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.520 
here along with the fermenter I do these
conical<00:03:05.940> 'he's<00:03:06.090> will<00:03:06.420> keep<00:03:07.410> your

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
conical 'he's will keep your

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.759 
conical 'he's will keep your
fermentation<00:03:08.099> temperature<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:10.440> where<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
fermentation temperature right where it

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.110 
fermentation temperature right where it
needs<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.099> be<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.430> they<00:03:11.549> have<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> hard<00:03:11.940> time

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
needs to be but they have a hard time

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.360 
needs to be but they have a hard time
cooling<00:03:12.599> all<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> way<00:03:13.019> down<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.470> crash<00:03:14.160> the

cooling all the way down to crash the
East<00:03:14.610> out<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> roll<00:03:15.870> them<00:03:16.019> into<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.530> cold

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
noticed we're having a pale ale made

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.420 
noticed we're having a pale ale made
with<00:03:58.440> HBC<00:03:59.329> 342<00:04:00.329> two<00:04:00.900> hops<00:04:01.230> yeah<00:04:01.650> ya<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.280> where

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
with HBC 342 two hops yeah ya know where

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.069 
with HBC 342 two hops yeah ya know where
did<00:04:02.549> these<00:04:02.639> hops<00:04:02.880> come<00:04:03.120> from<00:04:03.299> there<00:04:03.810> one<00:04:03.959> of

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
did these hops come from there one of

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.839 
did these hops come from there one of
the<00:04:04.139> hops<00:04:04.530> out<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.889> experimental<00:04:05.340> program

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
the hops out of the experimental program

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.559 
the hops out of the experimental program
okay<00:04:06.329> one<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:07.169> kind<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.859> its<00:04:08.099> verge<00:04:08.340> of

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
okay one that's kind of on its verge of

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.550 
okay one that's kind of on its verge of
commercialization<00:04:09.569> it's<00:04:10.049> not<00:04:10.200> quite

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
commercialization it's not quite

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.360 
commercialization it's not quite
commercialized<00:04:11.310> yet<00:04:12.169> but<00:04:13.169> I<00:04:13.470> mean<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.160> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
commercialized yet but I mean it is in a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.800 
commercialized yet but I mean it is in a
sense<00:04:14.549> because<00:04:14.790> we<00:04:14.940> do<00:04:15.120> sell<00:04:15.419> them<00:04:15.599> but<00:04:15.750> they

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
sense because we do sell them but they

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.160 
sense because we do sell them but they
don't<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.139> name<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.440> guess

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
don't have a name I guess

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.860 
don't have a name I guess
so<00:04:17.530> they'll<00:04:17.830> probably<00:04:18.070> grow<00:04:18.400> for<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:19.390> couple

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so they'll probably grow for a couple

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.740 
so they'll probably grow for a couple
more<00:04:20.020> years<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.710> hpc<00:04:21.370> 342<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.240> might<00:04:22.390> even<00:04:22.600> take

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
more years as hpc 342 it might even take

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.870 
more years as hpc 342 it might even take
longer<00:04:23.080> than<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.770> then<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.190> depending

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
longer than that and then just depending

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.650 
longer than that and then just depending
on<00:04:25.290> other<00:04:26.290> brewery<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.730> know<00:04:27.850> responses<00:04:28.270> and

on other brewery you know responses and
acceptance<00:04:29.230> will<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.650> kind<00:04:29.980> of<00:04:30.040> move<00:04:30.220> into<00:04:30.520> its

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
acceptance will it kind of move into its

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.330 
acceptance will it kind of move into its
final<00:04:30.940> stage<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.780> commercial<00:04:32.650> acceptance<00:04:33.190> and
