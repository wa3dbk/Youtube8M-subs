actually pay as you go so instead of

those swipe cards your iphone can

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.749 
those swipe cards your iphone can
actually<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.070> iphone<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.640> be

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually do it so your iphone could be

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.389 
actually do it so your iphone could be
your<00:02:05.939> wallet<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.420> your<00:02:06.509> phone<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.950> ipod

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
your wallet and your phone and your ipod

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.190 
your wallet and your phone and your ipod
which<00:02:08.879> would<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.179> great<00:02:09.509> i<00:02:09.539> could<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:09.989> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
which would be great i could see that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.790 
which would be great i could see that
really<00:02:10.739> working<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.340> society

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800

maybe a redesigned screen or redesigned
look<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> actual<00:02:30.520> phone<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.210> could<00:02:31.690> see

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
look to the actual phone I could see

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.440 
look to the actual phone I could see
obviously<00:02:32.650> hardware<00:02:33.370> improvement<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.090> want<00:02:34.360> to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
obviously hardware improvement I want to

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.710 
obviously hardware improvement I want to
see<00:02:34.600> an<00:02:34.870> amazing<00:02:35.910> amount<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.030> battery<00:02:37.390> life<00:02:37.540> in

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
see an amazing amount of battery life in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.230 
see an amazing amount of battery life in
the<00:02:37.810> next<00:02:38.050> one<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:38.800> all<00:02:39.730> smart<00:02:40.180> phones

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
these days have had issues with battery

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.240 
these days have had issues with battery
life<00:02:42.570> which<00:02:43.570> does<00:02:44.080> suck<00:02:44.380> because<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> fun

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
life which does suck because it is a fun

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.200 
life which does suck because it is a fun
you<00:02:45.370> want<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.550> have<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.760> with<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.970> all<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
time as that is how society works people

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.060 
time as that is how society works people
can't<00:02:49.450> work<00:02:49.630> without<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.960> phone<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.860> would

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
can't work without a phone so it would

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.890 
can't work without a phone so it would
be<00:02:51.220> great<00:02:51.520> if<00:02:51.550> they<00:02:52.000> could<00:02:52.030> bring<00:02:52.420> out<00:02:52.720> this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
be great if they could bring out this

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.470 
be great if they could bring out this
immense<00:02:53.740> battery<00:02:54.220> life<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.760> another

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
immense battery life for like another

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
immense battery life for like another
day<00:02:55.810> 24<00:02:56.320> hours<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.680> will<00:02:56.740> be<00:02:56.860> amazing<00:02:57.190> I

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
day 24 hours that will be amazing I

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.890 
day 24 hours that will be amazing I
don't<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.270> if<00:02:58.360> we're<00:02:58.450> going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.630> see<00:02:58.810> it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't know if we're going to see it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
don't know if we're going to see it
because<00:02:59.110> obviously<00:02:59.260> with<00:02:59.620> every<00:02:59.830> update<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
because obviously with every update you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.380 
because obviously with every update you
always<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:01.560> faster<00:03:02.560> processors<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.550> better

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
always see faster processors and better

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.240 
always see faster processors and better
graphics<00:03:04.750> cards<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.080> whatnot<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:06.010> would

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
graphics cards and whatnot so that would

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.800 
graphics cards and whatnot so that would
mean<00:03:06.460> that<00:03:06.520> that<00:03:06.910> would<00:03:07.060> drain<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> battery

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
mean that that would drain the battery

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.150 
mean that that would drain the battery
life<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.170> they<00:03:08.200> would<00:03:08.410> have<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> increase<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
life so they would have to increase the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.150 
life so they would have to increase the
battery<00:03:09.310> life<00:03:09.660> double<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.870> even<00:03:11.140> bring<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.010> up

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
battery life double to even bring it up

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.840 
battery life double to even bring it up
to<00:03:12.340> power<00:03:12.550> which<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.320> Apple<00:03:15.250> seem<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.730> be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
to power which you know Apple seem to be

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.010 
to power which you know Apple seem to be
able<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.120> do<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:16.630> do<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
able to do and they do have the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.449 
able to do and they do have the
technology<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.590> money<00:03:17.770> so<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> don't<00:03:18.190> see<00:03:18.310> why

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
technology and money so I don't see why

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.890 
technology and money so I don't see why
it's<00:03:18.640> not<00:03:18.670> possible<00:03:18.970> they<00:03:19.480> are<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.750> most

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
it's not possible they are the most

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.199 
it's not possible they are the most
likely<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.380> do<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.860> with<00:03:21.459> all<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.790> money<00:03:22.030> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
likely to do that with all the money and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.440 
likely to do that with all the money and
support<00:03:22.840> they<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.140> but<00:03:24.130> we<00:03:24.610> know<00:03:24.640> Apple<00:03:25.209> they

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
support they have but we know Apple they

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.170 
support they have but we know Apple they
do<00:03:25.510> release<00:03:26.050> pretty<00:03:26.890> mediocre<00:03:27.130> products<00:03:27.820> at

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
do release pretty mediocre products at

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.510 
do release pretty mediocre products at
times<00:03:28.920> considering<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.070> they're<00:03:30.190> able<00:03:30.370> to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
times considering what they're able to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.100 
times considering what they're able to
do<00:03:30.730> they<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.209> seem<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.390> release<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> product

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
do they just seem to release a product

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.900 
do they just seem to release a product
to<00:03:32.350> milk<00:03:32.530> for<00:03:32.680> market<00:03:33.070> then<00:03:33.550> release<00:03:33.880> a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
to milk for market then release a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.550

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
understandably I would probably do the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.690 
understandably I would probably do the
same<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.209> was<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.770> marketing<00:03:53.770> exec<00:03:54.100> for<00:03:54.370> Apple

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
feature in the new iphone that has been

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.940 
feature in the new iphone that has been
rumors<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.050> actual<00:04:14.260> screen<00:04:14.620> will<00:04:14.860> be

rumors that the actual screen will be

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.009 
rumors that the actual screen will be
able<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.100> support<00:04:15.370> 3d<00:04:15.900> obviously<00:04:16.900> your

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
able to support 3d obviously your

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.449 
able to support 3d obviously your
technology<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.530> going<00:04:17.650> towards<00:04:17.980> 3d<00:04:18.310> at<00:04:18.370> the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
technology is going towards 3d at the

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.120 
technology is going towards 3d at the
moment<00:04:18.730> so<00:04:18.820> that's<00:04:18.970> another<00:04:19.180> plausible

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
moment so that's another plausible

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.920 
moment so that's another plausible
example<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:21.850> have<00:04:21.880> said<00:04:22.240> potentially<00:04:22.840> an

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
example they have said potentially an

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.390 
example they have said potentially an
eight<00:04:23.169> megapixel

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
eight megapixel

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.249 
eight megapixel
camera<00:04:24.639> which<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.509> another<00:04:25.750> great<00:04:25.930> feature

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
camera which is another great feature

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.340 
camera which is another great feature
and<00:04:27.600> there<00:04:28.600> could<00:04:28.720> be<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.840> few<00:04:29.050> others<00:04:29.320> that

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
and there could be a few others that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.200 
and there could be a few others that
they<00:04:29.530> could<00:04:29.680> release<00:04:29.949> but<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.699> be<00:04:30.790> honest<00:04:31.030> I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
they could release but to be honest I

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.820 
they could release but to be honest I
that<00:04:31.540> would<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.690> be<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.930> wild<00:04:32.259> guess<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.710> my

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that would just be a wild guess in my

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.740 
that would just be a wild guess in my
opinion<00:04:33.100> so<00:04:33.729> that's<00:04:33.970> what<00:04:34.210> I've<00:04:34.330> heard<00:04:34.479> that's

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
opinion so that's what I've heard that's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.129 
opinion so that's what I've heard that's
what<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> think<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:36.330> they're<00:04:37.330> nice<00:04:37.570> plausible

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
what I think and they're nice plausible

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.100 
what I think and they're nice plausible
