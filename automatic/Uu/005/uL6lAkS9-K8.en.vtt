transit the moon are the following
things<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.240> trailing<00:01:25.570> edge<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.110> halo<00:01:26.590> is

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
things the trailing edge of the halo is

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.859 
things the trailing edge of the halo is
longer<00:01:27.460> than<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.759> leading<00:01:28.090> edge<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.479> halo

longer than the leading edge of the halo

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.200 
longer than the leading edge of the halo
when<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.860> do<00:01:30.040> image<00:01:30.399> work<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.820> zoom<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.180> on

when you do image work and zoom in on
them<00:01:31.570> they<00:01:31.780> often<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.590> red<00:01:33.009> or<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.369> yellowish

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030

them they often have red or a yellowish
red<00:01:34.930> edge<00:01:35.680> on<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.579> core<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.450> object<00:01:39.299> most

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
red edge on the core of the object most

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.240 
red edge on the core of the object most
times<00:01:40.630> they<00:01:40.930> follow<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.350> very<00:01:41.710> straight

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
times they follow a very straight

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.450 
times they follow a very straight
pattern<00:01:42.610> as<00:01:43.450> if<00:01:43.750> they're<00:01:43.960> not<00:01:44.170> quite<00:01:44.560> maybe

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
pattern as if they're not quite maybe

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.179 
pattern as if they're not quite maybe
Midway<00:01:46.060> or<00:01:46.390> just<00:01:47.079> past<00:01:47.320> Midway<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.009> moon

Midway or just past Midway to the moon

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.459 
Midway or just past Midway to the moon
that's<00:01:48.490> my<00:01:48.670> best<00:01:48.909> guess<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.689> am<00:01:49.990> working<00:01:50.200> on

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
that's my best guess and I am working on

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.980 
that's my best guess and I am working on
a<00:01:50.530> way<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.670> try<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.909> determine<00:01:52.359> distance<00:01:52.840> on

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
a way to to try to determine distance on

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.469 
a way to to try to determine distance on
these<00:01:53.140> objects<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.670> clip<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.060> running<00:01:55.359> at

these objects this clip is running at

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.690 
these objects this clip is running at
30%<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.439> what<00:01:56.680> you'll<00:01:56.829> notice<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.460> comes

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
30% and what you'll notice is it comes

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.120 
30% and what you'll notice is it comes
to<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.060> upper<00:01:58.479> limb<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.079> Moon<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.799> you'll

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
to the upper limb of the Moon and you'll

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.130 
to the upper limb of the Moon and you'll
see<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.520> white<00:02:00.820> edge<00:02:01.030> there<00:02:01.359> that<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.659> has<00:02:01.899> been

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
see a white edge there that it has been

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.800 
see a white edge there that it has been
created<00:02:02.320> because<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.460> filter<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:03.850> used<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
created because the filter I used the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.349 
created because the filter I used the
halo<00:02:05.229> will<00:02:05.469> be<00:02:05.590> see-through<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.670> goes<00:02:06.850> over

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
halo will be see-through as it goes over

halo will be see-through as it goes over
that<00:02:07.390> white<00:02:07.810> lip<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:09.190> core<00:02:09.520> will<00:02:09.820> be

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
that white lip and the core will be

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.670 
that white lip and the core will be
solid<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.570> will<00:02:10.690> not<00:02:10.870> be<00:02:11.110> able<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.380> see<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
solid you will not be able to see the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.680 
solid you will not be able to see the
white<00:02:11.830> lift<00:02:12.100> through<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.430> core<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.090> there<00:02:13.540> it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
white lift through the core and there it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
white lift through the core and there it
is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
is

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.910 
is
alright<00:02:16.510> I'm<00:02:16.690> gonna<00:02:16.840> load<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:17.080> another<00:02:17.500> view

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
alright I'm gonna load up another view

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.230 
alright I'm gonna load up another view
here<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.550> we're<00:02:18.640> gonna<00:02:18.730> look<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
here and then we're gonna look at the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.880 
here and then we're gonna look at the
stills<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.720> took<00:02:19.960> which<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.350> why<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.590> video

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
stills I took which is why the video

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.210 
stills I took which is why the video
jumps<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.870> very<00:02:23.080> good<00:02:23.290> shot<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.860> in

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
jumps this is a very good shot in in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.490 
jumps this is a very good shot in in
real<00:02:24.460> time<00:02:24.730> full<00:02:25.150> speed<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.870> edited<00:02:29.350> out

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
real time full speed and I edited out

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
real time full speed and I edited out
the<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.280> jumps<00:02:30.640> where<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.850> took<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.270> stills

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
the the jumps where I took the stills

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.370 
the the jumps where I took the stills
and<00:02:32.610> there<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.670> goes<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:34.030> off<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.690> limb<00:02:34.870> okay

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
and there it goes up off the limb okay

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.690 
and there it goes up off the limb okay
now<00:02:35.470> I'm<00:02:35.560> gonna<00:02:35.650> load<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.160> stills<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
now I'm gonna load up the stills and you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.450 
now I'm gonna load up the stills and you
can<00:02:36.820> get<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> really<00:02:37.180> good<00:02:37.420> look<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:39.280> this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
can get a really good look here now this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.520 
can get a really good look here now this
is<00:02:39.520> one<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.360> upper<00:02:40.780> limb<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.380> moon

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
is one on the upper limb of the moon

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.900 
is one on the upper limb of the moon
this<00:02:41.740> one<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.130> taken<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.460> upper

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
this one that was taken on the upper

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.080 
this one that was taken on the upper
side<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.680> see<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.160> red<00:02:45.370> core<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
side and you can see the red core and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.120 
side and you can see the red core and
the<00:02:46.660> hail<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:46.990> bit<00:02:47.200> tougher<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.800> because

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
the hail is a bit tougher to see because

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.310 
the hail is a bit tougher to see because
of<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.340> color<00:02:48.520> behind<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.690> moon<00:02:49.900> on<00:02:50.110> this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
of the color behind the moon on this

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.310 
of the color behind the moon on this
shot<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:51.490> on<00:02:51.790> many<00:02:52.060> when<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.540> zoom<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:53.110> that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
shot but on many when you zoom in that

this<00:02:56.170> image<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:57.040> notice<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.580> trailing<00:02:57.880> edge

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
this image now notice the trailing edge

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.840 
this image now notice the trailing edge
of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.840> halo<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.620> how<00:02:59.860> much<00:03:00.100> longer<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.700> is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
of the halo here how much longer it is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.850 
of the halo here how much longer it is
than<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> leading<00:03:01.450> edge<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:02.200> oval<00:03:02.590> kind

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.750 
than the leading edge and this oval kind
of<00:03:02.950> demonstrates<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:06.390> now<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:08.490> can't<00:03:09.490> get<00:03:09.640> my

of demonstrates that now I can't get my
mind<00:03:10.090> off<00:03:10.270> being<00:03:10.330> able<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.870> shoot<00:03:11.140> these<00:03:11.320> in

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
mind off being able to shoot these in

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.490 
mind off being able to shoot these in
full<00:03:11.800> spectrum<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:13.090> haloed<00:03:13.540> objects<00:03:14.170> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
full spectrum these haloed objects and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
full spectrum these haloed objects and
I'm<00:03:14.709> gonna<00:03:14.830> go<00:03:14.950> backwards<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.610> forwards<00:03:15.970> on

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
I'm gonna go backwards and forwards on

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.880 
I'm gonna go backwards and forwards on
these<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.450> then<00:03:16.540> manipulate<00:03:17.020> speed<00:03:17.320> but

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
these and then manipulate speed but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.830 
these and then manipulate speed but
these<00:03:18.040> haloed<00:03:18.430> objects<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.270> shooting<00:03:19.630> with

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
these haloed objects it's shooting with

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.290 
these haloed objects it's shooting with
infrared<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.470> UV<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.670> got<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> wonder<00:03:22.269> what

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
infrared and UV you got to wonder what

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.930 
infrared and UV you got to wonder what
we<00:03:22.600> would<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:22.989> are<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:24.040> looking<00:03:24.370> at<00:03:24.459> heat<00:03:24.730> is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
we would get are we looking at heat is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.449 
we would get are we looking at heat is
this<00:03:25.269> energy<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.500> fact<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.950> magnetic

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
this energy is it in fact a magnetic

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.720 
this energy is it in fact a magnetic
halo<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.110> exciting<00:03:29.590> thing<00:03:29.800> is<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:30.280> when<00:03:30.550> I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
halo but the exciting thing is is when I

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.910 
halo but the exciting thing is is when I
finally<00:03:31.150> do<00:03:31.390> get<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.720> shoot<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.140> full<00:03:32.380> spectrum

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
finally do get to shoot in full spectrum

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.310 
finally do get to shoot in full spectrum

be able to break out the video channels

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.680 
be able to break out the video channels
