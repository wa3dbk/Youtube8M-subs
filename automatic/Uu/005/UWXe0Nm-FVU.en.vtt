I'm<00:01:31.280> making<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:31.670> video<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.210> show<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.479> just

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
I'm making this video to show you just

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.249 
I'm making this video to show you just
how<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.409> figured<00:01:33.950> how<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.329> the

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
how I figured how to get it in and the

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.969 
how I figured how to get it in and the
trick<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.920> found<00:01:37.250> out<00:01:37.460> was<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:39.290> has<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.799> do

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
trick that I found out was it has to do

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.690 
trick that I found out was it has to do
with<00:01:40.250> how<00:01:40.759> their<00:01:41.450> nose<00:01:41.630> grew<00:01:42.110> over<00:01:42.710> because

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
with how their nose grew over because

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.639 
with how their nose grew over because
every<00:01:44.420> person's<00:01:44.869> going<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.140> grow<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.320> different

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
every person's going to grow a different

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.130 
every person's going to grow a different
angle<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.450> if<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.600> could<00:01:47.719> figure<00:01:47.869> out<00:01:47.990> which

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
angle and if you could figure out which

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.109 
angle and if you could figure out which
angle<00:01:48.350> yours<00:01:48.829> grew<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.579> eventually<00:01:49.759> you

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
angle yours grew in and eventually you

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.179 
angle yours grew in and eventually you
will<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:51.079> can<00:01:51.229> get<00:01:51.380> an<00:01:51.530> infection<00:01:51.649> like

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
will you can get an infection like

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.399 
will you can get an infection like
otherwise<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:53.119> took<00:01:53.299> me<00:01:53.479> about<00:01:53.630> two<00:01:53.930> weeks<00:01:53.960> of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
otherwise it took me about two weeks of

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.889 
otherwise it took me about two weeks of
half<00:01:54.860> an<00:01:55.100> hour<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.640> playing<00:01:56.270> with<00:01:56.479> my<00:01:56.659> nose

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
half an hour just playing with my nose

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.209 
half an hour just playing with my nose
and<00:01:57.229> trying<00:01:57.469> to<00:01:57.560> get<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.770> thing<00:01:57.920> into<00:01:58.070> my

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
and trying to get this thing into my

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.789 
and trying to get this thing into my
nose<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:58.729> didn't<00:01:59.149> work<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.560> I'm

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
nose it just didn't work and so I'm

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.130 
nose it just didn't work and so I'm
going<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.490> show<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.789> how<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.479> figured<00:02:02.990> how<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
going to show you how I figured how to

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.539 
going to show you how I figured how to
get<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.439> in<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:03.920> going<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.189> take<00:02:04.310> mine

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
get it in so I'm just going to take mine

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.300 
get it in so I'm just going to take mine
out<00:02:04.579> first

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
out first

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.090 
out first
so<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:06.640> took<00:02:06.790> out<00:02:06.940> my<00:02:07.060> nose<00:02:07.270> ring<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.110> this

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
so I just took out my nose ring and this

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.520 
so I just took out my nose ring and this
is<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.420> when<00:02:11.140> they<00:02:11.290> first

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
is the one that you get when they first

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.780 
is the one that you get when they first
put<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.950> your<00:02:12.130> nose<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.660> bigger<00:02:13.840> one

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
put in your nose kind of a bigger one

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.600 
put in your nose kind of a bigger one
chunkier<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> one<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> read

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
chunkier one this is the one that I read

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.480 
chunkier one this is the one that I read
about<00:02:18.640> me<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.440> lot<00:02:20.620> smaller<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.160> lot<00:02:21.370> to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
about me and it's a lot smaller a lot to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.460 
about me and it's a lot smaller a lot to
eat<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:21.880> bit<00:02:22.030> easier<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> get<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> I'll

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
eat a little bit easier to get it I'll

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.809 
eat a little bit easier to get it I'll
show<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.830> get<00:02:23.950> both<00:02:24.040> them<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.610> need

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
show you to get both them in if you need

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:36.570 
show you to get both them in if you need
to<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:29.640> way<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> figured<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.300> out<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:36.160> nose

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
to so way I figured it out is my nose

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:46.170 
to so way I figured it out is my nose
ring<00:02:37.000> goes<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.900> my<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.230> hook

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
ring goes in this way so my little hook

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.070 
ring goes in this way so my little hook
goes<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:48.519> sad<00:02:48.760> face

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.850 

the<00:02:51.680> pointy<00:02:52.070> part<00:02:52.280> into<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.820> nose<00:02:53.860> now

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the pointy part into my nose now

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.470 
the pointy part into my nose now
originally<00:02:55.490> when<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.670> first<00:02:55.910> took<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.240> out<00:02:56.330> I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
originally when I first took it out I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.310 
originally when I first took it out I
had<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.780> put<00:02:56.960> him<00:02:57.080> from<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> top<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:59.140> had<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> go

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
had to put him from the top I had to go

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.570 
had to put him from the top I had to go
like<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.650> put<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.100> hook<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.610> way<00:03:02.380> see

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
like this put the hook in this way see

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.980 
like this put the hook in this way see
hook<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:05.360> push<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.600> all<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> way

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
hook it in and then push it all the way

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.020 
hook it in and then push it all the way
in<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.400> changed<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
in but now that I changed it to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.850 
in but now that I changed it to
different<00:03:08.270> hook<00:03:08.630> after<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.200> did<00:03:09.380> that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
different hook after I did that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.860 
different hook after I did that
it<00:03:09.920> grew<00:03:10.430> healed<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.210> little<00:03:11.420> differently<00:03:11.750> so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
it grew healed a little differently so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.040 
it grew healed a little differently so
now<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.290> have<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.530> put<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.040> way<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.840> all

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
now I have to put it in this way so all

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.420 
now I have to put it in this way so all
I<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:17.170> take<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.290> hook<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.770> push<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.220> into<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
I do take the hook and push it into the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.900 
I do take the hook and push it into the
hole<00:03:21.160> see<00:03:22.160> now<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:22.720> pushed<00:03:23.720> into<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.080> hole

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
hole see now it's pushed into the hole

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.970 
hole see now it's pushed into the hole
and<00:03:25.910> then<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.090> just<00:03:26.240> turn<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.830> it's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
and then you just turn it so that it's

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.620 
and then you just turn it so that it's
flat<00:03:28.310> into<00:03:28.760> your<00:03:28.880> nose<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.450> push<00:03:32.450> up

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
flat into your nose and you just push up

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.820 
flat into your nose and you just push up
and<00:03:32.810> push<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.110> in

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
and push it in

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.620 
and push it in
now<00:03:35.490> I<00:03:35.550> know<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.760> make<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.030> look<00:03:36.210> really<00:03:36.480> easy

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
now I know I make it look really easy

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.350 
now I know I make it look really easy
and<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.080> know<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:39.210> going<00:03:39.330> to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
and I know that it's not so I'm going to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.480 
and I know that it's not so I'm going to
do<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.510> again<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.050> take<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> out<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.340> just

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
do it again for you take it out you just

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.040 
do it again for you take it out you just
pull<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.530> spot<00:03:43.800> against<00:03:44.100> rose<00:03:44.340> again

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
pull it out so spot against rose again

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.550 
pull it out so spot against rose again
and<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:47.600> hook<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.750> out<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.080> have<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.380> kind

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and you hook it out so you have to kind

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.790 
and you hook it out so you have to kind
of<00:03:50.060> twist<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:52.470> get<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:52.770> of

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
of twist it like this to get it out of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.850 
of twist it like this to get it out of
your<00:03:52.950> nose<00:03:53.240> twist<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:55.410> get<00:03:55.530> back<00:03:55.650> in

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
your nose twist it so we get back in

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.130 
your nose twist it so we get back in
again<00:03:57.050> find<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.140> hole<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.790> have<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.140> just

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
again find the hole and you have to just

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.980 
again find the hole and you have to just
push<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:02.010> hook<00:04:02.190> into<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> hole<00:04:03.000> set<00:04:03.450> its<00:04:03.810> in

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
push the hook into the hole set its in

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.390 
push the hook into the hole set its in
as<00:04:04.140> far<00:04:04.320> as<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.680> go<00:04:04.740> without<00:04:05.190> twisting<00:04:05.820> it

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
as far as it can go without twisting it

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.309 
as far as it can go without twisting it
you're<00:04:08.000> pushing<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.480> as<00:04:08.629> far<00:04:08.659> as<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.170> go

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
you're pushing it as far as you can go

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.460 
you're pushing it as far as you can go
out<00:04:09.620> twisting<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> see<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:11.480> then<00:04:12.170> once<00:04:12.319> it's

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
out twisting it see and then once it's

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.350 
out twisting it see and then once it's
in<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.890> kind<00:04:13.099> of<00:04:13.190> just<00:04:13.370> use<00:04:14.150> your<00:04:14.330> thumb

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
in you kind of just use your thumb

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.150 
in you kind of just use your thumb
against<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.140> flat<00:04:15.349> side<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.830> it

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
against the flat side of it

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.050 
against the flat side of it
and<00:04:17.079> push<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.109> into<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.500> hole<00:04:18.949> let's<00:04:19.699> flat

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
and push it into the hole let's flat

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.689 
and push it into the hole let's flat
like<00:04:20.239> this<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:22.639> just<00:04:22.699> push<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.699> know

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
like this and you just push it in I know

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.420 
like this and you just push it in I know
it<00:04:26.120> seems<00:04:26.389> really<00:04:26.570> easy<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.380> promise<00:04:28.190> you

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
it seems really easy and I promise you

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.180 
it seems really easy and I promise you
that<00:04:28.729> it's<00:04:28.910> not<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.389> easy<00:04:29.770> because<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.979> looks

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
that it's not that easy because it looks

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.270 
that it's not that easy because it looks
easy<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:32.240> really<00:04:32.720> not<00:04:32.840> easy<00:04:33.050> at<00:04:33.260> all<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:34.130> I'm

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
easy it's really not easy at all so I'm

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.950 
easy it's really not easy at all so I'm
going<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.490> take<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.729> one<00:04:34.880> out<00:04:34.970> again<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.900> I

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
going to take this one out again so I

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.150 
going to take this one out again so I
can<00:04:36.139> show<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.470> how<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.040> put<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> bigger<00:04:37.610> hook<00:04:37.850> in

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
can show you how to put a bigger hook in

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.189 
can show you how to put a bigger hook in
so<00:04:40.160> bigger<00:04:40.370> that's<00:04:40.550> not<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.300> easy<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.080> I'm

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
so bigger that's not that easy and I'm

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.730 
so bigger that's not that easy and I'm
fighting<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.590> have<00:04:42.740> trouble<00:04:43.070> just<00:04:43.100> showing<00:04:43.520> you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
fighting I have trouble just showing you

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.730 
fighting I have trouble just showing you
so<00:04:45.740> this<00:04:46.010> is<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.220> bigger<00:04:46.460> hook<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:48.530> bigger

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
so this is the bigger hook the bigger

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.680 
so this is the bigger hook the bigger
hook<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.220> actually<00:04:49.400> had<00:04:49.699> to<00:04:49.789> push<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.270> from<00:04:50.600> the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
hook I actually had to push in from the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.170 
hook I actually had to push in from the
top<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.330> put<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.630> hook<00:04:53.810> on<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.020> top<00:04:55.180> and

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
top so I put the hook on the top and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.210 
top so I put the hook on the top and
push<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.539> into<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.870> hole<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.410> then<00:04:57.800> twist<00:04:58.070> it

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
push it into the hole and then twist it

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.320 
push it into the hole and then twist it
around

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
around

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.559 
around
that's<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.379> side<00:05:01.650> feels<00:05:02.460> flat<00:05:03.300> against

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
that's on this side feels flat against

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.020 
that's on this side feels flat against
my<00:05:03.720> nose<00:05:03.930> like<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.759> sticking<00:05:05.759> out<00:05:05.879> and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
my nose like that sticking out and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.370 
my nose like that sticking out and
sticking<00:05:06.210> up

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
sticking up

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.770 
sticking up
and<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.520> take<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.820> thumb<00:05:10.060> against<00:05:10.630> the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
and I just take the thumb against the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.490 
and I just take the thumb against the
flat<00:05:10.990> part<00:05:11.230> again<00:05:12.360> push<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.480> into<00:05:13.600> my<00:05:13.810> nose<00:05:13.990> so

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
flat part again push it into my nose so

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.550 
flat part again push it into my nose so
the<00:05:14.620> hook<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.890> pointing<00:05:15.250> up<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.920> just

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
the hook is pointing up and I just

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.260 
the hook is pointing up and I just
twist<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.430> all<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.580> way<00:05:20.730> down<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.090> bottom

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
twist it all the way down to the bottom

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.820 
twist it all the way down to the bottom
because<00:05:22.200> that's<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.410> only<00:05:22.500> way<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.710> can

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
because that's the only way I can

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.450 
because that's the only way I can
actually<00:05:23.190> push<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.550> in<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:24.470> just<00:05:25.470> push<00:05:26.430> it

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
actually push it in and just push it

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.410 
actually push it in and just push it
into<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.790> hole<00:05:27.230> and<00:05:28.230> this<00:05:29.130> one's<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.640> big<00:05:30.090> clunk

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
into the hole and this one's a big clunk

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.980 
into the hole and this one's a big clunk
here<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.910> how<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:32.940> hits<00:05:33.360> against<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.750> inside

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
here so how that hits against the inside

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.879 
here so how that hits against the inside
of<00:05:34.020> my<00:05:34.140> nose

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.160 

and<00:05:37.889> say<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.850> inside<00:05:39.180> hook<00:05:39.420> will<00:05:39.930> twist

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
and say the inside hook will twist

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.290 
and say the inside hook will twist
around<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:41.580> kind<00:05:41.670> of<00:05:41.790> fiddle<00:05:42.030> with<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.180> a

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
around just kind of fiddle with it a

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.040 
around just kind of fiddle with it a
little<00:05:42.389> bit<00:05:42.650> wrap<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.830> up

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
little bit wrap it up

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.560 
little bit wrap it up
see<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.080> don't<00:05:46.230> make<00:05:46.470> this<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.620> really<00:05:46.830> long

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
see I don't make this a really long

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.629 
see I don't make this a really long
drawn-out<00:05:48.570> video<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:49.380> my<00:05:49.980> tantalizing

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
drawn-out video like my tantalizing

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.340 
drawn-out video like my tantalizing
coves<00:05:50.850> was<00:05:51.150> which<00:05:51.510> I'm<00:05:51.780> sure<00:05:51.960> guy<00:05:52.169> eventually

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
coves was which I'm sure guy eventually

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.629 
coves was which I'm sure guy eventually
boring<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.570> I<00:05:55.500> think<00:05:55.800> that's<00:05:55.980> about<00:05:56.100> it<00:05:56.430> if

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
boring and I think that's about it if

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.700 
boring and I think that's about it if
