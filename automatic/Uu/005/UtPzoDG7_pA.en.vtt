00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
one and you know I thought that the with

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.200 
one and you know I thought that the with
Parker<00:06:21.620> you<00:06:22.620> know<00:06:22.740> we<00:06:23.220> didn't<00:06:23.670> play<00:06:23.820> that<00:06:23.850> the

Parker you know we didn't play that the
right<00:06:24.360> way<00:06:24.510> those<00:06:25.230> are<00:06:25.380> two<00:06:25.530> things<00:06:25.560> obviously

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
right way those are two things obviously

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.030 
right way those are two things obviously
the<00:06:26.790> you<00:06:27.630> know<00:06:27.720> defense<00:06:28.320> having<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.710> react

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
the you know defense having to react

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.680 
the you know defense having to react
like<00:06:29.220> that<00:06:29.280> creates<00:06:29.820> offensive<00:06:30.390> rebound

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
like that creates offensive rebound

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.270 
like that creates offensive rebound
opportunities<00:06:31.350> neighbor<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.770> ones<00:06:31.950> where<00:06:32.220> he

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
opportunities neighbor the ones where he

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.770 
opportunities neighbor the ones where he
would<00:06:32.430> get<00:06:32.610> it<00:06:32.760> we<00:06:32.970> couldn't<00:06:33.270> capture<00:06:33.510> that

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
would get it we couldn't capture that

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.200
