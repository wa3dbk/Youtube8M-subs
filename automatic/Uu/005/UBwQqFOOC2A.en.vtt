00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.019
 vision of the flight in this we talk about 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.740
 abduction 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:15.000
 it sounds possible to you look there's a case yes 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.130
 very famous that happened here in argentina 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 end of the 90's or so 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.289
 when airlines and austral were in 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.259
 hands of the emptiers of Spain and 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.869
 good the flight Buenos Aires bariloche 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.110
 the commander of that boeing 727 plane 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.450
 of which an old plane that had three 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 turbines in the tail let's say two to the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.440
 sides of the fuselage one the tail good 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.890
 was doing a good bariloche 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.920
 commander jorge polanco and when is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.260
 approaching the airport already begins 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.720
 notice that the lights of the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.840
 airport because it was with the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.370
 dusk the lights of 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.310
 the city 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.490
 the airplane lights clink in 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.000
 both in the cockpit and in the 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.000
 cabin of passengers 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.470
 well that lasts a little while in the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.530
 moment that goes out everything approaches a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.500
 let's say how the source is much more 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 big a clear dish a dish that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.110
 will be supported was in the air and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.680
 changed according to the stories at least 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.280
 tells the pilot exactly changed from 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.380
 color let's say from a green to a blue 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 iridescent is pretty close to the ship 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 and then 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.790
 takes more height at a speed and in a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.420
 maneuver that no aircraft manufactured by 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 the man 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.610
 could perform the lights are turned on 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.860
 of the city he has to make 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.080
 return to the approach maneuver and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.330
 it ends up landing the creation contact 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.760
 close the third pitcher 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 to what was a flying object not 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.330
 identified to be but he 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.480
 he lowered the silo window 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 and also this very fact was also 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.069
 reported by a gendarmerie pilot 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.709
 that was in the air at that time with 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.250
 another plane and it's a case that was counted 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:36.330
 several times that even took for him 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:40.130
 exactly the same as the nearby one was 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.130
 pay taxes after the rest 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.830
 Besides George and a friend and good so 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.830
 as it has reported the well
