if<00:00:00.269> we're<00:00:00.570> trying<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:01.760> harmonize<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.939> melody

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
if we're trying to harmonize a melody

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:14.440 
if we're trying to harmonize a melody
let's<00:00:04.799> say<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.069> was<00:00:05.250> gonna<00:00:05.430> harmonize<00:00:05.910> this

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.540 

it's<00:00:15.450> important<00:00:16.109> what's<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:19.340> fifth<00:00:20.340> on

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it's important what's on the fifth on

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:44.540 
it's important what's on the fifth on
top<00:00:42.200> because<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.590> want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:44.040> sure<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
top because I want to make sure that I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
top because I want to make sure that I
have<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.420> concept<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.289> brain<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:47.010> where<00:00:49.489> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
have the concept in my brain of where I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
have the concept in my brain of where I
don't<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.480> memorize<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.079> finger

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
don't want to just memorize a finger

don't want to just memorize a finger
muscle<00:00:53.670> memory<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> students<00:00:56.329> learn

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
muscle memory a lot of students learn

muscle memory a lot of students learn
this<00:00:58.129> write<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> say<00:00:59.969> okay<00:01:00.239> can

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this write down like that say okay can

this write down like that say okay can
you<00:01:00.420> play<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> backwards<00:01:02.390> forget<00:01:03.390> where<00:01:03.570> they

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you play it backwards forget where they

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
you play it backwards forget where they
are<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.350> tells<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.100> haven't

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
are and that tells me they haven't

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
are and that tells me they haven't
really<00:01:05.700> learned<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.360> conceptually<00:01:07.140> they've

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
really learned it conceptually they've

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.750 
really learned it conceptually they've
just<00:01:07.710> learned<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> muscle<00:01:08.490> memory

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
just learned it from a muscle memory

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280 
just learned it from a muscle memory
simply<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> learn<00:01:09.960> where<00:01:10.200> the

I<00:01:12.880> can<00:01:13.390> play<00:01:13.570> whatever<00:01:13.750> fancy<00:01:14.200> stuff<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.740> want

I can play whatever fancy stuff I want

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.969 
I can play whatever fancy stuff I want
but<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:16.930> kind<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.140> hard<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.440> hear<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:17.740> I'm

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
but it's kind of hard to hear that I'm

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.460 
but it's kind of hard to hear that I'm
playing<00:01:18.220> over<00:01:18.550> this<00:01:18.729> board<00:01:19.120> well<00:01:20.050> if<00:01:20.260> I<00:01:20.409> know

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
playing over this board well if I know

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.230 
playing over this board well if I know
where<00:01:20.830> all<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.070> notes<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.400> my<00:01:21.520> C<00:01:21.729> major<00:01:21.909> triad

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
where all the notes of my C major triad

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.040 
where all the notes of my C major triad
are<00:01:22.570> really<00:01:23.020> well<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:28.150> sort<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.450> emphasize

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
are really well I can sort of emphasize

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.440 
are really well I can sort of emphasize
those<00:01:29.440> notes<00:01:29.770> even<00:01:30.520> though<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.820> may<00:01:31.030> play<00:01:31.240> some

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
other notes in there too that may be
