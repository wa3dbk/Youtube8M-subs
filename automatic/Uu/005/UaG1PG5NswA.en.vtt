00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.840
 hi hello everyone how good they are 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.000
 Welcome to this video once again 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.430
 where I want to share some 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.820
 little things that we usually do with 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.070
 our face they are very bad then 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.470
 and sometimes the worst part is that we do not even 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.869
 we realize what is not owed 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.569
 stop to your face eye and be careful with this 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.989
 take note then first of all 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:29.989
 scrub the many times I've seen 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.810
 people who with the misconception of 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.390
 Exfoliate the face is going to add damage 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.550
 with all the poor face then ends 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.770
 from the best very clean but 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.380
 they go in little by little mistreating the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.170
 skin of the face then the best thing is that 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.110
 if they want a deep cleaning either 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.200
 get products dedicated to that in 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.600
 the face care line or 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.270
 do it with natural exponents where 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.060
 so masks of more you can 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 remove them 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.280
 black fats and other things that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.810
 then do not walk around there they were a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 way very soft because that of 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.760
 scrubbing will not get anything else going to be 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.190
 that we hurt ourselves that we invite and that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.440
 provoke premature wrinkles then 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.780
 that does not use dirty tools and is very 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.630
 difficult especially when we already 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 we used to make up not super 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 very fast or to bring the makeup in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 bag and take it everywhere is very 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.910
 difficult to maintain our 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 makeup tools clean but 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.030
 this is a big mistake we make and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
 what 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.640
 and put health and beauty at risk 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.690
 of our face therefore there is 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.170
 keep everything as much as we can for 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.189
 brushes 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.189
 and applicators 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.780
 put even the same hands you have to 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
 keep them clean because all that then 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.030
 imagine the blush brush the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.370
 we leave there, I get the dust and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.350
 we take it out we apply it and we take it 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.970
 some sweat of the face we're going to 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.840
 leave et cetera then all this and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.280
 clean it very well not to be 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.560
 multiplying the germs and bringing 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.260
 more things to our face then eye 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.860
 with hoisting not washing your face is also 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 Another mistake is not washing our faces with 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.290
 Fre Alliance but also the error 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.580
 extreme is washing our face too much 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.710
 then you have to reach a point 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.290
 intermediate and above all use the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.510
 Recommended products or products 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 necessary if you do not know what your type is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.130
 of face if you do not have the economy to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.290
 Buy the brand or line 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.380
 specialized with you use a soap 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.010
 neutral is more than enough you wash the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.690
 face at least before going to sleep and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.360
 it is always important to remove makeup 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.060
 remember to wash your face 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.370
 with a clean face with that you're going to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.140
 help your skin a lot do not rest 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.590
 enough or not sleeping is also 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.240
 another error that in the first one affects us 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.820
 health affects our state 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.160
 emotional and also accept also 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.840
 what beauty is and then you have to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.570
 think about it very well if you're 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340
 revealing for pleasure waters because not 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.920
 it's just dark circles what's 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.440
 causing but not resting 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.100
 correctly do not let your cells 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 they renew that they rest that then all 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.440
 this action that is provided at night 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.790
 to revitalize them then not then 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.000
 every time we go to see more 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.470
 withered and well this is not nice 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.260
 well let's grow old 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.670
 prematurely and therefore not joined to this 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.410
 you also have to treat them very well 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.270
 regardless of what we do for 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 outside also inside not eat 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.070
 healthy do not drink water and all that are 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.069
 enemies of our skin and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.409
 which apply mainly 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.849
 we touch the face is also a way 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.639
 that many of us have if we do not give ourselves 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.709
 account even in one more we touch 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.489
 but we restore the face when 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.349
 we are played and we are on the street and 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.359
 with that we are contaminating a lot 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.310
 more our face we are with what 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.930
 we have in our hands sometimes we do not know 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.519
 nor the amount of germs that we have 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.530
 in the hands that we are driving that 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.049
 we are on the keyboard that we go in the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.630
 urban transport and so on and so find 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.979
 grabbing them in the face then like 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.440
 he told them sometimes not only is the 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.020
 mistake to touch us but then we dry 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.110
 he is one and we use the typical 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.910
 remove the fat and with this what 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.330
 Knowing how to get involved, many more 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.220
 germs on your face then if you have 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190
 that mania of cleaning the face 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.800
 to or with wipes 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.380
 and by the gene and cas or with some product 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.330
 Specialized avoid at all costs 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.280
 put your hands on your face especially 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.780
 where is it in the street and so good if 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.210
 it's also going to be another great breakthrough 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.560
 for the care of you and finally good 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.900
 unless you think of it 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.570
 some more out there with pleasure and I 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.130
 they write them we share them but good 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.060
 and my list is in using products 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.200
 appropriate is also important to use 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.380
 sunscreen with a protection factor 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.150
 solar suitable for our skin type 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.130
 products if we are turning to 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.590
 some specialized line that is for 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.480
 our skin is very different a cream 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.910
 for combination skin that a cream for 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.340
 dry skin or for oily skin for skin 9 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.340
 20 years for the future 30 that for 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.990
 culture 40 so you have to know if we're going 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.270
 to do do world lies and we're going to 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.390
 start playing with products you have to 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.520
 use 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.290
 suitable for our face to 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.830
 our age and for the circumstances 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.110
 so then good with these this 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.660
 recapitulation of what we should not 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.420
 do with our face I hope that 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.180
 let's take note there and let's go see 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.160
 that if we do not shut up and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.940
 so that we have healthier habits 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.310
 and above all as beneficial for 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.890
 us for our health for our 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.380
 face and they will see that we are going to 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.840
 see more beautiful and more healthy I hope 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.840
 that you like it and we continue seeing you chao
