00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 same source that it is that I am in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.329
 bassam kacem points miles retaliated is.com 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.489
 so you really mark exactly the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.840
 same thing as I scored there and I 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.340
 also wanted marked in the description 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 from the video just below if you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.039
 need to copy and paste 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 so added this source 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 in cydia then you wait a few 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 little moments while if there is a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 check the source and the game in charge 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.620

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.320

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 can notice that I have a new 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.710
 source here bassam kacem point mairi 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.630
 country break this point like the one that I 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.250
 just added so we go down all in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 down you go to the bottom of the source 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 and you are looking for syia acid package 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.000
 7 this one so you press the name 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 of the package to browse and if so 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.360
 him who will allow us to install 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 syria on our iphone 4 now you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 press the install button and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 then you have here the detail of this 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.049
 that he will install so the syria package 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 plus another who wants to allow us 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.590
 to dodge the authentication so you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 install this well it can take a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 little time now that if there 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.000
 is installed we have to activate it so in 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.409
 the settings you do not go 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 in the classic section of cyril you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 go to this one syria acid this the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.560
 section of the tweak that will allow us 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.210
 to configure syria so the iris dance 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.909
 elling you put aw series 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.899
 you confirm the activation is then 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.369
 that's what you have you can 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.409
 select for example the language that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 you want to use to please me 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.049
 will be french 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.549
 so we have exactly the same panel of 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.079
 syria configuration that one has 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 normally in the bone settings is 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.149
 except that it's in the dedicated section 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.219
 to tweak 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.659
 you can also activate the dictatorship 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.490
 if you feel like it and once 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.380
 no longer choose your language which you have 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.270
 like that a large list for example I 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 can tick French Canadian see 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.950
 so it's really not complicated anymore 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.209
 that these are the only rules 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.860
 that we need to do is here in 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.060
 proxy rise especially leave you as 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 me leave you his life of you do not 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.209
 tuck anything inside it 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.709
 does not need to enter the address of a 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.360
 proxy server for siri to work 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.250
 must then simply do a real 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.629
 sprint 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.489

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.750
 well configured one can use siri in 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.390
 now long the button 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.250
 Welcome to our iphone 4 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.410
 here you see that it works on to 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.730
 Siri interface and is pressed 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.050
 little question mark we have the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.370
 list of everything he is able to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.360
 do and all we can do it 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.830

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.170
 perfectly works syria on my 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.330
 iphone 4 which in addition I find answers 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.260
 rather quickly if we use them all in 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.000
 same time there may still be 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.320
 some small bugs but it works 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120
