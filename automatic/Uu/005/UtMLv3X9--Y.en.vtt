have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> solder<00:01:08.970> him<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:11.060> i<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.659> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have to solder him but i would just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080 
have to solder him but i would just
prefer<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.580> maybe<00:01:14.729> i'll<00:01:14.909> modify

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
prefer that but and maybe i'll modify

ash walled much thicker much harder to
work<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> off<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.000> rim

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
work with to get it on and off the rim
but<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:08.129> think<00:02:08.190> I've<00:02:08.340> had<00:02:08.459> any<00:02:08.610> flats

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but I don't think I've had any flats

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
but I don't think I've had any flats
with<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.629> thing<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.860> booked<00:02:11.039> me<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> lot

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
with that thing so they booked me a lot

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.100 
with that thing so they booked me a lot
of<00:02:11.370> time<00:02:11.640> frustration

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
of time frustration

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.569 
of time frustration
yeah<00:02:15.110> that's<00:02:15.439> that's<00:02:15.769> pretty<00:02:15.950> much<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.400> just

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
yeah that's that's pretty much it I just

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.130 
yeah that's that's pretty much it I just
really<00:02:16.819> wanted<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.239> highlight<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.659> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
really wanted to just highlight that and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.990 
really wanted to just highlight that and
if<00:02:18.469> anybody<00:02:18.769> has<00:02:18.829> any<00:02:19.129> questions<00:02:19.519> about<00:02:19.670> these

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
if anybody has any questions about these

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.569 
if anybody has any questions about these
things<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.569> mean<00:02:20.599> go<00:02:20.870> ahead<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.079> comment

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
things I mean go ahead and comment

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.709 
things I mean go ahead and comment
everybody<00:02:22.579> else<00:02:22.730> wants<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.000> know<00:02:23.120> how<00:02:23.239> far<00:02:23.480> you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
everybody else wants to know how far you

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.869 
everybody else wants to know how far you
can<00:02:23.930> go<00:02:24.109> and<00:02:24.319> that's<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.159> tricky<00:02:25.400> question

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
can go and that's a tricky question

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.420 
can go and that's a tricky question
because<00:02:26.590> well<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.680> depends<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.040> how<00:02:28.159> hard<00:02:28.310> you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
because well it depends on how hard you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.860 
because well it depends on how hard you
pedal<00:02:28.760> how<00:02:28.849> much<00:02:29.060> power<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.510> put<00:02:29.689> to<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
pedal how much power you put to the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.929 
pedal how much power you put to the
wheels<00:02:30.049> your<00:02:30.859> terrain<00:02:31.189> and<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:31.519> that<00:02:31.700> stuff

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
wheels your terrain and all that stuff

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.449 
wheels your terrain and all that stuff
but<00:02:32.209> just<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.629> me<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.530> instance<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:34.069> live

but the weather's been improving here a
little<00:03:01.220> bit<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.609> I've<00:03:01.669> been<00:03:02.739> taking<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.950> easy

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
little bit and I've been taking it easy

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.770 
little bit and I've been taking it easy
a<00:03:04.280> little<00:03:04.400> more<00:03:04.700> I'm<00:03:04.939> not<00:03:04.970> using<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.419> throttle

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
a little more I'm not using the throttle

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080 
a little more I'm not using the throttle
so<00:03:05.959> much<00:03:06.169> use<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.310> throttle<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.879> thing

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
so much use the throttle in this thing

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.940 
so much use the throttle in this thing
assignment<00:03:08.510> 900<00:03:09.079> watch<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.439> them<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.859> the

assignment 900 watch to them to the
motor<00:03:10.419> more<00:03:11.419> or<00:03:11.510> less<00:03:11.689> if<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.959> just<00:03:12.139> use<00:03:12.379> the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
motor more or less if you just use the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.530 
motor more or less if you just use the
pedal<00:03:13.370> assist<00:03:13.609> it's<00:03:13.879> 500<00:03:14.359> watt<00:03:14.480> max<00:03:15.909> but<00:03:16.909> did

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
pedal assist it's 500 watt max but did

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.250 
pedal assist it's 500 watt max but did
go<00:03:17.690> for<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> 21<00:03:18.260> mile<00:03:18.440> commute<00:03:18.650> last<00:03:19.040> Sunday

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
go for a 21 mile commute last Sunday

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.930 
go for a 21 mile commute last Sunday
running<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.409> I<00:03:21.650> think<00:03:21.979> power<00:03:22.430> setting<00:03:22.819> like

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
running and I think power setting like

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.899 
running and I think power setting like
one<00:03:23.150> or<00:03:23.299> two<00:03:23.329> and<00:03:23.859> until<00:03:24.859> I<00:03:24.889> got<00:03:25.069> back<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.609> hadn't

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
one or two and until I got back I hadn't

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.789 
one or two and until I got back I hadn't
lost<00:03:26.030> any<00:03:26.269> bars<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.810> battery<00:03:27.109> battery

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
lost any bars on the battery battery

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.879 
lost any bars on the battery battery
monitor<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.819> know<00:03:29.209> it'll<00:03:30.139> go<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.349> long<00:03:30.650> long

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
monitor so you know it'll go a long long

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.780 
monitor so you know it'll go a long long
ways<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.459> even<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.090> -<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:34.159> don't<00:03:34.430> even<00:03:34.579> break

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
ways and even in - you don't even break

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.199 
ways and even in - you don't even break
a<00:03:34.849> sweat

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
a sweat

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.170 
a sweat
really<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:37.159> do<00:03:37.340> hold<00:03:37.639> that<00:03:37.760> trailer

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
really so I do hold that trailer

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.379 
really so I do hold that trailer
sometimes<00:03:38.599> haul<00:03:38.870> propane<00:03:39.260> back<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.680> forth

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
sometimes haul propane back and forth

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.539 
sometimes haul propane back and forth
I've<00:03:41.900> probably<00:03:42.260> towed<00:03:42.650> 60<00:03:43.099> pounds<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:43.519> more

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
I've probably towed 60 pounds or more

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.550 
I've probably towed 60 pounds or more
with<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.780> know<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:44.989> feel<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.409> back

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
with it and you know you feel it back

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.599 
with it and you know you feel it back
there<00:03:45.620> but<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:48.260> definitely<00:03:49.220> held<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.489> lot

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
there but it it's definitely held a lot

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.699 
there but it it's definitely held a lot
easier<00:03:49.970> than<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.659> without<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.959> motor<00:03:51.409> I

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
easier than then without the motor I

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.409 
easier than then without the motor I
wouldn't<00:03:52.519> want<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.699> do<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:52.909> without<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.269> motor

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
wouldn't want to do it without the motor

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.050 
wouldn't want to do it without the motor
so<00:03:53.750> anyway<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.739> hear<00:03:54.949> my<00:03:55.129> waters<00:03:55.489> filled<00:03:55.879> up

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so anyway I hear my waters filled up

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.699 
so anyway I hear my waters filled up
there<00:03:56.239> on<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.419> tank<00:03:56.659> so<00:03:56.930> I'm<00:03:57.199> gonna<00:03:57.349> go<00:03:57.590> ahead

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
there on the tank so I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.099 
there on the tank so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:57.829> go
