00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
looks like a plug so perhaps reaching

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.060 
looks like a plug so perhaps reaching
off<00:02:39.720> camera<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.530> seeing<00:02:40.739> if<00:02:40.890> it's

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
off camera here I'm just seeing if it's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.600 
off camera here I'm just seeing if it's
going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> work<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.730> my<00:02:41.910> phone<00:02:43.310> well<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.370> suppose

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
going to work on my phone well I suppose

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.540 
going to work on my phone well I suppose
technically<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.180> could<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.630> got<00:02:46.530> my<00:02:46.650> phone<00:02:47.160> here

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
technically it could I got my phone here

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.140 
technically it could I got my phone here
will<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> fit<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> phone<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:50.400> will<00:02:50.670> not

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
will it fit in the phone it will not

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.080 
will it fit in the phone it will not
well<00:02:51.360> though<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:52.459> guess<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:53.850> more<00:02:54.000> or

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
well though I guess it's really more or

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.060 
well though I guess it's really more or
less<00:02:54.239> intended<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:54.989> perhaps<00:02:55.380> phones<00:02:55.800> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
less intended for perhaps phones that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.900 
less intended for perhaps phones that
use<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> stylus<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.380> bad<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.950> suppose

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
use a stylus it's not bad I suppose

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.520 
use a stylus it's not bad I suppose
though<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
though if you don't have the the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.830 
though if you don't have the the
practical<00:03:05.190> use<00:03:05.459> for<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.330> probably<00:03:06.570> aren't

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
practical use for it you probably aren't

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
practical use for it you probably aren't
going<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.080> pick<00:03:07.230> something<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.800> up<00:03:07.860> if

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
going to pick something like this up if

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.820 
going to pick something like this up if
you<00:03:09.330> do<00:03:09.510> however<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.200> phone<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.500> you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.800 
you do however have a phone that you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
could probably put this in and you can

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.120 
could probably put this in and you can
just<00:03:13.019> have<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.350> mascot<00:03:13.800> up<00:03:13.950> there

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
probably be an ideal a little

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.880 
probably be an ideal a little
collectible<00:03:48.120> by<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> way<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.290> rubbery<00:03:49.650> too

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
collectible by the way it is rubbery too

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.729 
collectible by the way it is rubbery too
so<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.250> not<00:03:50.370> gonna<00:03:50.549> do<00:03:50.880> too<00:03:51.090> much<00:03:51.209> damage

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
so it's not gonna do too much damage

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.930 
so it's not gonna do too much damage
although<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.829> don't<00:03:53.010> wouldn't<00:03:53.579> want<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.730> poke
