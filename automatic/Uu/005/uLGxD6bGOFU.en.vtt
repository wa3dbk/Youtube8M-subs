00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
actually get some frontcourt help now in
my<00:01:37.650> opinion<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:39.360> with

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
my opinion I would have to go with

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
my opinion I would have to go with
Damian<00:01:39.960> Lillard<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.829> point<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
Damian Lillard at this point in time a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
Damian Lillard at this point in time a
lot<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> people<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.509> Twitter<00:01:42.810> hit<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lot of people on Twitter hit me up and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
lot of people on Twitter hit me up and
said<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> same<00:01:43.950> exact<00:01:44.430> thing<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> don't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
said the same exact thing but I don't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
said the same exact thing but I don't
think<00:01:45.509> Bradley<00:01:46.049> Beal<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> his<00:01:46.829> own<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.310> has

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
think Bradley Beal and his own right has

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
think Bradley Beal and his own right has
four<00:01:47.880> fold<00:01:48.149> his<00:01:48.390> entire<00:01:48.810> potential

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
four fold his entire potential

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
four fold his entire potential
especially<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.369> fact<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.700> most<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
especially the fact that most of the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.539 
especially the fact that most of the
time<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.630> he<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.899> playing<00:01:52.229> off<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> ball<00:01:53.250> he

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
time that he is playing off the ball he

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
time that he is playing off the ball he
has<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> great<00:01:54.060> opportunity<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
has a great opportunity to be one of the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
has a great opportunity to be one of the
best<00:01:55.860> shooting<00:01:56.250> guards<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> NBA<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.840> the

best shooting guards in the NBA over the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
best shooting guards in the NBA over the
next<00:01:58.110> ten<00:01:58.439> years<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.579> stay<00:01:59.820> healthy

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
next ten years if he can stay healthy
