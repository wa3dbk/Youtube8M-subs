 others that are characterized by their high biodiversity of cultivated plants 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 for example the orchard

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.940
 varied subjects evidently voice a few mobile services of supplying

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.550
 pm agricultural input but also provides regulatory services 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.050
 for example 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.280

 PS, they are also very important, I think we have 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.110
 many kind of satisfactions 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.140
 by the cut in the elbow through contact with these countries 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.520
 that we like 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.280
 that provide us with well-being when they maintain a certain level of
