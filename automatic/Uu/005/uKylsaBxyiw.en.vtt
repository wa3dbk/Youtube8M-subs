00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.839
 when I want to say thanks now 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.839
 say what it is 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.849
 if so like once a month 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.849
 Now in this discipline period 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 Chechnya Central Camp Stadium 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.400
 answering the question this year 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.440
 such objects and was not considered 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 some means she helps 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.400
 current demand growth 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.410
 here you have to be very clear and so on 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 this way you can watch 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.340
 development industry industries 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 other players find the truth 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 forest d pounds 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.729
 for the first time in 15 seconds 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.260
 and other cars 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.200
 note the format of the nearest plans t.ch 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.310
 each 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.510
 I think this is also very important 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 do it all hands 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.120
 but as stated in the message 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.370
 22 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.730
 when making a decision 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.760
 many wonderful news people often 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.400
 it is clear that the indicator comes 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.410
 tagliavini 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.960
 as the author writes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 on the day of detention did not consider 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.409
 yes for us will be held at first 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.240
 stage 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 considering that in the future 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.090
 in the program also to citizens 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 Russia living in Georgia 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.030
 beginning she will create leaders took to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.020
 brake pedal Governor Mikhail 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.170
 less noted lyudmila fomin we 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.470
 We hope that this exhibition to replace 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.810
 one of them is in dire 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.680
 I think this lack 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.950
 whereby we found a way out 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.820
 I could not 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 apparently I know it 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339
 Tatar went further 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 among athletes became 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 Andrey Belyaev 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.159
 the third 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.889
 found a typo 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.999
 for this and started
