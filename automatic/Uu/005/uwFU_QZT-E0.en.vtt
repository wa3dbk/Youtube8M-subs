now<00:00:04.589> if<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.730> go<00:00:05.910> through<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.240> classification

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
now if we go through the classification

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.509 
now if we go through the classification
scheme<00:00:07.109> then<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.740> see<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.250> then<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
scheme then you can see and then the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.220 
scheme then you can see and then the
Treponema<00:00:09.090> pallidum<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.719> Treponema

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
Treponema pallidum this Treponema

pallidum is a causative agent of

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.470 
pallidum is a causative agent of
syphilis<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:12.960> now<00:00:13.380> syphilis<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
syphilis as we know now syphilis is a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.359 
syphilis as we know now syphilis is a
venereal<00:00:15.480> disease<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.260> also<00:00:16.560> among<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
venereal disease this is also among the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.029 
venereal disease this is also among the
sexually<00:00:18.060> transmitted<00:00:18.630> diseases<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.830> know

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
sexually transmitted diseases as we know

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
sexually transmitted diseases as we know
and<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.090> syphilis<00:00:21.660> disease<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.050> really

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and this syphilis disease is really

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.259 
and this syphilis disease is really
really<00:00:22.560> dangerous<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.880> disease

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
really dangerous because it this disease

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.460 
really dangerous because it this disease
usually<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.560> sit<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.430> just

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
usually do not sit for just just

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.839 
usually do not sit for just just
spontaneously<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.949> needs<00:00:29.160> time<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
spontaneously because it needs time it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
spontaneously because it needs time it
needs<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.480> incubation<00:00:30.810> period<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.560> hold<00:00:31.920> on

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
needs the incubation period to hold on

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360 
needs the incubation period to hold on
your<00:00:33.210> body<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.500> faster<00:00:34.920> primary

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370

environment feasible for them they start
to<00:00:40.739> grow<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> finally<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:41.969> produce<00:00:42.239> some

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to grow and finally it will produce some

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
to grow and finally it will produce some
symptoms<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.320> sometimes<00:00:44.010> no<00:00:44.250> symptoms<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
symptoms or sometimes no symptoms we

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
symptoms or sometimes no symptoms we
call<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.420> stage<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> primary<00:00:46.469> stage<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
call the stage is a primary stage of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610 
call the stage is a primary stage of
syphilis<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> begin<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> skin<00:00:49.140> lesions

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
syphilis just begin like a skin lesions

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.130 
syphilis just begin like a skin lesions
then<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> finally<00:00:50.670> grows<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.840> will

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
then it finally grows on and on it will

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.350 
then it finally grows on and on it will
produces<00:00:52.739> much<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.340> lesions<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
produces much more lesions and and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.500 
produces much more lesions and and
cramps<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> finally<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cramps and and finally it will go to the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
cramps and and finally it will go to the
stage<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.930> secondary<00:00:58.620> syphilis<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stage of secondary syphilis in the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.279 
stage of secondary syphilis in the
secondary<00:01:00.090> syphilis<00:01:00.239> stage<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.870> happens

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
secondary syphilis stage what happens

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.250 
secondary syphilis stage what happens
sometimes<00:01:02.190> fever<00:01:02.520> nausea<00:01:02.969> flu-like<00:01:03.660> symptoms

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
sometimes fever nausea flu-like symptoms

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
sometimes fever nausea flu-like symptoms
so<00:01:04.439> often<00:01:04.739> people<00:01:04.970> misunderstood<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> kind

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so often people misunderstood this kind

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
so often people misunderstood this kind
of<00:01:06.479> symptoms<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.990> flu<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:07.950> usually<00:01:08.369> do

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
of symptoms as flu so they usually do

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960 
of symptoms as flu so they usually do
not<00:01:09.540> treat<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.470> situations<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
not treat in those situations but this

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
not treat in those situations but this
lack<00:01:12.240> lack<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.350> their<00:01:13.560> knowledge<00:01:14.430> and

lack lack in their knowledge and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.140 
lack lack in their knowledge and

start<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> grow<00:01:18.750> again<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.290> finally<00:01:19.979> go

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
start to grow again and finally go

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
start to grow again and finally go
through<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> final<00:01:21.030> stages<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.479> tertiary

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
through the final stages like tertiary

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
through the final stages like tertiary
and<00:01:22.020> quarternary<00:01:22.229> stage<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.460> start<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and quarternary stage when they start to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
and quarternary stage when they start to
invade<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> tissues<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.860> degrade

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
invade the tissues and just degrade

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
invade the tissues and just degrade
those<00:01:26.460> tissues<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.320> sometimes<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.500> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
those tissues up sometimes they can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.319 
those tissues up sometimes they can
attack<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> neural<00:01:29.490> tissues<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> will

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
attack in the neural tissues and it will

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
attack in the neural tissues and it will
create<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> neurosyphilis<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> also

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
create the neurosyphilis that is also

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
create the neurosyphilis that is also
very<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:33.060> dangerous<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> distracting

the sexual contacts and that's why safe
sex<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.890> must<00:01:41.430> thing<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.899> preventing<00:01:43.439> this

kind of sexually transmitted diseases

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.310 
kind of sexually transmitted diseases
okay<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.450> look<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> morphology

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
okay now if we look for the morphology

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.120 
okay now if we look for the morphology
and<00:01:49.799> structure<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.970> trip<00:01:51.479> anima<00:01:52.130> strain

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and structure of this trip anima strain

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
and structure of this trip anima strain
and<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.670> find<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.240> organism<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.810> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
stained smear or by looking at them

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
stained smear or by looking at them
using<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> light<00:02:05.189> microscope<00:02:05.460> by<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> normal

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
using the light microscope by the normal

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.630 
using the light microscope by the normal
compound<00:02:06.869> microscope<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.770> need<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> visualize

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
compound microscope we need to visualize

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
compound microscope we need to visualize
these<00:02:08.849> things<00:02:09.149> only<00:02:09.330> under<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.229> dark<00:02:10.470> field

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
these things only under the dark field

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
these things only under the dark field
microscopy<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.670> need<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> make<00:02:12.450> other

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
microscopy so we need to make other

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
microscopy so we need to make other
field<00:02:13.080> darker

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
field darker

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230

tutorial<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.860> let's<00:02:26.070> move<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:27.000> we

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
tutorial now now let's move on now we

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.090 
tutorial now now let's move on now we
can<00:02:27.360> also<00:02:27.510> find<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.350> structure<00:02:28.680> using

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
can also find that this structure using

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.070 
can also find that this structure using
the<00:02:29.130> fluorescent<00:02:29.640> microscopy<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.780> tag

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the fluorescent microscopy so we can tag

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.100 
the fluorescent microscopy so we can tag
as<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> fluorescent<00:02:31.890> dye<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.520> uh<00:02:32.960> with<00:02:33.960> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
as a fluorescent dye with uh with this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.720 
as a fluorescent dye with uh with this
spirochete<00:02:34.680> cell<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.520> can

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
spirochete cell and then we can

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.570 
spirochete cell and then we can
visualize<00:02:36.120> those<00:02:37.250> fluorescence<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
visualize those fluorescence which is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.430 
visualize those fluorescence which is
coming<00:02:38.820> out<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.420> spirochetes<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
coming out from that spirochetes and you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370 
coming out from that spirochetes and you
can<00:02:40.590> look<00:02:40.740> at<00:02:40.920> them<00:02:41.160> okay<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.960> another

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
can look at them okay now this another

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.170 
can look at them okay now this another
important<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:44.010> about<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.460> strip<00:02:44.790> anima

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
important thing about this strip anima

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.200 
important thing about this strip anima
is<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.350> they<00:02:46.560> cannot<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.160> grown<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.820> vitro

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
is that they cannot be grown in in vitro

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.600 
is that they cannot be grown in in vitro
conditions<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.320> need<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.740> provide<00:02:50.310> them

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
conditions so we need to provide them

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.060 
conditions so we need to provide them
the<00:02:50.820> original<00:02:51.170> cellular<00:02:52.170> environment<00:02:52.350> like

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
the original cellular environment like

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.400 
the original cellular environment like
that<00:02:53.100> rabbit<00:02:53.640> epithelial<00:02:54.360> cells<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.900> they

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
that rabbit epithelial cells and they

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.070 
that rabbit epithelial cells and they
need<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.740> huge<00:02:56.250> amount<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.780> replication<00:02:57.780> time

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
need a huge amount of replication time

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.050 
need a huge amount of replication time
or<00:02:58.380> or<00:02:58.710> we<00:02:58.950> or<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.340> say<00:02:59.460> incubation

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
or or we or you can say incubation

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.560 
or or we or you can say incubation
period<00:03:00.420> or<00:03:00.600> about<00:03:01.350> 30<00:03:01.710> hours<00:03:02.280> or<00:03:02.520> more<00:03:03.150> than<00:03:03.360> 30

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
period or about 30 hours or more than 30

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.930 
period or about 30 hours or more than 30
hours<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.960> grow<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.530> reproduce<00:03:04.700> okay<00:03:05.700> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
hours to grow and reproduce okay and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.660 
hours to grow and reproduce okay and
most<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.110> them<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.440> facultative<00:03:07.950> anaerobes

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
most of them are facultative anaerobes

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.440 
most of them are facultative anaerobes
and<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:10.140> means<00:03:10.440> they<00:03:10.800> do<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.520> need<00:03:11.730> oxygen

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and that means they do not need oxygen

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.540 
and that means they do not need oxygen
for<00:03:12.660> their<00:03:12.870> growth<00:03:13.050> purposes<00:03:13.650> okay

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
for their growth purposes okay

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.229 
for their growth purposes okay
so<00:03:15.480> sorry<00:03:16.040> right<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.490> they<00:03:17.700> do<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:18.000> need<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so sorry right so they do not need the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.850 
so sorry right so they do not need the
aux-in<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.870> their<00:03:19.020> growth<00:03:19.200> purposes<00:03:19.739> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
aux-in for their growth purposes and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.830 
aux-in for their growth purposes and
they<00:03:19.980> can<00:03:20.160> eat<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> oxygen<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.600> spreading

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
they can eat if the oxygen is spreading

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.630 
they can eat if the oxygen is spreading
that's<00:03:22.020> fine<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.680> use<00:03:22.890> glucose<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
that's fine they can use glucose and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.580 
that's fine they can use glucose and
they<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> use<00:03:24.300> glucose<00:03:24.750> via<00:03:24.900> oxidative

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
they can use glucose via oxidative

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.090 
they can use glucose via oxidative
manner

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
manner

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.650 
manner
okay<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:26.970> another<00:03:27.209> important

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
okay that is another important

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.590 
okay that is another important
biochemical<00:03:27.959> feature<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.800> their<00:03:29.070> cell<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.640> as

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
biochemical feature of their cell and as

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.820 
biochemical feature of their cell and as
we<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.110> are<00:03:31.230> having<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.620> C

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
we know they are having the C

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.490 
we know they are having the C
periplasmic<00:03:32.310> flagella<00:03:32.540> flatulence<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
periplasmic flagella flatulence and and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 
periplasmic flagella flatulence and and
these<00:03:34.800> flagella<00:03:35.070> are<00:03:35.489> inserted<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.120> each<00:03:36.390> of

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
these flagella are inserted at each of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.020 
these flagella are inserted at each of
the<00:03:36.840> cell<00:03:37.080> end<00:03:37.650> or<00:03:37.920> cellular<00:03:38.280> ends<00:03:38.520> as<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.880> can

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the cell end or cellular ends as you can

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
the cell end or cellular ends as you can
see<00:03:39.270> under<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.200> outer<00:03:40.320> membrane<00:03:40.620> now<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.670> you

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
see under the outer membrane now if you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.040 
see under the outer membrane now if you
look<00:03:41.910> at<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> picture<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:42.810> more

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
look at the picture it will be more

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.620 
look at the picture it will be more
clear<00:03:43.350> then<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:44.010> look<00:03:44.400> at<00:03:44.520> this<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.239> a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
clear then now look at this this is a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.660 
clear then now look at this this is a
clearer<00:03:45.930> picture<00:03:46.200> as<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.530> can<00:03:46.650> see<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:47.400> this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
clearer picture as you can see now this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.580 
clearer picture as you can see now this
is<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.180> actual<00:03:48.480> body<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.870> spirochetes<00:03:49.440> which

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
is the actual body of spirochetes which

between this yellow and pink color

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.850 
between this yellow and pink color
region<00:04:00.360> which<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> periplus<00:04:01.110> mix<00:04:01.560> place

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
region which is the periplus mix place

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.040 
region which is the periplus mix place
this<00:04:02.489> periplasmic<00:04:03.000> space<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.600> containing

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
this periplasmic space is containing

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.620 
this periplasmic space is containing
this<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:05.190> long<00:04:05.550> flagella<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.420> see

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
this this long flagella as you can see

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.720 
this this long flagella as you can see
which<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.020> thus<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.590> attaching<00:04:08.280> both<00:04:08.520> of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
which is thus just attaching both of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.880 
which is thus just attaching both of
their<00:04:08.880> ends<00:04:09.060> now<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.260> important

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
their ends now this is really important

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.680 
their ends now this is really important
for<00:04:10.920> their<00:04:11.280> movement<00:04:11.760> because<00:04:12.360> if<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
for their movement because if the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.720 
for their movement because if the
produces<00:04:13.140> flagella<00:04:13.530> from<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.400> will

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
produces flagella from one in and will

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.380 
produces flagella from one in and will
go<00:04:14.940> to

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
go to

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.140 
go to
it<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.140> not<00:04:16.500> attach<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:17.970> not

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
it will not attach to the it is not

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.210 
it will not attach to the it is not
attached<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:19.019> outer<00:04:19.230> of<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> other<00:04:19.859> end

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
attached to the outer of the other end

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.570 
attached to the outer of the other end
then<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:21.209> type<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.450> qilin<00:04:22.049> structure<00:04:22.680> cannot

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
then this type of qilin structure cannot

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.370 
then this type of qilin structure cannot
be<00:04:23.760> achieved<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.419> they<00:04:24.600> need<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.050> achieve<00:04:25.289> this

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
be achieved so they need to achieve this

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.930 
be achieved so they need to achieve this
coiling<00:04:25.800> structure<00:04:26.130> for<00:04:26.340> their<00:04:26.520> movement

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
coiling structure for their movement

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.140 
coiling structure for their movement
then

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
then

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.879 
then
need<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.509> achieve<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:27.990> crew<00:04:28.259> like<00:04:28.440> structure

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
need to achieve this crew like structure

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.740 
need to achieve this crew like structure
for<00:04:29.070> their<00:04:29.250> movement<00:04:29.460> effort<00:04:30.210> for<00:04:30.540> that

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
for their movement effort for that

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.930 
for their movement effort for that
purposes<00:04:31.350> they<00:04:31.710> need<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.100> attach<00:04:32.400> both<00:04:32.699> of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
purposes they need to attach both of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.170 
purposes they need to attach both of
their<00:04:33.120> aims<00:04:33.440> with<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.699> flagella<00:04:35.699> ok

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
their aims with this flagella ok

flagella is coming out and it is just

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.499 
flagella is coming out and it is just
going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.430> touch<00:04:53.729> to<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> outer<00:04:54.210> membrane

going to touch to the outer membrane

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.070 
going to touch to the outer membrane
region<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.620> some<00:04:55.830> region<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:57.930> the

point of generation in this picture is

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.240 
point of generation in this picture is
zoomed<00:05:03.750> here<00:05:04.050> for<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.650> purposes<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:06.750> is

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
zoomed here for this purposes and it is

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.890 
zoomed here for this purposes and it is
it<00:05:08.250> in<00:05:08.460> turn<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:09.000> going<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> attach<00:05:09.630> with<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
it in turn is going to attach with the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.320 
it in turn is going to attach with the

other end of the bed of this spirochete

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.700 
other end of the bed of this spirochete
okay<00:05:12.539> so<00:05:13.410> this<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.800> morphology<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.630> this

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
okay so this is the morphology of this

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.040 
okay so this is the morphology of this
flagella<00:05:16.710> assembly<00:05:17.250> now<00:05:17.699> what<00:05:17.910> will<00:05:18.210> vary<00:05:18.510> to

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
flagella assembly now what will vary to

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.839 
flagella assembly now what will vary to
the<00:05:19.199> Borrelia<00:05:19.680> or<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.160> other<00:05:20.280> types<00:05:20.580> of

the Borrelia or the other types of

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.610 
the Borrelia or the other types of
spirochetes<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.810> can<00:05:21.960> see<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.289> number

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
spirochetes that you can see the number

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.439 
spirochetes that you can see the number
of<00:05:22.770> flashes<00:05:23.130> but<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.849> arrangement<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.330> the

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
of flashes but the arrangement of the

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.089 
of flashes but the arrangement of the
flagella<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.139> morphology<00:05:25.320> will<00:05:25.800> remain

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
flagella and the morphology will remain

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.820 
flagella and the morphology will remain
the<00:05:26.250> same<00:05:26.330> now<00:05:27.330> if<00:05:27.509> we<00:05:27.630> look<00:05:27.780> at<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.470> Trapani

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
the same now if we look at the Trapani

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.439 
the same now if we look at the Trapani
and<00:05:29.070> then<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.340> flagellar<00:05:29.759> components<00:05:30.330> or<00:05:30.419> the

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
and then the flagellar components or the

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.420 
and then the flagellar components or the
structural<00:05:31.020> proteins<00:05:31.530> are<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.979> same<00:05:32.220> like

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
structural proteins are the same like

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.700 
structural proteins are the same like
bacteria<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.060> we<00:05:33.180> have<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.300> flea<00:05:33.570> APM<00:05:34.229> and<00:05:34.260> we

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
bacteria so we have a flea APM and we

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.589 
bacteria so we have a flea APM and we
have<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.949> MS<00:05:35.190> ring<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.699> have<00:05:35.789> motor<00:05:36.060> we<00:05:36.570> have

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
have the MS ring we have motor we have

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.779 
have the MS ring we have motor we have
rotor<00:05:37.020> or<00:05:37.380> all<00:05:37.500> these<00:05:37.620> things<00:05:37.680> together<00:05:38.039> now

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
rotor or all these things together now

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.060 
rotor or all these things together now
if<00:05:38.849> I<00:05:38.970> look<00:05:39.120> at<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.479> Treponema<00:05:39.990> pallidum

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
if I look at the Treponema pallidum

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.649 
if I look at the Treponema pallidum
through<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.280> through<00:05:41.849> the<00:05:41.880> dark<00:05:42.419> field

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
through the through the dark field

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.450 
through the through the dark field
microscopy<00:05:42.930> we<00:05:43.320> can<00:05:43.470> obtain<00:05:43.919> a<00:05:43.949> slight

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
microscopy we can obtain a slight

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.680 
microscopy we can obtain a slight
specimen<00:05:45.090> like<00:05:45.270> that

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
specimen like that

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.600 
specimen like that
now<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:46.260> can<00:05:46.409> see<00:05:46.650> Treponema<00:05:47.099> pallidum<00:05:47.130> these

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
now you can see Treponema pallidum these

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.860 
now you can see Treponema pallidum these
are<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.849> screw<00:05:48.030> like<00:05:48.210> structure<00:05:48.570> as<00:05:48.630> you<00:05:48.690> can

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
are the screw like structure as you can

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.089 
are the screw like structure as you can
see<00:05:49.020> so<00:05:49.139> this<00:05:49.289> is<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.560> characteristic

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
see so this is the characteristic

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.189 
see so this is the characteristic
structure<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.580> spirochetes<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:51.330> can<00:05:51.479> see<00:05:51.750> you

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
structure of spirochetes you can see you

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.529 
structure of spirochetes you can see you
can<00:05:52.409> just<00:05:52.620> identify<00:05:52.830> by<00:05:53.580> looking<00:05:53.880> at<00:05:54.000> it<00:05:54.150> very

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
can just identify by looking at it very

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.800 
can just identify by looking at it very
very<00:05:54.900> easily<00:05:55.139> if<00:05:56.070> we<00:05:56.159> look<00:05:56.400> at<00:05:56.669> this<00:05:57.510> structure

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
very easily if we look at this structure

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.480 
very easily if we look at this structure
using<00:05:58.260> fluorescence<00:05:58.650> microscopy<00:05:58.919> actually

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
using fluorescence microscopy actually

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.939 
using fluorescence microscopy actually
it<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.729> much<00:05:59.940> more<00:06:00.389> attractive<00:06:01.169> picture

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
it is much more attractive picture

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.800 
it is much more attractive picture
because<00:06:02.370> fluorescence<00:06:02.789> is<00:06:02.940> always<00:06:03.240> very<00:06:03.690> very

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
because fluorescence is always very very

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.080 
because fluorescence is always very very
attractive<00:06:04.500> indeed<00:06:05.310> because<00:06:05.729> we<00:06:05.849> are<00:06:05.940> using

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
attractive indeed because we are using

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.480 
attractive indeed because we are using
two<00:06:06.389> different<00:06:06.570> color<00:06:06.960> in<00:06:07.199> this<00:06:07.440> case<00:06:07.680> to

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
two different color in this case to

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.760 
two different color in this case to
visualize<00:06:08.940> that<00:06:09.120> now<00:06:09.599> if<00:06:09.840> we<00:06:10.050> are<00:06:10.139> using<00:06:10.349> them

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
visualize that now if we are using them

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.710 
visualize that now if we are using them
for<00:06:11.039> different<00:06:11.699> purposes<00:06:11.909> for<00:06:12.479> staining

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
for different purposes for staining

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.230 
for different purposes for staining
purposes<00:06:13.320> it<00:06:13.650> cannot<00:06:13.979> be<00:06:14.130> stained<00:06:14.580> in<00:06:14.820> normal

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
purposes it cannot be stained in normal

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.560 
purposes it cannot be stained in normal
way<00:06:15.389> more<00:06:16.349> especially<00:06:17.000> this<00:06:18.000> free<00:06:18.210> polymer

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
way more especially this free polymer

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.149 
way more especially this free polymer
cannot<00:06:18.870> be<00:06:18.960> visible<00:06:19.260> using<00:06:19.590> normal<00:06:19.949> strain

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
cannot be visible using normal strain

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.620 
cannot be visible using normal strain
that<00:06:20.310> so<00:06:20.490> you<00:06:20.550> need<00:06:20.669> to<00:06:20.820> go<00:06:20.970> through<00:06:21.180> either<00:06:21.419> of

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
that so you need to go through either of

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.000 
that so you need to go through either of
this<00:06:21.810> techniques<00:06:22.229> to<00:06:22.349> visualize<00:06:22.800> this

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
this techniques to visualize this

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.510 
this techniques to visualize this
bacterias<00:06:24.229> now<00:06:25.229> the<00:06:25.289> pathogenesis<00:06:25.979> as<00:06:26.400> we

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
bacterias now the pathogenesis as we

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.370 
bacterias now the pathogenesis as we
know<00:06:26.699> they<00:06:27.000> are<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.210> virulence<00:06:27.810> factor<00:06:28.229> so

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
know they are the virulence factor so

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.080 
know they are the virulence factor so
what<00:06:28.560> are<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.860> virulence<00:06:29.220> factors<00:06:29.669> for<00:06:29.880> the

the adhesive proteins are going to

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.470 
the adhesive proteins are going to
promote<00:06:38.250> the<00:06:38.460> adherence<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:39.029> the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
host cell then they are producing

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.160 
host cell then they are producing
hyaluronidase<00:06:42.240> which<00:06:42.570> will<00:06:42.720> which<00:06:43.140> will

degrade the hyaluronic acid present in

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.330 
degrade the hyaluronic acid present in
the<00:06:45.780> tissue<00:06:45.960> lining<00:06:46.260> and<00:06:46.620> will<00:06:46.860> degrade<00:06:47.040> the

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
the tissue lining and will degrade the

the<00:06:50.220> third<00:06:50.490> thing<00:06:50.700> is<00:06:50.760> that<00:06:50.880> they<00:06:51.500> have<00:06:52.500> the

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
the third thing is that they have the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.320 
the third thing is that they have the
coating<00:06:53.010> with<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.400> host<00:06:53.610> cell<00:06:53.820> fibronectin

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
the host immune response of infection so

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.610 
the host immune response of infection so
what<00:07:05.970> happens<00:07:06.360> when<00:07:06.510> they<00:07:06.660> enter<00:07:06.930> inside<00:07:07.470> the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
what happens when they enter inside the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.560 
what happens when they enter inside the
tissue<00:07:07.830> lining<00:07:08.160> by<00:07:08.880> degrading<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.390> tissue

they cover themselves using fibronectin

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.100 
they cover themselves using fibronectin
which<00:07:14.460> is<00:07:14.580> which<00:07:15.120> which<00:07:15.330> they<00:07:15.480> take<00:07:15.630> from<00:07:15.810> host

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
which is which which they take from host

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.990 
which is which which they take from host
cell<00:07:16.410> and<00:07:16.620> then<00:07:16.950> the<00:07:17.070> host<00:07:17.280> cell<00:07:17.580> machinery

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
cell and then the host cell machinery

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.420 
cell and then the host cell machinery
host<00:07:18.330> cell<00:07:18.570> immune<00:07:19.110> system<00:07:19.530> is<00:07:19.680> going<00:07:20.010> is

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
host cell immune system is going is

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.610 
host cell immune system is going is
trying<00:07:20.760> to<00:07:20.940> go<00:07:21.060> against<00:07:21.450> them<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:21.810> that<00:07:21.900> in

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
trying to go against them and that in

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.540 
trying to go against them and that in
turn<00:07:22.920> further<00:07:23.850> weakened<00:07:24.420> down<00:07:25.160> the<00:07:26.160> disease

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
turn further weakened down the disease

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.490 
turn further weakened down the disease
condition<00:07:26.970> further<00:07:27.210> amplify<00:07:28.050> the<00:07:28.110> disease

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
condition further amplify the disease

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.700 
condition further amplify the disease
condition<00:07:28.980> of<00:07:29.070> the<00:07:29.220> host<00:07:29.430> okay<00:07:30.290> so<00:07:31.290> if<00:07:31.440> we<00:07:31.530> look

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
condition of the host okay so if we look

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.290 
condition of the host okay so if we look
at<00:07:31.800> the<00:07:31.950> epidemiology<00:07:32.250> that<00:07:32.730> you<00:07:32.910> can<00:07:33.060> find

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
at the epidemiology that you can find

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.930 
at the epidemiology that you can find
this<00:07:33.480> these<00:07:34.080> this<00:07:34.470> trip<00:07:34.650> anima<00:07:34.920> pallidum<00:07:35.760> is

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
this these this trip anima pallidum is

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.270 
this these this trip anima pallidum is
having<00:07:36.600> only<00:07:36.780> one<00:07:37.080> host<00:07:37.350> F<00:07:37.590> on<00:07:37.800> nature<00:07:38.100> which

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
having only one host F on nature which

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.800 
having only one host F on nature which
is<00:07:38.400> a<00:07:38.430> human<00:07:38.880> so<00:07:39.030> though<00:07:39.210> there<00:07:39.510> are<00:07:39.660> no

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
is a human so though there are no

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.690 
is a human so though there are no
reserved<00:07:40.170> ear<00:07:40.320> holes<00:07:40.530> so<00:07:40.710> the<00:07:40.860> only<00:07:41.070> way<00:07:41.430> of

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700 
reserved ear holes so the only way of

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.670 
reserved ear holes so the only way of
having<00:07:42.180> this<00:07:42.300> disease<00:07:42.510> is<00:07:42.780> the<00:07:42.930> contamination

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 
having this disease is the contamination

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.460 
having this disease is the contamination
with<00:07:44.160> any<00:07:44.400> human<00:07:44.730> materials<00:07:45.480> okay<00:07:45.960> so<00:07:46.170> the

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.470 
with any human materials okay so the

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.230 
with any human materials okay so the
first<00:07:46.680> and<00:07:46.980> foremost<00:07:47.010> thing<00:07:47.610> for<00:07:47.880> that<00:07:48.030> is<00:07:48.210> a

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
first and foremost thing for that is a

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.190 
first and foremost thing for that is a
safe<00:07:48.600> sex<00:07:48.960> or<00:07:49.140> to<00:07:49.560> prevent<00:07:50.310> this<00:07:50.520> kind<00:07:50.730> of

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.200 
safe sex or to prevent this kind of

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.140 
safe sex or to prevent this kind of
diseases<00:07:52.200> like<00:07:52.440> syphilis<00:07:52.740> okay<00:07:53.310> so<00:07:53.820> that's

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.150 
diseases like syphilis okay so that's

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.160 
diseases like syphilis okay so that's
that's<00:07:54.870> about<00:07:55.230> this
