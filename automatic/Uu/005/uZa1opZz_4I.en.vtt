00:01:46.069 --> 00:02:00.399
 carbohydrates on markt.de 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:02:01.830
 sugar a lot but I still want to 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.370

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:37.680
 however, are the now actually 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:41.780
 order-trust most give 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.990

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.060
 nicotine in it and should chase the six 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.470
 The farmers do not eat anymore during the day 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.940
 on the 14 we stop welding 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:03.080
 more 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 what does not find people's details 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.840
 it looks like this looks real from the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.070
 meat what I say for 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.870

 Who should I do this everyday? 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.860
 Deficit now has to do something on the way 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.820
 is required, or it might someday 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:46.140
 holding back while eating 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:56.930
 unabridged regulate 33 seconds 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:13.040
 you can please the few minutes 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:13.040
 answers but little is true is strict 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:25.350
 11 percent do not know 10 keywords 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.200
 sometimes even if you hear from sophie 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.260
 would take such important ones around 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.770
 then park themselves 50 60 70 degrees on 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.080
 in her yesterday and tell how 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.280
 you in five colors and thus to have 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.060
 that a trademark of four paws 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:54.169
 and get pimples 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:57.180
 too many artificial vitamins 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:01.409
 Do not buy anything anymore 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 feels apropos tenor balance as 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.370
 principle has currently also in the city 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:16.849
 not expensive 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:23.189
 others' heads lacked these questions 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:24.360
 have to learn what we do with 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:28.349
 meat is and so on and so forth 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.389
 but generally should discover continent 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.930
 drive down here and look that we 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.930
 quality 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.600
 performance society is somehow 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.870
 no idea, yes I 'm fine so nothing 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.150
 say 100,000 euros in ten years 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.910
 I stress the students today 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.120
 under the here and now the moment 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.880
 counts what you now you're making pure 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.890
 kassel and not even the people the 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:09.110
 have body create it all 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:12.330
 there are 1000 less 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.650
 How should I say less successful 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.450
 fewer orders have been few 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.890
 have because this is all body 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.900
 Guys that I do not understand 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.320
 Sometimes the people say I have 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.590
 This typical channel is a mirror 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.590
