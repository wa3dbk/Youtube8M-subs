how<00:04:27.880> many<00:04:28.060> jumps<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.540> at

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:45.070

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.090 

for<00:04:46.080> what<00:04:46.740> was<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.950> score<00:04:47.130> little<00:04:47.370> girl<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:49.440> had

for what was the score little girl I had

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.410 
for what was the score little girl I had
30<00:04:50.550> let's<00:04:50.820> say<00:04:50.940> 10<00:04:51.150> 13<00:04:52.490> 16<00:04:53.990> high<00:04:54.990> /<00:04:55.050> 7<00:04:55.470> 1<00:04:56.420> it's

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
30 let's say 10 13 16 high / 7 1 it's

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.360 
30 let's say 10 13 16 high / 7 1 it's
just<00:04:57.510> this<00:04:57.780> again<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.530> driving<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:59.100> ice

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
just this again it's like driving on ice

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.790 
just this again it's like driving on ice
out<00:04:59.730> here<00:04:59.910> isn't<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.330> it's<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.380> figured<00:05:01.710> you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
out here isn't it it's in I figured you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.140 
out here isn't it it's in I figured you
know<00:05:01.920> because<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:02.340> heavier<00:05:02.730> so<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:02.970> thought

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
know because it's heavier so I thought

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.370 
know because it's heavier so I thought
you'd<00:05:03.330> do<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.450> little<00:05:03.720> bit<00:05:03.840> better<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.140> thought

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
you'd do a little bit better I thought

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.080 
you'd do a little bit better I thought

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
you'd have this buggy would have some

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.090 
you'd have this buggy would have some
traction<00:05:06.330> again<00:05:07.140> man<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.500> heard<00:05:07.620> my<00:05:07.800> engine

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
traction again man you heard my engine

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.920 
traction again man you heard my engine
didn't<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.430> yeah<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.240> thing<00:05:09.480> I've

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
didn't you yeah and that that thing I've

got<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.200> get<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.410> fixed

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
got to get that fixed

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.930 
got to get that fixed
and<00:05:12.600> so<00:05:13.050> anyways<00:05:13.560> but<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.400> went<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.760> long

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
18th by the 810 in the long jump because

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.910 
18th by the 810 in the long jump because
that<00:05:20.790> sucker<00:05:21.090> can<00:05:21.270> fly<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.260> it's<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.500> rocket

that sucker can fly and it's a rocket
when<00:05:23.070> it's<00:05:23.190> got<00:05:23.370> traction<00:05:23.700> oh<00:05:24.300> yeah<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.470> can't

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
when it's got traction oh yeah I can't

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.910 
when it's got traction oh yeah I can't
wait

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920
