change<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> upper<00:00:10.559> control<00:00:10.710> arm<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.309> gonna

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
change the upper control arm we're gonna

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
change the upper control arm we're gonna
have<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:11.849> apart<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:12.540> if<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.690> gives<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
have it all apart if not if it gives a

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.120 
have it all apart if not if it gives a
 you<00:00:13.259> probably<00:00:13.530> gonna<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.889> later<00:00:13.980> on

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
 you probably gonna do it later on

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.939 
 you probably gonna do it later on
anyways<00:00:14.630> let's<00:00:15.630> clean<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:15.929> let's<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.770> out

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
anyways let's clean up let's get out

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.439 
anyways let's clean up let's get out
there<00:00:17.160> let's<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.789> work<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.270> this

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
there let's get to work and get this

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.330 
there let's get to work and get this
 done<00:00:19.070> steering<00:00:20.070> linkage<00:00:20.430> off<00:00:20.640> here

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
 done steering linkage off here

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.910 
 done steering linkage off here
apparently<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.850> wiggle<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> pass<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.019> CV

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
apparently you can wiggle it pass the CV

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:38.060 
apparently you can wiggle it pass the CV
boot<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.939> you're<00:00:27.150> careful<00:00:36.649> that's<00:00:37.649> taken<00:00:38.040> care

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
boot if you're careful that's taken care

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.990 
boot if you're careful that's taken care
of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
alright let's see how well the strut

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.100 
alright let's see how well the strut
bolts<00:00:43.140> gonna<00:00:43.440> come<00:00:43.649> out

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.540 

walk<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> bit<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.620> frozen<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.309> let's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
walk that bit just frozen in that let's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:01.150 
walk that bit just frozen in that let's
move<00:00:50.760> buses<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> old-fashioned<00:00:52.079> way

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.619 

that<00:01:02.160> broke<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> free<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.149> let's<00:01:03.390> even

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that broke just free again let's even

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:26.480 
that broke just free again let's even
get<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> row

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.160 

next<00:01:27.490> step<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.060> three<00:01:28.360> bolts<00:01:28.899> for<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
next step is the three bolts for the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.199 
next step is the three bolts for the
strut<00:01:29.530> not<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:29.979> one<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.310> middle<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:31.149> the

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
strut not the one in the middle but the

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.270 
strut not the one in the middle but the
three<00:01:31.539> outside<00:01:31.689> ones<00:01:32.219> move<00:01:33.219> those<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.159> on

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
three outside ones move those now one on

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.350 
three outside ones move those now one on
the<00:01:36.340> back<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.819> just<00:01:37.000> went<00:01:37.149> through<00:01:37.239> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
the back I just went through the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.139 
the back I just went through the
entering<00:01:37.630> apartment<00:01:37.899> with<00:01:38.259> swivel<00:01:38.679> 8<00:01:39.429> 15<00:01:39.909> mil

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
entering apartment with swivel 8 15 mil

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.389 
entering apartment with swivel 8 15 mil
socket<00:01:40.420> will<00:01:41.289> get<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.590> last<00:01:41.770> one<00:01:41.979> off<00:01:42.159> kind

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
socket will get that last one off kind

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.100 
socket will get that last one off kind
of<00:01:42.459> awkward<00:01:42.729> one<00:01:42.880> hand<00:01:43.149> will<00:01:43.539> get<00:01:43.659> her<00:01:43.750> off<00:01:43.899> and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
of awkward one hand will get her off and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:02:12.030 
of awkward one hand will get her off and
continue<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.939> push<00:01:46.179> down<00:01:59.489> so<00:02:00.489> close

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.429 

oh<00:02:13.019> yeah<00:02:14.349> there<00:02:14.799> we<00:02:14.920> go

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
oh yeah there we go

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.580 
oh yeah there we go
not<00:02:17.439> under<00:02:17.890> any<00:02:18.129> circumstances<00:02:19.030> whatsoever

not under any circumstances whatsoever
try<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> remove<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.340> spring<00:02:21.670> without<00:02:21.939> having

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
try to remove the spring without having

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.479 
try to remove the spring without having
spring<00:02:22.480> compressors<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.189> could<00:02:24.189> probably

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
spring compressors on could probably

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.420 
spring compressors on could probably
most<00:02:25.000> likely<00:02:25.629> kill<00:02:25.840> yourself

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
most likely kill yourself

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.589 
most likely kill yourself
sometimes<00:02:27.430> getting<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.879> nut<00:02:28.090> off<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.420> top

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
sometimes getting that nut off the top

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.539 
sometimes getting that nut off the top
the<00:02:28.780> struts<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.470> gonna<00:02:29.650> go<00:02:29.799> as<00:02:29.950> planned<00:02:30.159> so

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
the struts not gonna go as planned so

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.839 
the struts not gonna go as planned so
we're<00:02:30.819> gonna<00:02:30.909> have<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.209> get<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
we're gonna have to get the

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.910 
we're gonna have to get the
grinder<00:02:33.849> out<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.209> cut<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> top<00:02:35.049> of<00:02:35.079> that<00:02:35.260> bolt

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
grinder out and cut the top of that bolt

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
grinder out and cut the top of that bolt
off<00:02:36.159> or<00:02:36.459> part<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:36.939> strut<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.659> get<00:02:37.810> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
off or part of the strut so I can get to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.860 
off or part of the strut so I can get to
spring<00:02:38.170> off<00:02:38.379> I<00:02:39.359> really<00:02:40.359> don't<00:02:40.540> know<00:02:40.659> how<00:02:40.810> much

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
spring off I really don't know how much

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.270 
spring off I really don't know how much
spring<00:02:41.319> tension<00:02:41.769> will<00:02:41.889> be<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.159> that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
spring tension will be on that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.210 
spring tension will be on that
strawberry<00:02:42.909> but<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.599> don't<00:02:44.560> want<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.769> find<00:02:44.980> out

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
strawberry but I don't want to find out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.399 
strawberry but I don't want to find out
so<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.849> tightened<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.569> this<00:02:46.720> brings<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.170> little

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
so I tightened up this brings a little

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.429 
so I tightened up this brings a little
bit<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.799> cut<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.250> rest<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.549> nut<00:02:48.819> off

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
bit so I cut the rest the nut off

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.020 
bit so I cut the rest the nut off
hopefully<00:02:50.439> it<00:02:51.129> won't<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
hopefully it won't be a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
hopefully it won't be a

my spring compressors on there it's
going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.400> slap<00:03:00.639> her<00:03:00.790> on<00:03:00.939> there<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:02.049> right<00:03:02.109> you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
going to slap her on there all right you

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.569 
going to slap her on there all right you
can<00:03:02.319> see<00:03:02.439> right<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.919> need<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.189> compress

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
can see right there we need to compress

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.069 
can see right there we need to compress
these<00:03:03.849> Springs<00:03:04.239> quite<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:04.629> bit<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.260> then<00:03:07.079> we

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
these Springs quite a bit and then we

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.490 
these Springs quite a bit and then we
can<00:03:08.260> put<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> strut<00:03:09.010> bearing<00:03:09.189> on<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:10.379> got<00:03:11.379> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
can put the strut bearing on I got the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.559 
can put the strut bearing on I got the
strut<00:03:11.799> bearing<00:03:11.980> on<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.639> I<00:03:12.730> really<00:03:13.209> don't<00:03:13.389> like

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
strut bearing on and I really don't like

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.830 
strut bearing on and I really don't like
doing<00:03:14.019> struts<00:03:14.439> at<00:03:14.650> all<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:18.840> definitely

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
doing struts at all it's a definitely

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.449 
doing struts at all it's a definitely
kind<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.109> a<00:03:20.199> dangerous<00:03:20.560> job<00:03:20.859> compressing

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
kind of a dangerous job compressing

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.030 
kind of a dangerous job compressing
those<00:03:21.579> Springs<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.120> tell<00:03:22.329> you<00:03:22.620> now<00:03:23.620> comes<00:03:23.919> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
top there I'm gonna try to use a pry bar

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.119 
top there I'm gonna try to use a pry bar
to<00:03:56.799> pry<00:03:57.099> that<00:03:57.129> into<00:03:57.549> place<00:03:59.799> thing<00:04:00.010> in

here we go then got

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.279 
here we go then got
to<00:04:24.190> make<00:04:24.310> sure<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.700> is<00:04:24.910> perfectly<00:04:25.720> straight

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
to make sure this is perfectly straight

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.740 
to make sure this is perfectly straight
to<00:04:26.500> go<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.830> otherwise<00:04:27.510> you're<00:04:28.510> gonna<00:04:28.600> be

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.790 

now<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.600> struts<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:04.020> place<00:05:04.260> just<00:05:04.290> make

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
now that the struts in place just make

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.740 
now that the struts in place just make
sure<00:05:04.920> your<00:05:05.070> bolts<00:05:05.400> tight<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:06.000> make<00:05:06.330> sure<00:05:06.540> your

end<00:05:11.910> my<00:05:11.970> video<00:05:12.390> on<00:05:12.570> replacing<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.200> strut

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
end my video on replacing the strut

personally if I was to do it again I'd

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.130 
personally if I was to do it again I'd
probably<00:05:17.610> just<00:05:17.850> order<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.420> whole<00:05:18.630> complete

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140
