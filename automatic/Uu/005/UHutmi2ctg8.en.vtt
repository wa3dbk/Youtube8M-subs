added<00:02:56.200> per<00:02:56.380> turn<00:02:56.590> obviously<00:02:57.220> there's<00:02:57.370> a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
added per turn obviously there's a

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.910 
added per turn obviously there's a
maximum<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.940> five<00:02:58.209> but<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.650> need<00:02:59.830> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
maximum of five but you just need to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.320 
maximum of five but you just need to
have<00:03:00.010> three<00:03:00.250> counters<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:01.030> keep<00:03:01.180> on

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
have three counters and you just keep on

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.390 
have three counters and you just keep on
using<00:03:01.540> its<00:03:01.840> effect<00:03:02.080> once<00:03:02.290> per<00:03:02.470> turn<00:03:02.500> that's

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
using its effect once per turn that's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800 
using its effect once per turn that's
where<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:03.700> thinking<00:03:04.060> about<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.660> get<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
where I'm thinking about this can get a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.780 
where I'm thinking about this can get a
little<00:03:04.900> out<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> control<00:03:05.709> here<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.400> mean<00:03:06.670> that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
little out of control here I mean that

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.940 
little out of control here I mean that
affect<00:03:07.060> actively<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.750> once<00:03:08.050> per<00:03:08.140> turn<00:03:08.260> but

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
affect actively is once per turn but

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.290 
affect actively is once per turn but
it's<00:03:09.069> just<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.280> fact<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.880> know<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.150> can

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
it's just the fact that you know you can

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.360 
it's just the fact that you know you can
prevent<00:03:10.390> itself<00:03:10.870> from<00:03:11.110> being<00:03:11.260> destroyed<00:03:11.800> and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
prevent itself from being destroyed and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.309 
prevent itself from being destroyed and
it<00:03:12.940> gets<00:03:13.090> counters<00:03:13.510> from<00:03:13.750> whenever<00:03:14.019> your

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
it gets counters from whenever your

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.750 
it gets counters from whenever your
opponent<00:03:14.739> activates<00:03:14.860> stuff<00:03:15.370> essentially

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
opponent activates stuff essentially

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
opponent activates stuff essentially
unless<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.510> course<00:03:16.540> there's<00:03:16.930> mad<00:03:17.140> for<00:03:17.350> kozma

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
unless of course there's mad for kozma

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.170 
unless of course there's mad for kozma
because<00:03:17.860> it's<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.070> know<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.400> has<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.850> be<00:03:19.000> sent

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
because it's you know it has to be sent

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.250 
because it's you know it has to be sent
from<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.390> feet<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.750> great<00:03:19.959> but<00:03:20.110> that's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
from the feet of the great but that's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.289 
from the feet of the great but that's
really<00:03:20.799> cool<00:03:21.010> that's<00:03:21.459> all<00:03:21.670> we<00:03:21.790> know<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.120> of

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
really cool that's all we know as of

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.180 
really cool that's all we know as of
right<00:03:22.480> now<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> kaiju<00:03:23.110> archetype<00:03:23.680> but<00:03:24.160> I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
right now for the kaiju archetype but I

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.860 
right now for the kaiju archetype but I
think<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> really<00:03:24.970> great<00:03:25.209> addition<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
think this is a really great addition to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.600 
think this is a really great addition to
the<00:03:25.959> game<00:03:26.170> simply<00:03:26.860> because<00:03:27.310> you're

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
the game simply because you're

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.370 
the game simply because you're
attributing<00:03:27.880> your<00:03:28.209> opponent<00:03:28.600> stuff<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.959> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
attributing your opponent stuff and you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.560 
attributing your opponent stuff and you
guys<00:03:29.470> didn't<00:03:29.769> know<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.370> ocg<00:03:30.910> they've<00:03:31.329> been

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
guys didn't know in the ocg they've been

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.240 
guys didn't know in the ocg they've been
dealing<00:03:31.690> with<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.350> while<00:03:32.470> which<00:03:33.070> is

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
dealing with this for a while which is

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.460 
dealing with this for a while which is
the<00:03:33.370> cyber<00:03:33.640> dragon<00:03:34.090> finding<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.690> mask<00:03:35.230> hero

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the cyber dragon finding and mask hero

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.650 
the cyber dragon finding and mask hero
dark<00:03:35.769> long<00:03:36.010> that's<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.299> throw<00:03:37.329> out

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
dark long that's like if you throw out

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.870 
dark long that's like if you throw out
both<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:37.989> these<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.590> usually<00:03:38.829> win<00:03:39.190> games<00:03:39.519> but

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
both of these you usually win games but

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.310 
both of these you usually win games but
with<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.239> kaiju<00:03:40.450> they're<00:03:40.870> not<00:03:40.989> gonna<00:03:41.109> care

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
with the kaiju they're not gonna care

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.050 
with the kaiju they're not gonna care
too<00:03:41.500> much<00:03:41.530> about<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:42.100> because<00:03:42.310> they<00:03:42.880> can

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
too much about that because they can

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.580 
too much about that because they can
just<00:03:43.209> go<00:03:43.299> ahead<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.540> be<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:44.170> oh<00:03:44.320> I'm<00:03:44.470> gonna

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
just go ahead and be like oh I'm gonna

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.470 
just go ahead and be like oh I'm gonna
get<00:03:44.859> rid<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.070> your<00:03:45.250> dark<00:03:45.820> law<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.269> get<00:03:46.390> rid

get rid of your dark law I can get rid
of<00:03:46.540> your<00:03:46.660> infinity<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.410> gets<00:03:47.650> rid<00:03:47.890> of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
of your infinity it gets rid of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.340 
of your infinity it gets rid of
problematic<00:03:48.519> cards<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.480> are<00:03:49.600> just<00:03:49.930> really

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
problematic cards that are just really

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.720 
problematic cards that are just really
annoying<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.799> deal<00:03:50.890> with<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.220> think<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.579> is

splashing<00:03:57.579> are<00:03:57.910> their<00:03:58.060> archives<00:03:58.420> because<00:03:58.540> I'm

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
splashing are their archives because I'm

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.229 
splashing are their archives because I'm
thinking<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.620> know<00:03:59.650> um<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:01.180> still

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
thinking that you know um you still

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.120 
thinking that you know um you still
technically<00:04:01.690> have<00:04:01.810> your<00:04:01.959> normal<00:04:02.290> summon<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
technically have your normal summon the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.130 
technically have your normal summon the
turn<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.519> just<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.880> if<00:04:04.570> your<00:04:04.930> opponent

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
turn it's just that if your opponent

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900 
turn it's just that if your opponent
happens<00:04:05.650> al-qaeda<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.400> just<00:04:06.549> bust<00:04:06.670> on

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
happens al-qaeda you can just bust on

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.090 
happens al-qaeda you can just bust on
another<00:04:07.150> card<00:04:07.420> so<00:04:07.600> not<00:04:08.079> only<00:04:08.230> are<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.590> getting

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
another card so not only are you getting

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.160 
another card so not only are you getting
basically<00:04:09.850> free<00:04:10.120> cards<00:04:10.480> because<00:04:10.630> every<00:04:11.140> time

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
basically free cards because every time

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.410 
basically free cards because every time
you<00:04:11.500> go<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.489> every<00:04:12.850> time<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.000> activate

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
you go for the every time you activate

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.000 
you go for the every time you activate
cards<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.810> get<00:04:13.930> free<00:04:14.079> counters<00:04:14.500> on<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.829> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
cards you get free counters on this and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.740 
cards you get free counters on this and
then<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.459> card<00:04:15.670> basically<00:04:16.000> prevents<00:04:16.450> itself

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
then this card basically prevents itself

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.420 
then this card basically prevents itself
from<00:04:16.840> being<00:04:17.049> destroyed<00:04:17.229> although<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.130> can

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
from being destroyed although I can

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.800 
from being destroyed although I can
already<00:04:18.609> foresee<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.209> Costel<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.660> just

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
already foresee that Costel is just

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.170 
already foresee that Costel is just
going<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:19.989> bounce<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.349> thing<00:04:20.530> back<00:04:20.709> for<00:04:20.919> days

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
going to bounce this thing back for days

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.690 
going to bounce this thing back for days
nonetheless<00:04:22.180> I'd<00:04:22.750> really<00:04:23.140> get<00:04:23.380> rid

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
nonetheless I'd really get rid

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.310 
nonetheless I'd really get rid
you<00:04:23.970> know<00:04:24.030> cast<00:04:24.240> outs<00:04:24.420> not<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> problem<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.140> get

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
you know cast outs not a problem to get

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.380 
you know cast outs not a problem to get
rid<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.560> basically<00:04:26.520> comes<00:04:26.850> down<00:04:26.910> gets<00:04:27.210> run<00:04:27.360> off

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
rid of basically comes down gets run off

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.000 
rid of basically comes down gets run off
a<00:04:27.510> card<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.900> then<00:04:27.990> that's<00:04:28.170> it<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:28.890> like

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
a card and then that's it it's not like

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.090 
a card and then that's it it's not like
oh<00:04:29.220> my<00:04:29.430> gosh<00:04:29.640> Costel<00:04:30.240> locked<00:04:30.540> me<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:31.590> for<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
oh my gosh Costel locked me but for the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.290 
oh my gosh Costel locked me but for the
most<00:04:32.220> part<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.520> think<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:32.820> looking<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.180> be

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
most part I think this is looking to be

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180 
most part I think this is looking to be
a<00:04:33.360> pretty<00:04:33.600> good<00:04:33.780> arc<00:04:33.960> type<00:04:34.140> especially<00:04:34.680> if

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
a pretty good arc type especially if

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.370 
a pretty good arc type especially if
they<00:04:36.030> have<00:04:36.060> some<00:04:36.390> other<00:04:36.570> monsters<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.200> have

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
they have some other monsters that have

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.800 
they have some other monsters that have
other<00:04:38.100> great<00:04:38.490> effects<00:04:38.940> obviously<00:04:39.450> trimming

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
other great effects obviously trimming

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.300 
other great effects obviously trimming
your<00:04:39.840> opponent<00:04:40.200> stuff<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.500> really<00:04:40.650> good<00:04:40.770> if

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
your opponent stuff is really good if

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.740 
your opponent stuff is really good if
they<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.640> make<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.820> kaiju<00:04:42.090> that's<00:04:42.420> like<00:04:42.570> your

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
they can make a kaiju that's like your

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.240 
they can make a kaiju that's like your
opponent<00:04:43.020> can't<00:04:43.200> stop<00:04:43.470> someone<00:04:43.740> anything

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
opponent can't stop someone anything

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.550 
opponent can't stop someone anything
that'd<00:04:45.030> be<00:04:45.150> pretty<00:04:45.330> crazy<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:45.870> hope<00:04:46.350> they

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
that'd be pretty crazy but I hope they

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.780 
that'd be pretty crazy but I hope they
stay<00:04:46.800> away<00:04:46.980> from<00:04:47.040> that<00:04:47.280> kind<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.550> lock

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
stay away from that kind of lock

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.610 
stay away from that kind of lock
oriented<00:04:48.390> stuff<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.170> they<00:04:49.320> are<00:04:49.410> kind<00:04:49.590> of

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
oriented stuff but they are kind of

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.560 
oriented stuff but they are kind of
going<00:04:49.770> away<00:04:49.980> from<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.090> cage<00:04:51.270> work

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
going away from that with the cage work

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.820 
going away from that with the cage work
time<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.020> they<00:04:52.380> get<00:04:52.530> rid<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
time because they get rid of the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.500 
time because they get rid of the
