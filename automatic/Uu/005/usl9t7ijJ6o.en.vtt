this metal piece here then you're going

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.359 
this metal piece here then you're going
to<00:01:01.350> wind<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.100> thread<00:01:02.309> around<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:04.110> bobbin

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to wind the thread around the bobbin

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.780 
to wind the thread around the bobbin
several<00:01:05.369> times<00:01:07.100> make<00:01:08.100> sure<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.580> going

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
several times make sure it's not going

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
several times make sure it's not going
around<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> pin<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:11.900> but<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
around the pin at the top but around the
actual<00:01:13.470> bobbin<00:01:14.250> itself<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.700> snap<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
actual bobbin itself and then snap the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
actual bobbin itself and then snap the
bobbin<00:01:18.900> over<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> you're

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
because we're going to be practicing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:34.089 
because we're going to be practicing
with<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.670> spool<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.849> thread<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.540> your<00:02:24.720> bobbin

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.920 

and<00:02:35.099> then<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.519> just<00:02:35.760> cut<00:02:36.299> your<00:02:36.329> thread<00:02:36.719> with

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and then you just cut your thread with

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:47.249 
revealing these for paper so they don't

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:58.339 
revealing these for paper so they don't
cut<00:02:47.489> very<00:02:47.700> well<00:02:52.969> and<00:02:54.769> then<00:02:56.060> unsnap<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.480> your

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
cut very well and then unsnap and your

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.920 
cut very well and then unsnap and your
move<00:02:58.590> your<00:02:59.519> bobbin<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.659> look<00:03:00.810> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
move your bobbin and you can look and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.489 
move your bobbin and you can look and
see<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.139> thread<00:03:01.859> has<00:03:02.400> wound<00:03:02.900> evenly<00:03:03.900> around

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:04.499 
see that thread has wound evenly around

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.099 
see that thread has wound evenly around
your<00:03:04.799> bobbin<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.989> winding<00:03:06.989> your

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
your bobbin and that's winding your

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.560 
your bobbin and that's winding your
bobbin
