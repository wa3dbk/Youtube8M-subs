 director of the firm and flavio we can 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 say that in this new edition as 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.400
 always present to you accompanying 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.619
 what makes technology for the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.140
 textile sector correct one more year 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.140
 we are back in emitex this time with 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.599
 the novelty or surprise say a 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.330
 unusual machine for the market and new 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.550
 of technology speaking just of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.650
 this what powerfully calls me the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.600
 attention is this machine and the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.820
 characteristics that we are now going to tell 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.640
 that really through this machine 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.170
 We assemble a complete factory what 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.879
 makes any outfit that one 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.739
 want to realize what it is about 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.769
 correct that we have solved 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.180
 in ten meters by three wide 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.460
 fully automated robotic 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.530
 a cutting room for any factory 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.049
 from which the machine this is a 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.799
 original Italian machine the legitimate 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.150
 Original cutting robot from Italy and 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.530
 you want this machine as well 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.060
 We decided to solve a lot 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 problems because not only are we 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.170
 talking about ghana 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.820
 time as to what is speed 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.620
 and the amount of clothes that can be 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 perform in a day but also to the 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.340
 ease in handling the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.040
 it is not correct this can be operated 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 a single person with some assistant in 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.010
 the time to remove the garments 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.710
 cut but basically just one 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.280
 person resolves the cut from 5 to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.440
 10 thousand pieces or garments per day with 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.680
 a single person we are talking about a 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.560
 cost really very competitive because 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.870
 is offered to the market at 50 percent 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.310
 of what would be the commercial value in 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.580
 other places we are not talking 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.350
 really from a machine extremely where 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.780
 the benefit and the cost really look 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.680
 present in each of its details 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.380
 this is the best relationship 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.930
 cost-benefit because it includes three 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.260
 things in one this has been making a 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.450
 combo a paver a table and a 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.970
 cutting robot and this is the only 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 company in the world capable of offering 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 this solution there is no other 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.000
 company in the world that offers this 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.190
 three-in-one combo which allows 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.390
 lower production costs 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.190
 taking out an investment that recovers 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.710
 very 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 also and I would tell you that the investment 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.800
 is depending on the amount of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.270
 any factory garment can be 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.070
 recovered between a year and a half to two 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.510
 part again is a bit the 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.520
 possibility of offering advice 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 all the information that the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.730
 client who will acquire it for a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.740
 correct use and everything that is the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.390
 after-sales service also correct 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.270
 we are people who 20 years ago 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.780
 many years that we have been supporting 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.520
 technical and we are known not only in the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.770
 local place but in many countries of 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.810
 Latin America lav I want to thank you 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.240
 very much congratulate this one van gogh

 for this acquisition as we say 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.430
 not a clothing factory in one 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.350
 Very easy machine to be used and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.730
 with a really unique cost benefit 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.020
