so<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.750> primo<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.380> our<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> kilo

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
so this is primo this is our a kilo

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.579 
so this is primo this is our a kilo
solid<00:00:05.250> right<00:00:05.430> right<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.379> one<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.470> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
solid right right so and one of the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.500 
solid right right so and one of the
things<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:07.830> final<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.849> developed<00:00:09.420> like

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
things about final it is developed like

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.900 
things about final it is developed like
the<00:00:09.660> rest<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:09.990> products<00:00:10.320> animal<00:00:10.910> which

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the rest of our products animal which

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.740 
the rest of our products animal which
have<00:00:12.090> use<00:00:12.269> purpose-built<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.139> sound<00:00:13.380> quality

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
have use purpose-built for sound quality

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.689 
have use purpose-built for sound quality
but<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.990> great<00:00:16.350> all-around<00:00:16.560> driver<00:00:17.070> one

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
but it is a great all-around driver one

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
but it is a great all-around driver one
of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> nice<00:00:17.970> things<00:00:18.240> found<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.260> know

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
of the nice things found it is you know

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990 
of the nice things found it is you know
we<00:00:19.410> put<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.680> our<00:00:19.710> money<00:00:19.859> into<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.580> design<00:00:20.970> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
we put all our money into the design of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
we put all our money into the design of
the<00:00:21.180> driver<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:21.960> plastic<00:00:22.050> visor

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the driver and the little plastic visor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.970 
the driver and the little plastic visor
hiding<00:00:23.250> anything<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.910> bottom<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.660> actually

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
hiding anything or bottom it actually

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
hiding anything or bottom it actually
will<00:00:25.980> work<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.279> small<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.789> relatively<00:00:27.599> small

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
will work in small to relatively small

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
will work in small to relatively small
forward<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.680> you're<00:00:28.859> looking<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.250> 175

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
forward you know you're looking at 175

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.479 
forward you know you're looking at 175
times<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.430> 12<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> good<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:34.489> 141

great<00:00:35.760> things<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.239> driver<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.260> very

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
great things about this driver it's very

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.639 
great things about this driver it's very
efficient<00:00:37.950> well<00:00:38.399> typically<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> trade

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
efficient well typically when you trade

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.590 
efficient well typically when you trade

off you enclosure log on or sound hole
do<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.780> give<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> questions

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
do you give up a little bit of questions

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
do you give up a little bit of questions
I'm<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> driver<00:00:45.510> we've<00:00:46.500> actually<00:00:46.680> been

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
I'm in this driver we've actually been

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
I'm in this driver we've actually been

there's<00:01:24.310> more<00:01:24.520> rigidity<00:01:24.790> here<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:26.170> also<00:01:26.290> when

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
there's more rigidity here but also when

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.700 
there's more rigidity here but also when
you<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.520> know<00:01:27.580> anytime<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.360> join<00:01:29.170> we

you you know anytime you have to join we

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.760 
you you know anytime you have to join we
have<00:01:29.970> there's<00:01:30.970> there's<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:32.590> bit<00:01:32.680> of

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
have there's there's a little bit of

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
hair there I can read we want to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.310 
hair there I can read we want to
eliminate<00:01:35.860> possible<00:01:39.660> enclosure<00:01:40.660> volumes<00:01:41.140> for

eliminate possible enclosure volumes for

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.390 
eliminate possible enclosure volumes for
this<00:01:41.940> you're<00:01:42.940> looking<00:01:43.300> at<00:01:43.450> about<00:01:44.320> 0.65<00:01:45.010> for

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
this you're looking at about 0.65 for

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.260 
this you're looking at about 0.65 for
example<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.960> stuff<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.790> having<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.090> large

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
example very stuff but having a large

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.760 
example very stuff but having a large
voice<00:01:49.510> but<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.930> have<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.110> lot<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.380> magnetic

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
voice but we have a lot of magnetic

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.370 
voice but we have a lot of magnetic
energy<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.479> very<00:01:52.810> quick<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.229> very

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
energy and it is very quick and very

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.030 
energy and it is very quick and very
dynamic<00:01:54.869> there's<00:01:55.869> very<00:01:56.110> few<00:01:56.200> drivers<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.830> think

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
dynamic there's very few drivers I think

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.530 
dynamic there's very few drivers I think
that<00:01:57.160> like<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:57.970> we've<00:01:58.229> accomplished<00:01:59.229> this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.090 

this<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.869> ultimate<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.590> think<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.950> Hulk

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
this is the ultimate you think the Hulk

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.660 
this is the ultimate you think the Hulk
mode<00:02:06.369> uses<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> cast<00:02:07.150> basket<00:02:07.690> what<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.560> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
mode uses a cast basket what is a
