00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.979
 this country 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.340
 hi to all and lost will have so we get 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.910
 found today for a new 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.400
 video 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.779
 she may be a little strange for 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 some of you but it's true 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.050
 that it's still a big mystery 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.670
 so plan on this little history 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.560
 France is not really an easter egg 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.000
 no it's happening on the very dead map 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.919
 to call of duty kid if you want 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.220
 go check by yourself and so 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.800
 so next to the spawn of the ghosts if I 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.930
 do not fool me so there is in the street 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 normal a dog cadaver of which 15 h one 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.450
 dead cat and so that could be banal 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.900
 if in fact it was added so on the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.090
 map 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.380
 it was added by infinity ward during 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.110
 the last update that had 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.370
 particularly as a consequence various pages 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.840
 on glitches and everything but especially 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.180
 so they added the camouflage 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.680
 free Christmas and a new skin 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.840
 So for watchdogs for lou 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.400
 but I think you already know that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.100
 but not that they added elements 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.689
 two dogs even here is the second where 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.979
 on the very dead map then there is some 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.390
 may have on other maps for 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.400
 the moment it's not going to be discovered yet 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.530
 besides low and historical have been 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.780
 discovered by pgi his chain will be 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.189
 of course in the description and so 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.630
 so here I still do not know 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.240
 why they added his two dogs 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.190
 dead while that yet not finally that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.870
 no use but in any case it 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 never been done in the past by 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.650
 infinity see and besides by treyarch 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.370
 I do not believe so 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.260
 it's true that it's something 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.510
 strange enough we do not really see 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.860
 why they have reza and so I you 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.200
 puts an image on the screen that you 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.659
 will prove that it was added after 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 this update since of course so 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.260
 on this screenshot that dates from the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.880
 out of the game we can see that there is 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.010
 not this corpse is so there they have 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.170
 added and there are various theories that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.729
 see who are circulating about it so here is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.470
 bah do not hesitate to say your opinion in 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.000
 the comments what are you thinking about 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.830
 what's the point why do they have 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.270
 put it well here's the end of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.770
 this video I hope in any case she 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.150
 you will have pleased and then I tell you to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.150
 the next was the meaning
