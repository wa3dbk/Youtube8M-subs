00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.630
 In today's trick I'll show you how 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.910
 we can not get fruit oxide 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.250
 once peeled for it we're going to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.110
 need a bowl with water does not 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.770
 it is not so big 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.060
 the juice of a lemon 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.060
 and the fruit itself 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.830
 let's start by pouring the juice of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.830
 lemon to water 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.580
 then we will peel the fruit 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 I 'm just going to put a piece so that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.800
 this video is not too long 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.900
 buy a piece 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.930
 You see that it is not rusted yet 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.520
 I'm going to leave this piece out for you 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.710
 see how it is oxidized and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.890
 at the same time I leave you the pieces that are 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.679
 put in the water to then demonstrate 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.649
 that are not cooked to see the trick 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.069
 I need to spend the time I go to 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.840
 keep taping but later I'll put it 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.250
 in quick mode so you do not have to 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 be waiting all the time 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.619
 to know what 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.410
 If you want, you can see how the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 part of the apple that I have not gotten 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.750
 I have cut to pieces already is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 starting to oxidize 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.350
 allow 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.590
 I'm going to cut it too and the mind is the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 a 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.200
 I do not know if you can appreciate how it is already 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.930
 oxidizing the piece that I left aside 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.220
 and if we take any one of those that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.220
 they are in the water 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.810
 it's perfect 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.720
 we are going to be a little bit more 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.820
 so you can see it with more time 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.150
 and we can finish the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.150
 video 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.690
 I think after five minutes they have 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.760
 past you can see the apple difference 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.910
 that is not inside the water is rusty 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.980
 and the apple that is is 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.050
 perfect as I told you at the beginning 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.849
 it does not have to be such a big bowl 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.530
 or that it is crystal 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.720
 I've put this goal so you can 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.030
 see well in the video but with what 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.420
 put in a small cup or a small 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 bowl 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.810
 it's enough thanks for watching the video
