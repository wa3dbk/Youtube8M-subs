00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 to make this crispy nougat from 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.280
 chocolate we cut 300 grams of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.590
 bitter chocolate vegan without milk 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 we melted the chocolate each to its 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.710
 way 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.289
 you know that the chocolate is melted 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.189
 let's take three-quarters cup of 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:34.439
 syrup or corn syrup or honey in this 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.439
 case is corn and barley is a mixture 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.240
 and now we are also going to take 3-4 cup 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.670
 of peanut butter or peanut butter or 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.330
 as they call him and a lot of names 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.330
 extra 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.820
 we put a few cups in this case 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.820
 5 cup of inflated cereal 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.170
 the expert inflated since we have nuts 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.170
 chopped toast 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330
 and there's nothing right 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.490
 we distribute well all 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 we put it now tray of a paper 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.100
 we crush well when an object 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.430
 metallic so that it sticks all the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.430
 nougat 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 and now we cut it into bars 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.720
 of nougat or whatever you want and is 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.280
 great for this Christmas that 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.140
 they were asking for Christmas recipes 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.680
 as if we did not have in dimension 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.670
 vegan 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.670
 and that have been all 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 ah 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.209
 great 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.209
 they are rich
