cover pulled off doesn't look too bad I
was<00:00:10.860> expecting<00:00:11.340> worse<00:00:11.849> than<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> but

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
was expecting worse than this but

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.169 
was expecting worse than this but
everything<00:00:12.990> looks<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.880> clean<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:14.910> there

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
everything looks pretty clean in there

everything looks pretty clean in there
not<00:00:15.420> too<00:00:15.660> much<00:00:17.539> floods<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:18.840> seen<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.289> where

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
not too much floods I've seen some where

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.790 
not too much floods I've seen some where
they<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.830> sludged<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.539> all<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.960> there<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
they just sludged up all in there and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
they just sludged up all in there and
same<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> maybe<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.269> leaking

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
same with this maybe just all leaking

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140 
same with this maybe just all leaking
allowed<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.500> sludge<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.400> mean<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
allowed it not sludge but I mean it is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.560 
allowed it not sludge but I mean it is
95<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.230> pulling<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.340> fuel<00:00:30.240> injector

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
95 so pulling these fuel injector

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
95 so pulling these fuel injector
controllers<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.439> fuel<00:00:31.980> injecting<00:00:32.430> wires

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
controllers off or fuel injecting wires

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.910 
controllers off or fuel injecting wires
though<00:00:33.510> piece<00:00:33.840> broke<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.739> it'll

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
though piece broke off in there it'll

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
though piece broke off in there it'll
still<00:00:35.219> connect<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.480> worried<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> when

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
still connect I'm just worried that when

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.319 
still connect I'm just worried that when
I<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.149> see

and<00:01:47.940> original<00:01:48.840> equipment<00:01:49.220> Toyota<00:01:50.420> I'll<00:01:51.420> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and original equipment Toyota I'll be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210 
and original equipment Toyota I'll be
sealing<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.260> I'll<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.650> putting<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.010> thin

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
sealing it up I'll be putting a thin

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.610 
sealing it up I'll be putting a thin
bead<00:01:53.400> throughout<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> whole<00:01:55.190> rail<00:01:56.190> here<00:01:57.620> so

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
bead throughout the whole rail here so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.780 
bead throughout the whole rail here so
that's<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.220> now<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.760> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that's where we're at right now get a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
that's where we're at right now get a
little<00:01:59.910> video<00:02:00.180> before<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.990> button<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.440> back<00:02:01.650> up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
little video before I button it back up

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.630 
little video before I button it back up
on<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.820> side<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:04.040> was<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.280> worried<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
on this side I was a little worried that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.790 
on this side I was a little worried that
I<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.360> take<00:02:06.600> off<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
I was going to have to take off the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.210 
I was going to have to take off the
timing<00:02:08.520> belt<00:02:08.869> shield<00:02:09.890> because<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.010> kind<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
timing belt shield because it kind of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.710 
timing belt shield because it kind of
comes<00:02:11.430> underneath<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.300> was<00:02:12.420> worried

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
comes underneath here and I was worried

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.420 
comes underneath here and I was worried
that<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.960> might<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.760> bolt<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.780> end

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that there might be a bolt on this end

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.220 
that there might be a bolt on this end
but<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> look<00:02:17.910> they're<00:02:18.510> kind<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.840> reversed

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
but if you look they're kind of reversed

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.030 
but if you look they're kind of reversed
this<00:02:19.500> one's<00:02:19.740> set<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:21.110> same<00:02:22.110> exact<00:02:22.410> valve<00:02:22.770> is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
this one's set here same exact valve is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130 
this one's set here same exact valve is
turned<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.430> set<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
turned and set here and so there is a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.570 
turned and set here and so there is a
bolt<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:27.540> side<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.070> back<00:02:29.310> there

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
bolt on this side but not back there

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.700 
bolt on this side but not back there
because<00:02:29.850> they<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.270> kind<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> reversed<00:02:31.410> there

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
because they just kind of reversed there

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.300 
because they just kind of reversed there
just<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.040> that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
just like that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.190 
just like that
if<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.180> makes<00:02:33.390> sense<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.960> on<00:02:36.960> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
if that makes sense here we are on the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
if that makes sense here we are on the
downhill<00:02:37.560> slope<00:02:38.160> was<00:02:38.340> button<00:02:38.730> everything

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
downhill slope was button everything

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.050 
downhill slope was button everything
