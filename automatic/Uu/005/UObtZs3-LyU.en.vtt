00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
let me play the progression again this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.080 
let me play the progression again this
time<00:01:37.110> focusing<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.830> bass<00:01:38.070> notes<00:01:38.400> you'll

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
time focusing on the bass notes you'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.720 
time focusing on the bass notes you'll
see<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.800> different<00:01:41.250> bass<00:01:41.430> note
