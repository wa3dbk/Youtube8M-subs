then I'm going to take this kind of
brassy<00:01:38.500> gold<00:01:38.740> color<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.310> put<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.580> right<00:01:39.610> next

brassy gold color and put it right next
to<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.330> just<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.810> blends<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.410> with<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
to that just so it blends in with the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.650 
to that just so it blends in with the
other<00:01:41.950> shadows<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.030> have<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.450> nice

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
other shadows and you have a really nice

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.029 
other shadows and you have a really nice
gradient<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:47.140> I'm<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.410> take<00:01:47.500> nectar

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039

but<00:01:48.280> any<00:01:48.460> peachy<00:01:49.090> kind<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.720> warm<00:01:49.899> tone<00:01:50.200> will

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
but any peachy kind of warm tone will

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.430 
but any peachy kind of warm tone will
work<00:01:50.619> as<00:01:50.860> my<00:01:51.250> transition<00:01:51.610> shade<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:58.440> then

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
work as my transition shade and then

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.080 
work as my transition shade and then
with<00:01:59.680> whatever's<00:02:00.160> left<00:02:00.430> on<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> brush<00:02:00.789> I'm

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.060 
with whatever's left on the brush I'm
just<00:02:01.300> going<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.450> kind<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.840> connect<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.770> outer

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
just going to kind of connect the outer

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.580 
just going to kind of connect the outer
V<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.850> transition<00:02:04.450> shade<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.350> doesn't

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
V to the transition shade so it doesn't

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that but if you don't want to add this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.650 
that but if you don't want to add this
you<00:04:33.070> don't<00:04:33.250> have<00:04:33.400> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.620 

you

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.900 

so<00:05:38.230> I<00:05:38.260> could<00:05:38.620> not<00:05:38.770> decide<00:05:39.130> which<00:05:39.460> brush<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
so I could not decide which brush I

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.790 
so I could not decide which brush I
wanted<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.300> use<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.690> blend<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.020> all<00:05:41.170> out<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:41.440> I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
wanted to use to blend this all out so I

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.380 
wanted to use to blend this all out so I
started<00:05:42.310> with<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.460> sigma<00:05:42.910> 1<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.270> then<00:05:43.360> I

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
started with a sigma 1 and then I

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.180 
started with a sigma 1 and then I
switched<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.020> real<00:05:44.290> technique<00:05:44.800> space

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
switched to a real technique space

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.800 
switched to a real technique space
perfecting<00:05:45.820> foundation<00:05:46.000> brush<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:46.750> I'm

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
perfecting foundation brush and I'm

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.390 
perfecting foundation brush and I'm
pretty<00:05:46.990> sure<00:05:47.230> I<00:05:47.290> stuck<00:05:47.680> with<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:47.890> so

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
pretty sure I stuck with that so

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.910 
pretty sure I stuck with that so
anywhere<00:05:48.850> that<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.120> contoured<00:05:49.720> I<00:05:49.930> used<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.530> brush

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
anywhere that I contoured I used a brush

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.800
