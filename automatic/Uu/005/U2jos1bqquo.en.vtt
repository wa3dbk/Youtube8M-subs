00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
to protect a flag for example and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.800 
to protect a flag for example and
capture<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> flag<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.780> that

capture the flag you got to put that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.859 
capture the flag you got to put that
thing<00:01:55.020> down<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> equipment<00:01:57.390> category<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
thing down so the equipment category is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170
