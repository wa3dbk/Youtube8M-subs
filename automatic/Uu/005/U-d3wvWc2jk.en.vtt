this<00:01:58.740> video<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.670> focused<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.210> what

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this video is more so focused on what

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
this video is more so focused on what
the<00:02:00.659> actual<00:02:01.049> abilities<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.530> i'll<00:02:01.680> update<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the actual abilities are i'll update the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
the actual abilities are i'll update the
video<00:02:02.280> later<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> description<00:02:03.240> with

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
video later in the description with

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.410 
video later in the description with
actual<00:02:03.659> numbers<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> stuff<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.329> again

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
actual numbers and stuff but then again

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.609 
actual numbers and stuff but then again

says here sends all sent soldiers

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
says here sends all sent soldiers
towards<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> target<00:02:08.429> location<00:02:09.000> send

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
towards the target location send

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.180 
towards the target location send
soldiers<00:02:09.899> deal<00:02:10.319> magic<00:02:10.739> damage<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.129> all

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
soldiers deal magic damage to all

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.890 
soldiers deal magic damage to all
enemies<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.730> pass<00:02:11.970> through<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.450> apply<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
enemies they pass through and apply a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
stacking 20

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
stacking 20
slow<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.610> second<00:02:15.320> all<00:02:16.320> right<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
slow for one second all right so this is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.500 
slow for one second all right so this is
actually<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.310> only<00:02:17.430> level<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.910> build

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
actually the only level you can build

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
actually the only level you can build
you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.750> level<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.050> level<00:02:19.260> 1<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.650> these

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
you can level at level 1 because these

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.950 
you can level at level 1 because these
other<00:02:20.040> two<00:02:20.220> abilities<00:02:20.430> are<00:02:20.790> dependent<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.450> the

up<00:02:47.430> incidentally<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.330> only<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:48.660> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
up incidentally the only thing that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.150 
up incidentally the only thing that
increases<00:02:49.260> when<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.440> level<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.710> spell<00:02:49.980> is

its<00:02:50.310> cool<00:02:50.520> down<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.410> weird<00:02:52.590> but

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
its cool down so it's kind of weird but

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.100

absorbs a certain amount of health so

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870 
absorbs a certain amount of health so
I'll<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.519> can<00:03:32.519> actually<00:03:32.670> walk

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
I'll just do this I can actually walk

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.600 
I'll just do this I can actually walk
quite<00:03:33.180> far<00:03:33.420> away<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.110> boom<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.580> a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
quite far away and then boom it's got a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.670 
quite far away and then boom it's got a
really<00:03:35.820> big<00:03:36.000> range<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.989> could<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.410> really

I<00:05:56.220> guess<00:05:57.220> sort<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.520> like<00:05:57.640> syndra<00:05:58.270> and<00:05:58.510> heimer

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
I guess sort of like syndra and heimer

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.610 
I guess sort of like syndra and heimer
kind<00:05:59.380> of<00:05:59.470> rolled<00:05:59.680> into<00:05:59.890> one<00:06:01.260> syndra<00:06:02.260> heimer

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
kind of rolled into one syndra heimer

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.920 
kind of rolled into one syndra heimer
would<00:06:02.920> like<00:06:03.070> maybe<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.460> hint<00:06:03.880> of<00:06:04.090> lissandra

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
would like maybe a hint of lissandra

get ganked here I'm gonna send this out
and<00:06:12.460> push<00:06:12.670> it<00:06:12.820> away<00:06:12.910> and<00:06:13.270> I<00:06:13.570> am<00:06:13.720> jump<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.080> it's<00:06:14.200> a

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
and push it away and I am jump to it's a

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.770 
and push it away and I am jump to it's a
bit<00:06:14.380> clunky<00:06:14.620> but<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:15.940> know<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.180> works<00:06:16.570> I

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
bit clunky but you know it works I

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:23.760 
bit clunky but you know it works I
suppose<00:06:17.460> we're<00:06:18.460> just<00:06:18.490> going<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:22.650> sew<00:06:23.650> these

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
suppose we're just going to sew these

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.190 
suppose we're just going to sew these
soldiers<00:06:24.130> want<00:06:24.400> Hector<00:06:24.670> oh<00:06:25.420> yeah<00:06:25.720> well<00:06:25.960> let's

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
soldiers want Hector oh yeah well let's

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.480 
soldiers want Hector oh yeah well let's
be<00:06:26.320> just<00:06:26.470> really<00:06:26.800> close<00:06:27.040> though<00:06:27.280> it<00:06:27.340> looks

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
be just really close though it looks

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.390 
be just really close though it looks
like<00:06:28.350> see<00:06:29.350> how<00:06:29.410> the<00:06:29.440> duration<00:06:29.950> is<00:06:30.040> half<00:06:30.220> just

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
like see how the duration is half just

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.010 
like see how the duration is half just
because<00:06:30.640> these<00:06:30.760> things<00:06:30.970> pushed<00:06:31.570> our<00:06:31.840> is

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
because these things pushed our is

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:40.470 
because these things pushed our is
really<00:06:32.530> really<00:06:32.650> hard<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:33.040> guess<00:06:39.120> how<00:06:40.120> is<00:06:40.240> almost

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
really really hard I guess how is almost

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.940 
really really hard I guess how is almost
