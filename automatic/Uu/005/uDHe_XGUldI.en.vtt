00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi to all friends welcome to this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.250
 no videos are always black and today it leads 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.990
 the seventeenth episode the strongest 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.500
 of history 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.300
 I do not make this heading ornaments from 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:21.779
 very much, however, let's say I wanted it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 resume because I still have some 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.619
 masso to take care of then we will leave it 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 pending as in the past 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 ok we can the five decks I've chosen 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.570
 for this episode 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 let's start with the human friends deck 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059
 even if it is not really to be defined a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.950
 March as the strongest cards of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 this archetype or the seal hand 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 no less ice is played 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.020
 even in those who fire like the fire fist 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:00.289
 green or tris with your hands this 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.789
 case it's not that it's so old though 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.220
 insert because it is a deck that has 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.890
 indeed, potential is today indeed 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.530
 playable precisely because it comes out recently 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 long as a second deck we have the bear 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.220
 deck a deck that has been touched by 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.320
 panne 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 limiting the world bark however in compensation 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.210
 this bunch still the 3 theats and a good one 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 anti goal supported by drinking gorillas 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.760
 so I still consider it a bond is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.010
 playable also combinable with hands 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.550
 as a third bunch instead we have it up 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.860
 where each loch that a deck was 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.920
 let's say more popular in japan more 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 that here in the West and in practical the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.280
 combo was based on starting first with 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.190
 stencil set but forget in sect 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.560
 and revealing swords to stall in 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.750
 practice, the active tube of time is so 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.980
 the opposition could not fish with max col 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.260
 d'agnes larisa there is also on which I am 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.330
 I was doing that we'll be mask of darkness for 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.390
 re - use times the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.040
 so if we say this combo was successful 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.150
 it was really very hard for 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 the opponent being able to move forward 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.120
 today this boulder is playable as for 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.330
 fun because I have thoughts on it 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.360
 banned but playable as for fun 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.020
 because if we call it curioni we can give 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.110
 of type spiritual exhibits was plot and think 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.230
 al can be replaced with cards like 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.959
 drastic drop off and drop off 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.980
 now instead we have the file fist three e 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.000
 half that in practice this deck 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.489
 let's say this too has been touched 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.300
 stranded with the limitation of 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.160
 folder and denny chin dring however like 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.680
 deck is not bad at all 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 very combo which can be very annoying 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.720
 the opponent and I think that too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.600
 playable as a March tube instead 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.360
 we have the turbo badge which is a deck 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.050
 which is exactly how the name says 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.790
 summon base as soon as possible 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 this boulder relies heavily on the cemetery 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.460
 and in this way to make beautiful 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.670
 mainly malicious is used 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.990
 black spider both cemetery to do 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.520
 the deck can be more beautiful in a turn 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.270
 play with zombies or with chaos with 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.730
 Relax 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.000
 in short, there are many versions anyway 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.190
 thanks to bad this deck and playable 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.410
 badge as we all know the synchro that if 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.990
 it is not thrown down by many difficulties 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
 the opponent is fine guys 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.860
 for this we to yield stronger than 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.640
 it revive all there see the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.640
 next bye bye
