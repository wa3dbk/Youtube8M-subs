 Went to the now home water also amount is that my mother America 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.990
 I will introduce it because it is not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.190
 World version eight footers 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:27.560
 I mean Well I because Noir Complex is another super-standard mode 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:31.900

 It is a type of Frank rice 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.079
 Where I really like rice is 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.990
 The original is good but this one is much easier to throw 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 It's easy to throw and it will fly 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.360
 After all the world house 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.190
 It is true because it has inherited performance 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.800
 For example, Toka cold Kyu when it is steadily lowered the water temperature in early spring 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.560
 It becomes an abie folder and disappears quite 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:17.970

 Time to the that all of the fish have been above is atok car of this world samurai that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:52.659
 It's tough to say that 6 since I bought Namba 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.049
 Aiho is also poor batting also I'm like Te 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.340
 Because I work I can catch well in America 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:04.600
 But I think Japan may be able to catch more 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.960
 That's only because that time has changed and such songs are long 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.649
 Moon-kun 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.280
 Laugh say absolute Ya and barely can convince 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.959
