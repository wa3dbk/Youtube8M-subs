00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.450
 and before starting this video, I would like to 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.820
 tell you about the game channel happy 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.650
 kill channel 13 is just starting 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.080
 evolve so there is still not too much 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.660
 a lot of videos but there are a lot of things 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.449
 interesting I want to tell you here he 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.740
 passes amnesia examines tanks and 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.250
 fees tanks 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.140
 he also did several podcasts and I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.670
 I want to say that the channel is pretty 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.109
 promising so if you 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.770
 interested then go and 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.680
 subscribe 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.769
 well and now watch the video and enjoy 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.769
 view 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.480
 Good day to all this is Lara and 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 I 'll finally show you today 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 the very counter about which I tell you 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.540
 said a few days ago I 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.399
 I will divide the explanation into two parts I will 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.539
 tell you about the activation button 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.879
 euro reset button 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.739
 when we activate the green button 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.720
 the signal is sent here on this command 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.840
 block that sets the ration block 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.520
 here we go further mechanism itself 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.200
 counter let's understand how he 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.119
 working we have two rows of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.490
 command blocks 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.149
 the bottom row sets the block with 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.789
 offset 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.200
 one coordinate here that way that is 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.420
 Here is this command block installed 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.009
 covered 100 new here here this 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 command block sets to empty 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.720
 here this team block here and so 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.819
 further and the second row is the opposite 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.159
 installs an air unit with offset 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.690
 one coordinate in that direction that is 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.659
 this command god sets the block 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.330
 air here this here it is here and here 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.920
 so on accordingly when we 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.020
 we connect these two rows we get 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.750
 Here such an accountant must be filled in 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.759
 one thing when you connect these two 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 rows need to shift the row 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.020
 which sets the air blocks to 1 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.520
 to the right regarding your counter well 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.340
 or left looking in what direction 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.009
 you will run redstone block this 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.740
 need so that we do not dump 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.170
 each time the blocks that is when we first 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.179
 just send a signal here this command 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.500
 the block continues to activate and therefore 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.480
 the air block will no longer be here 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.549
 set and therefore we get 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.140
 the same counter which is not yet 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.570
 filled to the end will work like 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.700
 ordinary counter further everything much 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.530
 easier from here we have a signal 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.359
 repeater and through war inversion 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.540
 This is what the command block will be for. 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.579
 who installs a block of green clay 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.600
 right here let me have it now you 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.820
 will show 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.410
 personal blog and as you can see 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.300
 activated from the command block and we 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.960
 block green is set here 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.100
 It is probably worth explaining why I am doing 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.170
 connection through inversion not directly 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.230
 through repeaters of course then would 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 the mechanism of the pillar times the company but here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.730
 there is one but when the block runs here 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.410
 he manages to fix everything repeat or 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 and accordingly we get that 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.210
 at the first click the whole is filled 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.550
 counter scale and that we do not need well 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.890
 now let's look at the reset line 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.260
 here we have the following when 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.790
 activation of the red button we have a signal 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.890
 served 1 this row of command blocks 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.290
 which blocks just set here 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.700
 Air as we are at the same time 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.620
 signal here on this command block 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.690
 which sets the redstone block here 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.750
 here but since there is a delay 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.840
 in zero four seconds we have this block 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.520
 retracts and turns to go that we 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.890
 just activate this row from 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.380
 command blocks that remove all 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.900
 ration blocks right here dumping our 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.270
 counter on this in principle for today 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.740
 thank you very much for your attention if you 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.480
 ask you questions 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.430
 in the comments just do not forget 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.140
 leave your marks and if you 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.280
 really appreciated then sign up for 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.280
 channel all bye
