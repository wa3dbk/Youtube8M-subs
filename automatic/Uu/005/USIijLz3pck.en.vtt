00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.040
 Opening first 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.919
 Is it loaded against the competition? 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.139
 I would like you to show me roughly 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.729
 Kuwaguchi Kazuo 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.809
 I would like to see pets soaring 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.750
 The story is loaded on the Impreza 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.419
 It is asbestos 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.980
 The crime prevention effect seems to be great for that side's reference 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.029
 Add something when buying Airplanex 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.950
 I want it 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.230
 Good luck with that car stereo 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.990
 free 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.860
 If you think that it will add-here and assess 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.570
 I had English installed 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.020
 If it is true 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.400
 Consider one side 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.160
 I like being beaten, but hey 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.780
 It will be the first time that you are there 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 Because it will be said 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.900
 It is best to endure 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.620
 It depends on the large installation 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.130
 Products that were installed about five years ago 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.500
 Because there is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740
 British 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.450
 New beauty 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.800
 is not it 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.550
 mbc 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.400
 After 10 days 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.680
 The same fm tuner will be attached 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.160
 hair 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.620
 It was ja rank 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 It is Ina City 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.390
 East md thought a little 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.600
 with everyone 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 later 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.220
 2 Now 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.650
 I do not know what this house is 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 From among these fn 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 This is fine 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.480
 kfn 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.090
 I don't know how to switch to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 Yo 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.410
 Chuo Horse Racing also 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.439
 Great defeat or cheap 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 While this array keyboard 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.999
 The DPJs are prime ministers 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.189
 The atmosphere of the Hanoi club 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 Presentation meeting 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.519
 It is that sound effect 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.929
 Crawled 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.439
 Yutaka 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.099
 this is 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.319
 Less than 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.569
 I'm talking that it's a presentation 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.439
 Well like this 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.799
 It's supposed to be a bit of fun for that sound quality 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.659
 I am 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.269
 Well it seems that we can not use usb port etc. 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.510
 Even the serial one 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.749
 The law made wav for enactment 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.179
 mp3 or blemv 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.869
 It becomes a form that is not corresponding 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.509
 contemporary 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.230
 Turn on the car lights 9 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.249
 Night after getting run away 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.349
 I just want to shoot in the state 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.159
 The illumination is a bit about doing it 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.859
 There is a button from here, but it switches with this 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.669
 Thing 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.569
 Certainly so yes It is a little previous woman etc. 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.569
 If you apply for a little bit of atmosphere 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.659
 It is possible to write a book 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.499
 I will follow you 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 I am also shooting from a little night 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.419
 The company's current in the United States's 581410 minutes in the splendor 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.279
 I'm sorry but I'm sorry 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.599
 I want to be up until night 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.319
 Ema 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.569
 Hand in hand 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.430
 Net 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.819
 indeed 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.459
 Kansai TV 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.909
 -illumination 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.909
 But it feels like this 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 It is in the form of a foreign film goal 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.069
 Here 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.270
 Dad blockbuster 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.840
 on the other hand 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.349
 It is evaluated as it is 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.610
 Join company management 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.770
 It turned into a low price machine 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.439
 It is so from purple 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.240
 I will replace it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.819
 But the enemy castle 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.819
 I understood 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.729
 Eh these are Shiro 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.409
 In white 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.099
 Ekri 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.809
 He 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.139
 Another sale 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.370
 Another sale 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.370
 Winter color 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.870
 British 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.199
 This is the Olympics 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.900
 But various 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.509
 average 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.789
 purple 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.110
 Yeah 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.490
 This is 1 from the user 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.300
 I think that etv ten divisions should change 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.050
 Do it yourself 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.529
 In this way 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.919
 That 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.279
 What do you mean 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.279
 Say that it will change 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.979
 Come on, it will be installed 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.979
 That's right 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.080
 I do not know the official site 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.880
 other 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.319
 When that happens 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.620
 cd is long 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.830
 It will be 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.879
 Because 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.069
 f are various 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.219
 so 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.689
 It's almost impossible to do something Qualifying suspension 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.279
 I can not 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.419
 Because 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.419
 It is easy but equipped with Impress standard- 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.019
 You will be able to contest 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.889
 It's easy but I would like to ask
