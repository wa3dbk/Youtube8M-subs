I just wanted to show you how dry it
really<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.990> new<00:00:31.289> lawn

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
really really is this is a new lawn

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040 
really really is this is a new lawn
within<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.309> years<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.570> laid<00:00:33.840> on

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
within two years and this is laid on

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.430 
within two years and this is laid on
hard<00:00:34.800> pan<00:00:35.130> clay<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> couple<00:00:36.960> plugs

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
hard pan clay so here are a couple plugs

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
hard pan clay so here are a couple plugs
that<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.680> pulled<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.550> plugs<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> not

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that I pulled down here plugs are not

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
that I pulled down here plugs are not
going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:40.230> long<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.829> we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
going to be really long because we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.240 
going to be really long because we
remember<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.820> hard<00:00:42.120> pan<00:00:42.450> clay

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
remember this is a very hard pan clay

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.360 
remember this is a very hard pan clay
now<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.850> looking<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.370> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now what we're looking at here is the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
now what we're looking at here is the
tops<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.789> plugs<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> tops<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.020> plugs

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
tops of plugs see the tops of plugs

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.549 
tops of plugs see the tops of plugs
they're<00:00:50.039> nice<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.309> moist<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:51.780> grass<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
they're nice and moist this grass is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
they're nice and moist this grass is
nice<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.160> green<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:54.020> okay<00:00:55.879> now<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> see

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
nice and green in here okay now you see

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
nice and green in here okay now you see
the<00:00:57.360> clay<00:00:58.370> completely<00:00:59.370> dry<00:01:00.020> okay<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.800> water

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the clay completely dry okay when water

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
the clay completely dry okay when water
goes<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.030> soil<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.690> soil<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.350> your

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
goes through your soil the soil of your

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
goes through your soil the soil of your
lawn<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.610> does<00:01:05.790> what's<00:01:06.000> called<00:01:06.090> commonly

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
lawn it does what's called commonly

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.060 
lawn it does what's called commonly
within<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> industry<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.860> called

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
within the industry it's called

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.780 
within the industry it's called
fingering<00:01:08.990> water<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.530> path<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.189> least

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
fingering water takes a path of least

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.690 
fingering water takes a path of least
resistance<00:01:12.439> okay

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
resistance okay

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
resistance okay
so<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.119> done<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> aerated<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so what I have done is just aerated this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.719 
so what I have done is just aerated this
yard<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:18.060> those<00:01:18.330> arian<00:01:19.049> holes<00:01:19.549> are<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
yard all those arian holes are going to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.260 
yard all those arian holes are going to
act<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.090> individual<00:01:21.840> reservoirs<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:23.340> hold<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
act as individual reservoirs to hold the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
act as individual reservoirs to hold the
water<00:01:24.619> okay

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
water okay

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
water okay
and<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.820> happens<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.560> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> times<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:28.950> we

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and what happens a lot of times what we

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
and what happens a lot of times what we
use<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:31.040> allow<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> water<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
use to allow the water also into the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
use to allow the water also into the
soil<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.020> time<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.439> years<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
soil this time of years I will use a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.600 
soil this time of years I will use a
soil<00:01:35.939> wetting<00:01:36.570> agent<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> reducing

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
soil wetting agent and this is reducing

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.090 
soil wetting agent and this is reducing
this<00:01:39.030> reduces<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> fingering<00:01:40.200> effect<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this reduces the fingering effect that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.969 
this reduces the fingering effect that
allows<00:01:41.400> water<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.180> uniformly<00:01:42.990> enter<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> soil

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
allows water to uniformly enter the soil

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.179 
allows water to uniformly enter the soil
or<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.149> case<00:01:45.210> clay<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.799> many

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
or as in this case clay there are many

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
or as in this case clay there are many
different<00:01:47.670> types<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.210> soil<00:01:48.600> wetting<00:01:48.960> agents<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
different types of soil wetting agents a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.310 
different types of soil wetting agents a
golf<00:01:50.159> course<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.490> instance<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:51.509> use<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
golf course for instance will use a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.520 
golf course for instance will use a
different<00:01:53.100> soil<00:01:53.250> wetting<00:01:53.670> agent<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.659> the
