00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.730
 hello people today I will teach you how to download 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 the trilogy of crash games only them 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 I will teach how to download and install the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.790
 first since it is the one that I liked the most and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.740
 that it would not make sense to teach 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.350
 install the other two 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.300
 well let's start first that nothing like 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 we usually go to the link that gives them 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 I left in the description of the video they take 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.430
 the one that I like the most in my case 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430
 the first game 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.399
 they put it in the url to send them to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.149
 the half sphere page and that's where 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.149
 they will download it 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.969
 they click on the button quoted by color 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.969
 green where it says download 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.750
 and a window will automatically come out 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.310
 and you give him save file and he 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.310
 they will download the game 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.750
 wait for the download I will pass the video 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.750
 so they do not see the whole process 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.439
 but what a fool you are the first to 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.380
 not having file previously downloaded 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.360
 ha ha ha ha 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.360
 shut up fuck fucking 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.380
 good as you will see, I only need very little 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.900
 in downloading the file the file weighs 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.670
 less than 190 megabytes so do not 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.670
 ask for a lot let's go download 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.890
 already downloaded they go to the folder where 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.650
 usually your files are saved 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.989
 downloaded without knowing then simply 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.969
 click alternate and go to folder 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.510
 file and send them where they have it 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.510
 saved 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.290
 will notice that what was downloaded is a 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.240
 winrar file what happen in the writer and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.280
 if you already have it on the desk as in 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.430
 the case of many simply do not 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.430
 nothing 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.370
 the next step is the most common one is 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.230
 extract it give you alternate click or right 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.270
 and they click on extract here 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.610
 xstrata the installer automatically 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.800
 of the game is not for this you need the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.280
 winrar if you do not have it, download what 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.280
 It is easy 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.110
 the installer icon will appear 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.110
 click and start to install 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.550
 here a small window will appear just 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.550
 They give in following next install 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.350
 again it's a load time pause the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.250
 video so you do not see it this only takes 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.250
 less than two minutes 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.740
 already finished the installation they give in 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.480
 finish now the game will come out 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.280
 it will go slow for me since I have a 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.530
 computer shit ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.690
 ja no longer seriously going slow because I'm 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.580
 recording in qantas already study and then 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.580
 it will be difficult to record and start playing 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.100
 already if what they want is to accommodate the 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.620
 control to your liking as they give you in 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.840
 file later in configuration and in 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.850
 controls and there are you configure as 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 better if you want to look at how it is 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.720
 that I configured it in case you like it and 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.870
 if not then there you do to your 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.870
 taste 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.390
 good as I know what you want 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.550
 is play I finish the video I hope that they 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.440
 I liked it, it took me a little time 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.270
 make the video since I have many 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.400
 complications but I left 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.860
 vacation and now I only need the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.860
 ideas xd good I say goodbye take care
