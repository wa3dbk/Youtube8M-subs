00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello and welcome to this crowd 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.980
 is the recipe of the day is the dough to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.509
 pancakes for the kids or the friend toc toc 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.190
 came yes it's not Pac is not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 we need 300 g of flour 3 75 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.840
 centilitres from the east and 3 spoons 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.130
 oil soup 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 you put all this in a high salad bowl 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.189
 to place the flour we dig a well 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 and then we'll put the eggs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.840
 the oil and afterwards the milk 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 so that's getting pretty sporty from 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 I'll try to pass the baton 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 here is to die that is to say it is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 the phase where we need a man in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.770
 short exactly at the haven of aki I am 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 a few greedy no worries we pass 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410
 to the Chinese or just a little 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.820
 blow of the blender, we do not have any more 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 to wait a few hours and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 can accommodate it is not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 criteria but it does not matter at all 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 take something that everyone 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.449
 normally has in his closet a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 large stove 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
