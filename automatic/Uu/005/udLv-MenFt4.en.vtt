00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 this synchronizer is one of the most 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 used to synchronize the speed 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 of turning two gears before 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 connect 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.380
 three metal jackets with a shoulder 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.960
 they are placed in a cube housings 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.240
 they are pushed out with the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.880
 radial springs making the 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.550
 ridges fit into an internal recess 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.090
 of the collar keeping them centered 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.090
 each 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.010
 when the synchronizer is armed the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.440
 cube is kept fixed on the axis of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.160
 health and the collar can be displaced 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
 about him 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.700
 the friction ring made of bronze 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.220
 has three recesses that fit with the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.220
 jackets and conical surface 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 interior shoes with conical surface 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 of the gear 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.790
 It has fine grooves made in the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 internal surface and some teeth in the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.510
 periphery that fit with the teeth 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.510
 inner collar 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.240
 the recesses are wider than 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.410
 jackets so that the ring has a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.410
 radial displacement 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.770
 then the teeth can move with 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.770
 regarding the teeth of the collar 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 when the collar moves it pushes the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 key against the bending ring that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.450
 rub against the gear making it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.560
 the internal slots break the film 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.140
 of oil to cause friction 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.720
 the speed difference between both 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.550
 components causes the ring to rotate 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.470
 as far as jackets allow 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.810
 while teeth ring 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.300
 friction and the collar is in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.220
 misaligned the collar can not be 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.220
 move to achieve the connection 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.300
 the force exerted by the driver 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.209
 push the collar against the teeth 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.950
 of the bending ring increasing the friction 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.709
 against the gear until the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.680
 components begin to turn to it 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.080
 speed 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 [Music] 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.820
 now the teeth settle and the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.850
 collar can be displaced to achieve 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.660
 the definitive connection 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.210
 [Music] 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.820
 in this way gentle changes are achieved 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.730
 and fast without much effort from 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:11.689
 driver 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:11.689
