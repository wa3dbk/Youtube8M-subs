00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to do and in all honesty I really think

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.640 
to do and in all honesty I really think
we<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.060> catch<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.619> little

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
we can catch up to them with so little

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
we can catch up to them with so little
matches<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> play<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.960> goal<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
matches to play but the the goal is to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
matches to play but the the goal is to
get<00:00:22.769> into<00:00:23.160> Europa<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.420> quite<00:00:25.230> hopeful<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
get into Europa so quite hopeful about

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
get into Europa so quite hopeful about
this<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.180> our<00:00:27.330> first<00:00:27.840> match<00:00:28.050> against

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this so on to our first match against

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.669 
this so on to our first match against
Wigan<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:30.000> Danny<00:00:30.480> Murphy<00:00:30.750> wanted<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> play

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
Wigan and as Danny Murphy wanted to play

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
Wigan and as Danny Murphy wanted to play
I<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> thought<00:00:32.399> he's<00:00:32.700> only<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.360> just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I kind of thought he's only really just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780 
I kind of thought he's only really just
come<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.079> from<00:00:34.140> injury<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.860> playing<00:00:35.489> him<00:00:35.700> in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
come back from injury so playing him in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
come back from injury so playing him in
a<00:00:35.850> match<00:00:36.000> straight<00:00:36.270> aways<00:00:36.630> probably<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
a match straight aways probably not the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
a match straight aways probably not the
best<00:00:37.380> idea<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.610> instead<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> playing<00:00:39.149> Murphy

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
best idea so instead of playing Murphy

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.910 
best idea so instead of playing Murphy
I'm<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.840> play<00:00:40.079> group<00:00:40.469> granny<00:00:40.770> arrow

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'm gonna play group granny arrow

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
I'm gonna play group granny arrow
instead<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:42.300> he's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.140> better

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
instead because well he's a lot better

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
instead because well he's a lot better
in<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.040> well<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.850> match<00:00:45.090> started<00:00:45.300> off

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
in as well and this match started off

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
in as well and this match started off
really<00:00:46.079> dull<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> boring<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.969> only

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
really dull and boring and the only

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
really dull and boring and the only
chance<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> Aaron<00:00:49.590> Hughes

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
chance was really the Aaron Hughes

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.790 
chance was really the Aaron Hughes
header<00:00:50.039> fern<00:00:50.789> Dino<00:00:51.300> doesn't<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.350> come<00:00:52.649> too

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
header fern Dino doesn't really come too

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
header fern Dino doesn't really come too
close<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> finesse<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.180> good

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
close with the finesse a really good

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.470 
close with the finesse a really good
shot<00:00:54.750> though<00:00:54.930> Carly<00:00:55.620> nice<00:00:55.829> hand<00:00:56.489> Wigan<00:00:56.879> really

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
shot though Carly nice hand Wigan really

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
shot though Carly nice hand Wigan really
should<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.719> scored<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:59.010> paid

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
should have scored there and they paid

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
should have scored there and they paid
for<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.059> without<00:01:00.510> even<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
for that really without even just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
for that really without even just
snatching<00:01:01.530> off<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> fender<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
snatching off with the fender and just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
snatching off with the fender and just
sort<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> hitting<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> past<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> keeper<00:01:04.350> quite

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sort of hitting it past the keeper quite

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.460 
sort of hitting it past the keeper quite
casually<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.270> nice<00:01:06.960> finish<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
casually but it's a really nice finish I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050 
casually but it's a really nice finish I
like<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:07.890> strikers<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.610> cut<00:01:08.909> across

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
like it when strikers just cut across

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.870 
like it when strikers just cut across
the<00:01:09.570> keeper<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.100> power

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the keeper like that with so much power

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
the keeper like that with so much power
that<00:01:12.090> their<00:01:12.420> shots<00:01:12.659> can't<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.110> saved<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that their shots can't be saved and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
that their shots can't be saved and
Schwartz<00:01:14.880> makes<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.420> good<00:01:15.479> safe<00:01:16.049> there

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Schwartz makes a really good safe there

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
Schwartz makes a really good safe there
and<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> half<00:01:16.740> time<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.460> nil<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> Fulham

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and a half time it's one nil to Fulham

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
and a half time it's one nil to Fulham
I'm<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:19.080> come<00:01:19.439> through<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> bit

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I'm gonna come through this a bit

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
I'm gonna come through this a bit
quicker<00:01:20.280> than<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.670> anticipated<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.659> anyway<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
quicker than I anticipated but anyway so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
quicker than I anticipated but anyway so
i<00:01:22.680> starved<00:01:23.159> half<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.610> literally<00:01:24.000> blitzing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
i starved half just literally blitzing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240

target for once and fernandinho does
exactly<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.940> same<00:04:01.970> same<00:04:02.420> thing<00:04:02.690> it's<00:04:02.810> almost

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
exactly the same same thing it's almost

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.620 
exactly the same same thing it's almost
identical<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:04.100> guides<00:04:04.880> it<00:04:05.120> away<00:04:05.360> from<00:04:05.540> the

identical just guides it away from the
keeper<00:04:05.960> I<00:04:05.990> didn't<00:04:06.230> bother<00:04:06.350> with<00:04:06.710> a<00:04:06.740> replay<00:04:07.130> for

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
