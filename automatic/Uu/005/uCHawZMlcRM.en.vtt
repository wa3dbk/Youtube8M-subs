overgrow and this cancer as it develops

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.520 
overgrow and this cancer as it develops
will<00:00:32.669> create<00:00:33.000> areas<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> skin<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.200> look

through the body system it can travel to

through the body system it can travel to
other<00:00:47.309> organs<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> cause<00:00:48.719> organ<00:00:49.170> failure<00:00:49.230> as

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
looking for a size of it generally

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.919 
looking for a size of it generally
really<00:02:07.200> small<00:02:07.680> moles<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.849> necessarily

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
really small moles do not necessarily

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.280 
really small moles do not necessarily
to<00:02:10.370> cancer<00:02:11.370> however<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.420> there<00:02:12.659> are<00:02:12.750> over<00:02:13.019> six

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
to cancer however if there are over six

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.839 
to cancer however if there are over six
millimeters<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.010> size<00:02:14.040> there's<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.610> higher

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
millimeters in size there's a higher

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.369 
millimeters in size there's a higher
likelihood<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.540> those<00:02:15.840> cells<00:02:16.170> could

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
likelihood that those cells could

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.130 
likelihood that those cells could
potentially<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.069> cancerous<00:02:17.579> we<00:02:18.360> also<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.959> at

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
potentially be cancerous we also look at

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.679 
potentially be cancerous we also look at
the<00:02:19.319> general<00:02:19.739> color<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:21.030> actual<00:02:21.480> moment

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
the general color of the actual moment

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.479 
the general color of the actual moment
cell<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.629> uniformly<00:02:24.629> dark<00:02:25.189> that's<00:02:26.189> one

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
cell if it's uniformly dark that's one

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.009 
cell if it's uniformly dark that's one
thing<00:02:26.760> however<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.299> there<00:02:27.480> are<00:02:27.599> areas<00:02:27.989> in

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
thing however if there are areas in

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.630 
thing however if there are areas in
which<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.799> dark<00:02:29.069> some<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.459> its

which some of it's dark some of its
light<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.480> spotty<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.439> gives<00:02:31.890> us<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
light is kind of spotty that gives us a

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.589 
light is kind of spotty that gives us a
little<00:02:32.340> bit<00:02:32.459> more<00:02:32.670> suspicion<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.269> there's<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
little bit more suspicion that there's a

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.599 
little bit more suspicion that there's a
possibility<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.349> though<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.950> those<00:02:35.220> cells

possibility that though that those cells

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.539 
possibility that though that those cells
in<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:35.970> mole<00:02:36.239> or<00:02:36.390> cancerous<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:38.010> also<00:02:38.189> look

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
in that mole or cancerous we also look

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.660 
in that mole or cancerous we also look
at<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> general<00:02:39.120> border<00:02:39.569> surrounding<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
at the general border surrounding the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.240 
at the general border surrounding the
actual<00:02:42.030> mole<00:02:42.209> itself<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.069> nice

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
actual mole itself and if it's a nice

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670 
actual mole itself and if it's a nice
smooth<00:02:44.670> sorta<00:02:45.060> circular<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:45.780> oval<00:02:46.200> pattern

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
smooth sorta circular or oval pattern

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.890 
smooth sorta circular or oval pattern
then<00:02:47.459> we're<00:02:47.670> less<00:02:47.849> concerned<00:02:48.329> however<00:02:48.569> if

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
then we're less concerned however if

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.780 
then we're less concerned however if
that<00:02:48.930> pattern<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.590> sort<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.250> scalloped

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
that pattern is sort of scalloped

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.119 
that pattern is sort of scalloped
looking<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.540> has<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> lot<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> irregularity<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
looking or has a lot of irregularity to

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.069 
looking or has a lot of irregularity to
it<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.909> also<00:02:54.209> lends<00:02:54.450> us<00:02:54.659> to<00:02:54.780> believe<00:02:54.930> that

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
it that also lends us to believe that

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.629 
it that also lends us to believe that
there's<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.439> possibility<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.159> there<00:02:56.489> might

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
there's a possibility that there might

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.929 
there's a possibility that there might
be<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.680> than<00:02:58.829> just<00:02:59.010> simply<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.730> 9

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
be more going on than just simply of a 9

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.500 
be more going on than just simply of a 9
mole<00:03:00.239> we<00:03:01.019> also<00:03:01.139> look<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.129> symmetry<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
mole we also look at the symmetry of the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.589 
mole we also look at the symmetry of the
actual<00:03:03.900> lesion<00:03:04.230> itself<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:06.120> symmetry

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
actual lesion itself the symmetry

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.390 
actual lesion itself the symmetry
basically<00:03:07.139> it<00:03:07.439> means<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.769> if<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.189> were<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
basically it means that if you were to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.349 
basically it means that if you were to
divide<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.060> mole<00:03:09.389> in<00:03:09.720> half<00:03:10.609> each<00:03:11.609> side<00:03:12.030> should

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
divide the mole in half each side should

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.150 
divide the mole in half each side should
be<00:03:12.659> fairly<00:03:13.019> you've<00:03:13.260> almost<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.829> mirror

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
be fairly you've almost like a mirror

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.979 
be fairly you've almost like a mirror
image<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> mirror<00:03:15.180> image<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.629> each<00:03:15.780> other

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
image of a mirror image of each other

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.220 
image of a mirror image of each other
however<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.519> mole<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.970> sort<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.419> short<00:03:19.079> on

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
however if the mole is sort of short on

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
however if the mole is sort of short on
one<00:03:19.440> side<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.190> may<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.430> elongated<00:03:20.819> on<00:03:21.329> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
one side and may be elongated on the

one side and may be elongated on the
other<00:03:21.680> or<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.949> they<00:03:23.129> look<00:03:23.400> differently<00:03:24.030> if

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
other or just they look differently if

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.860 
other or just they look differently if
you<00:03:24.239> were<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.540> cut<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.349> half<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:26.519> that

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
you were to cut it in half then that

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.520 
you were to cut it in half then that
demonstrates<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.049> us<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.290> there's<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
demonstrates to us that there's a

these<00:03:59.940> moles<00:04:00.419> are<00:04:00.780> cancerous<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.379> they<00:04:01.799> need

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
these moles are cancerous and they need

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.520 
these moles are cancerous and they need
to<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.220> removed<00:04:02.549> immediately<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:04.109> further

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
to be removed immediately and further

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.110 
to be removed immediately and further
investigation<00:04:04.739> made<00:04:05.489> as<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.790> any<00:04:05.970> other

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
investigation made as to any other

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.899 
investigation made as to any other
potential<00:04:06.540> moles<00:04:06.930> or<00:04:07.109> even<00:04:07.409> if<00:04:08.129> there's<00:04:08.489> if

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
potential moles or even if there's if

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.330 
potential moles or even if there's if
the<00:04:09.299> if<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.109> mole<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.409> deep<00:04:10.650> enough<00:04:10.799> if<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the if the mole is deep enough if the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520 
the if the mole is deep enough if the
actual<00:04:11.669> tumor<00:04:12.000> has<00:04:12.299> gone<00:04:12.510> deep<00:04:12.720> enough

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
actual tumor has gone deep enough

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.110 
actual tumor has gone deep enough
you<00:04:13.770> have<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.069> investigate<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.790> lymph<00:04:15.030> system

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
you have to investigate the lymph system

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.720 
you have to investigate the lymph system
to<00:04:15.600> see<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:15.840> anything<00:04:16.260> has<00:04:16.410> spread<00:04:16.799> from<00:04:17.549> that

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
to see if anything has spread from that

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.060 
to see if anything has spread from that
point<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> skin<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.570> internal<00:04:19.079> organs<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
point the skin to the internal organs so

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.099 
point the skin to the internal organs so
sometimes<00:04:20.519> these<00:04:20.700> are<00:04:20.880> cancerous<00:04:21.389> but<00:04:21.840> then

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
sometimes these are cancerous but then

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.659 
sometimes these are cancerous but then
they<00:04:22.230> definitely<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.980> need<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.340> be

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
they definitely do need to be

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.270 
they definitely do need to be
investigating<00:04:24.360> if<00:04:24.419> there's<00:04:24.630> any<00:04:24.780> features<00:04:25.290> to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
investigating if there's any features to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.860 
investigating if there's any features to
the<00:04:26.430> mold<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.850> just<00:04:27.090> described<00:04:27.540> or<00:04:27.780> if

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
the mold and I just described or if

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.080 
the mold and I just described or if
there<00:04:28.020> has<00:04:28.169> been<00:04:28.200> any<00:04:28.500> change<00:04:28.919> now<00:04:29.639> how<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:29.910> we

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
there has been any change now how do we

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.150 
there has been any change now how do we
investigate<00:04:30.750> moles<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.440> see<00:04:31.650> if<00:04:31.770> there's<00:04:31.980> any

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
investigate moles to see if there's any

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.980 
investigate moles to see if there's any
cancer<00:04:32.850> in<00:04:32.880> well<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.450> very<00:04:33.720> simple

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
cancer in well it's a very simple

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.379 
cancer in well it's a very simple
procedure<00:04:34.230> called<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.860> skin<00:04:35.160> biopsy<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:36.180> what

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
procedure called a skin biopsy and what

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.330 
procedure called a skin biopsy and what
essentially<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:37.020> do<00:04:37.200> is<00:04:37.380> we<00:04:37.530> numb<00:04:37.770> up<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.040> skin

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
essentially we do is we numb up the skin

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.730 
essentially we do is we numb up the skin
and<00:04:38.550> we<00:04:39.000> take<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> little<00:04:39.510> punch<00:04:40.169> or<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> little

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
and we take a little punch or a little

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.280 
and we take a little punch or a little
bit<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.160> chorus<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.180> out<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.690> center<00:04:42.930> of

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
bit of a chorus and out of the center of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.250 
bit of a chorus and out of the center of
the<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.490> molder<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> lesion<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.990> then

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
the of the molder of the lesion and then

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.930 
the of the molder of the lesion and then
we<00:04:46.350> send<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.890> pathologist<00:04:47.460> who<00:04:47.730> will

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
we send that to a pathologist who will

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
we send that to a pathologist who will
basically<00:04:48.510> look<00:04:49.020> at<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.500> piece<00:04:49.800> underneath

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
basically look at that piece underneath

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.050 
basically look at that piece underneath
the<00:04:50.430> microscope

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
the microscope

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.060 
the microscope
and<00:04:51.240> we'll<00:04:51.840> look<00:04:51.960> at<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.260> cells<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.770> see<00:04:52.980> if

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
and we'll look at the cells to see if

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.700 
and we'll look at the cells to see if
there's<00:04:53.280> been<00:04:53.400> any<00:04:53.550> cancerous<00:04:54.210> change<00:04:54.710> or

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
there's been any cancerous change or

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.490 
there's been any cancerous change or
cancerous<00:04:56.250> features<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.150> cell<00:04:57.540> now<00:04:58.140> if

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
cancerous features to that cell now if

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.980 
cancerous features to that cell now if
cancer<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.040> found<00:04:59.220> then<00:04:59.940> that's<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.390> fairly

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
cancer is found then that's a fairly

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.450 
cancer is found then that's a fairly
serious<00:05:01.230> thing<00:05:01.680> it<00:05:01.830> has<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> be<00:05:02.250> addressed

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
serious thing it has to be addressed

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.180 
serious thing it has to be addressed
right<00:05:02.820> away<00:05:03.230> there<00:05:04.230> are<00:05:04.410> different<00:05:04.830> types<00:05:05.040> of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
right away there are different types of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.990 
right away there are different types of
melanoma<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.660> can<00:05:07.080> include<00:05:07.850> melanoma<00:05:08.850> that

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
melanoma that can include melanoma that

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
melanoma that can include melanoma that
goes<00:05:09.510> deep<00:05:09.890> some<00:05:10.890> melanomas<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.820> spreads

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
goes deep some melanomas that spreads

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.810 
goes deep some melanomas that spreads
less<00:05:12.720> deeply<00:05:13.139> but<00:05:13.470> more<00:05:13.710> around<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> sides<00:05:14.520> as

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
less deeply but more around the sides as

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.760 
less deeply but more around the sides as
I<00:05:15.300> said<00:05:15.510> before<00:05:15.630> there<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.050> some<00:05:16.290> cases<00:05:16.650> of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
I said before there is some cases of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.260 
I said before there is some cases of
melanoma<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.280> actually<00:05:17.729> don't<00:05:17.940> have<00:05:18.090> any

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
melanoma that actually don't have any

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.150 
melanoma that actually don't have any
pigment<00:05:18.600> in<00:05:18.870> them<00:05:19.020> they're<00:05:19.169> actually<00:05:19.620> what<00:05:20.100> we

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
pigment in them they're actually what we

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.580 
pigment in them they're actually what we
call<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.550> melon<00:05:20.880> onic<00:05:21.150> melanoma<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:21.960> there<00:05:22.380> are

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
call a melon onic melanoma and there are

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.260 
call a melon onic melanoma and there are
other<00:05:22.740> instances<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.490> melanoma<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.030> can

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
other instances of melanoma that can

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.630 
other instances of melanoma that can
occur<00:05:24.600> actually<00:05:25.050> not<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:25.890> where<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.340> skin

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
occur actually not just where the skin

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.730 
occur actually not just where the skin
is<00:05:26.790> but<00:05:27.000> also<00:05:27.150> in<00:05:27.419> the<00:05:27.570> skin<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.290> regions
