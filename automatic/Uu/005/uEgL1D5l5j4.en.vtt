I<00:00:33.550> don't<00:00:34.060> know<00:00:34.150> if<00:00:34.270> it's<00:00:34.390> because<00:00:34.630> the<00:00:35.110> glue

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
I don't know if it's because the glue

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.350 
I don't know if it's because the glue
dot<00:00:35.620> they<00:00:35.800> use<00:00:35.980> but<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.430> always<00:00:36.670> rips<00:00:37.090> open

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
dot they use but it always rips open

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.890 
dot they use but it always rips open
like<00:00:38.110> always<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.640> that's<00:00:39.850> that's<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.690> only

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
like always so that's that's the only

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900 
like always so that's that's the only
thing<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.170> don't<00:00:41.230> like<00:00:41.500> about<00:00:41.650> them<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.460> still

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
thing I don't like about them I still

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
prefer to have jewelry I guess but

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.870 
prefer to have jewelry I guess but
they're<00:00:45.820> really<00:00:46.060> fun<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.220> me<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.610> have<00:00:48.850> a

hardest<00:00:49.690> time<00:00:49.930> getting<00:00:49.960> them<00:00:50.380> out<00:00:50.470> like

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
hardest time getting them out like

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.040 
hardest time getting them out like
before<00:00:51.040> I<00:00:51.340> would<00:00:52.090> only<00:00:52.240> let<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.600> burn<00:00:52.720> like

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
before I would only let it burn like

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.530 
before I would only let it burn like
maybe<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.800> far<00:00:54.070> down<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.550> then<00:00:55.180> get<00:00:55.390> my

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
maybe this far down and then get my

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.530 
maybe this far down and then get my
packet<00:00:55.900> I<00:00:55.960> had<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.230> dig<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.530> out<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.940> time<00:00:57.970> I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
packet I had to dig it out this time I

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.050 
packet I had to dig it out this time I
let<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.050> burn<00:00:59.200> way<00:00:59.710> down<00:00:59.950> while<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.310> notice<00:01:00.790> that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
let it burn way down while I notice that

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.660 
let it burn way down while I notice that
the<00:01:01.330> packet<00:01:01.780> kind<00:01:02.530> of<00:01:02.620> shriveled<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.340> started

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
the packet kind of shriveled it started

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.640 
the packet kind of shriveled it started
to<00:01:03.790> shrivel<00:01:04.119> up<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.330> little<00:01:04.540> bit<00:01:04.720> from<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.439> heat

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
to shrivel up a little bit from the heat

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.190 
to shrivel up a little bit from the heat
so<00:01:06.220> in<00:01:06.670> my<00:01:06.820> last<00:01:06.970> video<00:01:07.299> I<00:01:07.330> was<00:01:07.420> like<00:01:07.509> oh<00:01:07.840> maybe

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
so in my last video I was like oh maybe

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.539 
so in my last video I was like oh maybe
we<00:01:08.439> should<00:01:08.619> wait<00:01:08.740> till<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.189> gets<00:01:09.249> down<00:01:09.520> here

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
we should wait till it gets down here

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.660 
we should wait till it gets down here
now<00:01:09.999> I<00:01:10.719> would<00:01:11.350> just<00:01:11.590> get<00:01:11.829> it<00:01:11.979> out<00:01:12.070> as<00:01:12.310> soon<00:01:12.579> as

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
now I would just get it out as soon as

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.209 
now I would just get it out as soon as
possible<00:01:13.179> I<00:01:13.359> honestly<00:01:14.049> think<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.829> glue

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219
