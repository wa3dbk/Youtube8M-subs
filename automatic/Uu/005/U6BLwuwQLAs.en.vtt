all<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.070> ready<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> test<00:00:11.940> fit<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
all right now I'm ready to test fit the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
all right now I'm ready to test fit the
ribs<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.110> top<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> spar<00:00:14.519> web<00:00:15.619> which<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
ribs on top of the spar web which you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.260 
ribs on top of the spar web which you
can<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.100> I've<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.550> roughly<00:00:18.330> placed<00:00:19.050> here

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
can see I've just roughly placed here

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.160 
can see I've just roughly placed here
let's<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.330> point<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.840> point

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
let's just point on this point

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
let's just point on this point
separately<00:00:22.619> these<00:00:23.779> also<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:25.650> great<00:00:26.039> because

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
separately these also are great because

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.070 
separately these also are great because
with<00:00:27.060> T<00:00:27.269> pins<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.869> something

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
with T pins you don't have something

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.339 
with T pins you don't have something
that's<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:30.080> roughly<00:00:31.080> hold

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that's going to just roughly hold

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.340 
that's going to just roughly hold
something<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.679> place<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.279> magnets<00:00:33.350> with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
something in place the magnets with

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.639 
something in place the magnets with
their<00:00:34.530> holding<00:00:34.890> strength<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.370> their<00:00:36.030> height

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
their holding strength and their height

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
their holding strength and their height
allow<00:00:37.649> me<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.129> adjust<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.899> place<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
allow me to adjust this or just place it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.090 
allow me to adjust this or just place it
in<00:00:40.649> roughly<00:00:41.930> whereas<00:00:42.930> normally<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in roughly whereas normally it's kind of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.410 
in roughly whereas normally it's kind of
like<00:00:44.219> having<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.520> third<00:00:44.730> hand<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like having a third hand which is a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040 
like having a third hand which is a
great<00:00:45.719> feature<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.410> Magnus<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:48.050> moving

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
great feature of Magnus as well moving

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.510 
great feature of Magnus as well moving
on<00:00:49.200> we're<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.980> ahead<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
on we're going to go ahead and like I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.459 
on we're going to go ahead and like I
was<00:00:50.700> saying<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.180> roughly<00:00:51.960> place<00:00:52.430> these<00:00:53.430> ribs

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
was saying put roughly place these ribs

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.510 
was saying put roughly place these ribs
over<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.750> spar<00:00:57.750> web<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> place<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
over the spar web and place it down and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
over the spar web and place it down and
slide<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
slide it in place and you can see that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
slide it in place and you can see that
it<00:01:02.870> slides<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.229> easily<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> go

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it slides really easily I'm going to go

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.600 
it slides really easily I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> finish<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
ahead and finish up with that but you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
ahead and finish up with that but you
can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:10.380> one

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
can see that they will each go over one

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
can see that they will each go over one
of<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:10.770> slots<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.420> when<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.540> come

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
of these slots right here when I come

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.030 
of these slots right here when I come
back<00:01:12.900> I'll<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.619> place

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.980 

all<00:01:18.040> right<00:01:18.190> I<00:01:18.220> place<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.820> ribs<00:01:19.120> as<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.840> can

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
all right I place the ribs as you can

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.680 
all right I place the ribs as you can
see<00:01:20.260> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:22.350> spar<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.060> bar<00:01:25.780> wet<00:01:26.490> now

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
see on the spar and on the bar wet now

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.610 
see on the spar and on the bar wet now
sometimes<00:01:28.690> what<00:01:28.900> you're<00:01:28.990> going<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.200> encounter

sometimes what you're going to encounter
with<00:01:30.160> placing<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.180> ribs<00:01:31.900> on<00:01:32.140> top<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.670> bar

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
with placing the ribs on top of this bar

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
with placing the ribs on top of this bar
or<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.510> worst<00:01:34.930> bar<00:01:35.170> web<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.530> this<00:01:35.650> case<00:01:35.860> as

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
or the worst bar web in this case as

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.650 
or the worst bar web in this case as
well<00:01:37.620> is<00:01:38.620> that<00:01:38.890> you're<00:01:39.010> going<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.190> have

well is that you're going to have
sometimes<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:41.140> not<00:01:41.590> flush<00:01:43.530> alignment<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.620> you

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
sometimes a not flush alignment that you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.330 
sometimes a not flush alignment that you
want<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.250> as<00:01:45.370> you<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.640> see<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:47.160> we<00:01:48.160> actually

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
want and as you can see here we actually

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.270 
want and as you can see here we actually
have<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:50.040> slot<00:01:51.040> here<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> little<00:01:52.030> high

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
have this slot here is a little high

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.469 
have this slot here is a little high
above<00:01:54.660> this<00:01:55.800> plane<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.130> what<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.060> need<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.210> do

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
above this plane and what you need to do

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.650 
above this plane and what you need to do
is<00:01:58.660> bring<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.900> down<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.240> there's<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.300> few<00:02:01.570> of

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
is bring that down so there's a few of

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.590 
is bring that down so there's a few of
them<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.810> are<00:02:02.580> are<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.640> little<00:02:03.910> high<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.180> one

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
them that are are a little high this one

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.260 
them that are are a little high this one
is<00:02:04.660> acceptable<00:02:05.110> that's<00:02:05.350> where<00:02:05.619> we<00:02:05.710> want<00:02:05.920> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270

this one's a little little high and on

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.120 
this one's a little little high and on
our<00:02:10.270> end<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.540> need<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> adjust<00:02:10.990> maybe<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.650> little

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
our end we need to adjust maybe a little

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
our end we need to adjust maybe a little
bit<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.340> well<00:02:12.900> always<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.290> sure<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.650> your

bit as well always make sure that your
your<00:02:16.150> surfaces<00:02:16.630> are<00:02:16.780> flush<00:02:17.110> if<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.010> any

your surfaces are flush if you have any

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.590 
your surfaces are flush if you have any
raised<00:02:18.340> point<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:18.940> what's<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.240> happen

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
raised point here what's gonna happen

raised point here what's gonna happen
when<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.840> place<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:21.250> instance<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.730> top<00:02:22.060> spar

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
when you place for instance a top spar

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.490 
when you place for instance a top spar
on<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:24.130> slot<00:02:25.110> you're<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.410> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
on here in that slot you're not going to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.759 
on here in that slot you're not going to
get<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.950> perfect<00:02:27.820> contacting<00:02:28.810> as<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.260> daylight

get a perfect contacting as you daylight

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.090

in<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.060> touching<00:02:32.100> high

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
in there because it's touching high

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.920 
in there because it's touching high
there's<00:02:33.760> two<00:02:34.090> high<00:02:34.300> points<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.810> it's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
there's two high points that it's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.150 
there's two high points that it's
touching<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.560> you're<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:35.769> going<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.950> get

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
touching on so you're not going to get

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.670 
touching on so you're not going to get
the<00:02:36.880> holding<00:02:37.570> strength<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.019> want<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the holding strength you want so you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.350 
the holding strength you want so you
need<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.950> make<00:02:39.100> sure<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.580> everything<00:02:40.239> is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
need to make sure that everything is

flush and to do that take out your ribs
and<00:02:43.620> maybe<00:02:44.620> sand<00:02:45.370> down<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.790> slot<00:02:46.060> or<00:02:46.660> sand<00:02:47.440> a

web<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.410> case<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.400> either<00:02:51.550> sand<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.420> far

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750

web or the rib itself in the slot to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.250

allow the rip to drop down a little bit

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.950 
allow the rip to drop down a little bit
so<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.590> two<00:02:59.739> surfaces<00:03:00.220> here<00:03:00.489> meet

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
so that the two surfaces here meet

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.610 
so that the two surfaces here meet
as<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.920> showed<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:04.420> surface<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.110> flush

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
as we showed that this surface is flush

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.340 
as we showed that this surface is flush
with<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.460> surface<00:03:06.850> right<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:07.900> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
with this surface right now it's not and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.280 
with this surface right now it's not and
that's<00:03:08.710> going<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.980> cause<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:10.150> glue<00:03:10.900> down<00:03:11.050> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
that's going to cause the glue down the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.410 
that's going to cause the glue down the
tops<00:03:11.560> bar<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:13.630> would<00:03:13.780> be<00:03:13.990> only<00:03:14.440> glued<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:16.090> top

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
tops bar it would be only glued on top

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.390 
tops bar it would be only glued on top
of<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.690> rib<00:03:16.960> instead<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.440> contacting<00:03:18.040> here

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
of this rib instead of contacting here

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.190 
of this rib instead of contacting here
as<00:03:18.460> well<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.910> don't<00:03:19.000> want<00:03:19.210> that<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:20.020> want

as well you don't want that you want

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.830 
as well you don't want that you want

everything to be lewd and touching to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.780 
everything to be lewd and touching to
create<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.320> strongest<00:03:23.680> joint<00:03:23.920> possible

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
well is when I just placed the tops bar

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.330 
well is when I just placed the tops bar
on<00:03:31.630> top<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.680> rib<00:03:32.860> where<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.100> going<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.280> be

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
on top of the rib where it's going to be

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.120 
on top of the rib where it's going to be
going<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.630> make<00:03:34.840> sure<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.800> surface

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
going and I make sure that this surface

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.070 
going and I make sure that this surface
here<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:38.050> going<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.350> be<00:03:38.470> flush<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:40.660> don't<00:03:40.900> want

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
here is going to be flush we don't want

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.780 
here is going to be flush we don't want
the<00:03:41.290> tops<00:03:41.620> bar<00:03:41.890> raised<00:03:42.250> above<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:45.430> plane

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the tops bar raised above the this plane

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.400 
the tops bar raised above the this plane
on<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> rib<00:03:46.390> as<00:03:46.600> well<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:47.050> want<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.350> be

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
on the rib as well we want it to be

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.830 
on the rib as well we want it to be
flush<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.250> maybe<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.760> might<00:03:48.940> need<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.360> in<00:03:49.750> this

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
flush so maybe you might need to in this

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.590 
flush so maybe you might need to in this
case<00:03:50.050> looks<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.100> need<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.340> sand<00:03:51.670> down<00:03:51.880> this

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
case looks like I need to sand down this

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.910 
case looks like I need to sand down this
slot<00:03:52.990> for<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.320> rib<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.270> like<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.870> use<00:03:57.270> basic

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
slot for the rib so I like to use basic

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.740 
slot for the rib so I like to use basic
popsicle<00:03:59.920> stick<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:00.940> glued<00:04:01.300> on<00:04:01.450> piece<00:04:01.720> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
popsicle stick and I glued on piece of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.830 
popsicle stick and I glued on piece of
sandpaper<00:04:02.110> as<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.360> plain

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
sandpaper as you can see just a plain

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.080 
sandpaper as you can see just a plain
old<00:04:04.930> popsicle<00:04:05.470> stick<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.250> what's<00:04:06.520> great<00:04:06.670> is

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
old popsicle stick but what's great is

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.480 
old popsicle stick but what's great is
that<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.390> perfectly<00:04:07.780> fits<00:04:08.020> this<00:04:08.440> slot<00:04:08.890> as<00:04:09.340> you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
that it perfectly fits this slot as you

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.400 
that it perfectly fits this slot as you
can<00:04:09.610> see<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.960> now<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.590> sand<00:04:11.920> down<00:04:13.410> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
can see and now I can sand down that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.770 
can see and now I can sand down that
slot<00:04:15.750> until<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.380> top<00:04:17.680> rib<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.340> top<00:04:19.030> spot<00:04:19.299> even

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
slot until the top rib a top spot even

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.670 
slot until the top rib a top spot even
fits<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:20.950> there<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.580> is<00:04:21.850> flush<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:23.440> top

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
fits in there and is flush with that top

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.990 
fits in there and is flush with that top
surface<00:04:23.890> which<00:04:25.110> now<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.410> can<00:04:26.710> see<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.880> is

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
surface which now I can see that it is

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.930 
surface which now I can see that it is
and<00:04:28.390> that's<00:04:28.990> what<00:04:29.140> I'm<00:04:29.230> looking<00:04:29.500> for<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:29.940> take

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
and that's what I'm looking for so take

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.190 
and that's what I'm looking for so take
the<00:04:31.060> time<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.870> fit<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.530> align<00:04:32.860> your<00:04:33.810> spars<00:04:34.810> or

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
the time to fit and align your spars or

any parts for that matter the more time

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.830 
any parts for that matter the more time
