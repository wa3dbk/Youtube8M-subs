I think that this flour does not absorb

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.390 
I think that this flour does not absorb
liquid<00:02:26.270> as<00:02:26.420> much<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:27.050> wheat<00:02:27.290> flour<00:02:27.530> does<00:02:27.830> so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
liquid as much as wheat flour does so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400 
liquid as much as wheat flour does so
you're<00:02:28.520> gonna<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.940> check<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.720> add<00:02:30.110> more
