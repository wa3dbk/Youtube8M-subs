00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.840
 hello guys I'm here with the galaxy s 4 and 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.040
 bringing a warm novelty to 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.450
 you 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.029
 the update of the new package 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.610
 left today is today morning at 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.940
 connect my device is comes already 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.610
 notification of a new update and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.800
 that update that went out in germany 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.470
 in some other countries it is now 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.550
 available to us here in Brazil that is 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:51.610
 that update that corrects aa 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.170
 Memory from 9.20 to 16 gigabytes is correct 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.460
 I will not partially show it now. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.820
 here's why 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.070
 for those who have not yet updated I 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.740
 I will demonstrate here the steps to 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.259
 reach her 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.470
 before you even upgrade 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.540
 because in my already I have updated more 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 those who have not yet done or who do not 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.030
 have not received the notification for the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.130
 can do the following 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.510
 process we will know that the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 settings 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:29.170
 then we'll go on over here at the end 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:37.330
 let's choose the option on the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:39.670
 software update device and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.070
 here we mark these two options in 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.650
 high auto update search 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.380
 updates automatically and 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.060
 only on wifi 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.590
 if you check this option it is only 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.850
 go tell him he will do the update 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.420
 but it will be eating from your package 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 of your carrier's data 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.930
 3g 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.190
 if you still want to do the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.890
 update via 3g 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.599
 Okay, just check this option but it's not 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.019
 recommended because it will consume the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.659
 band of your 3g package 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.879
 so let's update here 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.250
 at that moment he checks the 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.620
 server in mine here he will warn you 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.230
 the updates are already all ok 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.140
 as I have already done in the case of those who have not yet 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.750
 updated 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.750
 a message appeared for you to confirm 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.970
 whether or not you want to do the updates 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.590
 in case you put rock 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.400
 which gives you the message that have already been made 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.250
 the updates because as I said I 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.990
 I did this morning 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.120
 so this is it you can mark the two 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.820
 options and will update and make the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.980
 continuation of the operation 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.500
 very important detail, until a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.510
 it is a good idea to have the battery 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 fully charged or already do 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.290
 the update with it is connected or not 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.019
 computer or power to the network is 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.930
 important that the network is stable and that 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.580
 not suffer the drop did not cut 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 end with the internet not to occur 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.000
 no problem during installation and 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.980
 when they start to install do not turn off 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.790
 the appliance does not do any more 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.940
 operation let it complete 100% it 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.190
 will restart smooth the device leads 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 some time is about 20 minutes 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:47.690
 for the complete process to be performed and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.070
 the appliance is carried out on the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.880
 changes 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.590
 I'll show you here where you had the correction 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.660
 here in the application manager on the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.970
 I left one and it says here 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.810
 he was black now he has already changed to 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.970
 gray a way to access the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.780
 information that has been updated 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.600
 through widgets or holding 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.600
 here the home button is not 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.190
 holding on for a few seconds it will give 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:26.479
 here to our recent activities 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.419
 here in this first option in this 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:34.419
 first tool that is the manager 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.419
 and here in storage 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.449
 storage has been done now he 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.979
 show 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.979
 16 gigs for us 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:54.009
 the other change you had 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.710
 I do not have it so far by 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.559
 What I was doing in a short survey was that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.650
 came here for us in configurations in 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:05.860
 my device has now entered a new 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.089
 option that is the driving mode that you 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.710
 You can activate if you're driving 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:18.599
 a motor vehicle within that option 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.889
 he will have he has several other 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.129
 settings here that can be 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.289
 marked or not according to each 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.430
 user 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.129
 in case I'll leave this option here 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.069
 off 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:36.419
 if you turn it on, it releases the options 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.419
 show me a message here 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.889
 but as I will not use it at the moment 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.219
 I 'll leave it off 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.860
 this was one of the 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.569
 additions that have been made here in this 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.399
 new update 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:56.020
 please note that this update it 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:59.379
 has a little more than 320 megs 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.240
 the delay is about 15 minutes 20 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.159
 minutes to download the conclusion 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.589
 entire facility around 25 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.800
 minutes 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:11.139
 I say it was partially corrected 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.930
 the issue of memory because 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:22.060
 looking here one but storage 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:26.139
 we will note that here it has not yet been 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:31.120
 the total memory is corrected and it 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:35.259
 shows that as 9.23 this is here in 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:41.050
 truth is some failure to say a 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:44.050
 count down on in storage 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.110
 but I believe that soon in a next 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.560
 update is also fixed for 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.770
 that it really shows the 16 gigabytes of 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:58.550
 memory here 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:07:00.259
 It's promised with the device, that's it. 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.240
 staff was a very short video 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:06.770
 just to show you how to do it 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.680
 update process and quickly 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.819
 show what I already noticed is that it was 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:17.409
 added 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:20.090
 as I discover new ones 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.970
 updates that were made here in the 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:27.020
 our galaxy s 4g or is making a 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:29.590
 new video sharing with you until 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.590
 more personal
