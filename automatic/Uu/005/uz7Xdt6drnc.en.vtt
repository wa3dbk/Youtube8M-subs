the page don't just give them a print
button<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> every<00:01:39.270> page<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.869> once<00:01:40.710> you've

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
button on every page so once you've

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
button on every page so once you've
decided<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.400> page<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> be

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that you don't have to use the jQuery

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.389 
that you don't have to use the jQuery

function<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.530> I'm<00:03:50.650> going<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.829> click

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:51.009 
function so I'm going to click

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.280 
function so I'm going to click
JavaScript<00:03:52.000> function<00:03:52.389> so<00:03:52.509> so<00:03:52.689> far<00:03:52.870> all<00:03:53.109> I've
