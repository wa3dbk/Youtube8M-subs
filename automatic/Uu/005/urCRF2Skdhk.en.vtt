link below so the key to playing 7/8
with<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> fourth-floor<00:00:18.779> field<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> symmetry<00:00:20.039> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
with a fourth-floor field is symmetry so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.640 
with a fourth-floor field is symmetry so
what<00:00:21.300> I've<00:00:21.390> done<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.050> speed<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
what I've done here with this speed and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.880 
what I've done here with this speed and
exercise<00:00:23.130> 1<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.880> snare<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> bass<00:00:25.500> drum

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
exercise 1 the snare and the bass drum

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.540 
exercise 1 the snare and the bass drum
playing<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.970> 4<00:00:27.619> basically<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.740> play<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.010> 78

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
playing for 4 basically they play in 78

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
playing for 4 basically they play in 78
but<00:00:29.670> they're<00:00:29.849> split<00:00:30.300> evenly<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.380> gives

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
but they're split evenly which gives

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
but they're split evenly which gives
them<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> 4/4<00:00:32.430> feel<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> sounds

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
them a 4/4 feel this is what it sounds

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:45.310 
them a 4/4 feel this is what it sounds
like

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.680 

so<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.469> exercise<00:00:46.950> 2<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> keep<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so when exercise 2 we want to keep the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600 
so when exercise 2 we want to keep the
floor<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> feel<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.860> getting<00:00:50.250> into

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
floor for a feel but we're getting into

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.389 
floor for a feel but we're getting into
a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.390> 7<00:00:51.809> 8<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.739> let's<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:53.129> for

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
a little bit more of 7 8 so let's go for

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:14.300 
a little bit more of 7 8 so let's go for
it<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.330> exercise<00:01:12.780> 3<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:14.040> keeping

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it so for exercise 3 we're still keeping

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
it so for exercise 3 we're still keeping
with<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.640> 4<00:01:15.030> floor<00:01:15.299> feel<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.350> I've<00:01:16.470> added

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
with that 4 floor feel but I've added

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
with that 4 floor feel but I've added
another<00:01:17.009> bass<00:01:17.880> drum<00:01:18.210> pattern<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.810> snare

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
another bass drum pattern and snare

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
another bass drum pattern and snare
pattern<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.619> end<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:20.970> more

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
pattern at the end so it's a little more

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.050 
pattern at the end so it's a little more
syncopated<00:01:21.630> than<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> last<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.060> with

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
syncopated than the last one but with

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.260 
syncopated than the last one but with
that<00:01:24.299> snare<00:01:25.200> hit<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> end<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.130> 4<00:01:26.490> we're

that snare hit on the end of 4 we're
really<00:01:27.890> trying<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> keep<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.759> 4<00:01:30.090> feel

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

really trying to keep that for 4 feel
and<00:01:30.630> everything<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.310> symmetrical<00:01:32.310> as

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and everything as symmetrical as

00:01:32.400 --> 00:02:04.419 
and everything as symmetrical as
possible<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> sounds
