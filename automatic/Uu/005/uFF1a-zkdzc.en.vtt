he's on a stand which I ingeniously

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
he's on a stand which I ingeniously
designed<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.949> both

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
modes um this guy took a while to make

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.580 
modes um this guy took a while to make
actually<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> took<00:01:08.909> me<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.510> days<00:01:12.680> um

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.249 

okay<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.649> I'm<00:01:22.649> surprised<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.520> many

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
okay then I'm surprised at how many

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
okay then I'm surprised at how many
pieces<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.240> guy<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.369> mean<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.640> surprised

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that I actually found enough of the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.980 
that I actually found enough of the
right<00:01:32.729> colored<00:01:33.119> pieces<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.810> him<00:01:34.159> right

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
right colored pieces to make him right

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.310 
right colored pieces to make him right
um<00:01:38.630> he's<00:01:39.630> cool<00:01:39.869> he's<00:01:40.110> cool<00:01:41.479> let's<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.080> look

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
at him from the back not much to look at

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:55.760 
at him from the back not much to look at
but<00:01:45.990> still<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:47.429> of<00:01:47.520> important

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190 

okay

okay

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.130 
okay
to<00:01:58.770> transform<00:01:59.310> him<00:01:59.750> here's<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.960> bad<00:02:01.110> part

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to transform him here's the bad part

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.609 
to transform him here's the bad part
about<00:02:01.500> him<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.869> off<00:02:04.079> said<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
about him you have to take off said but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.789 
about him you have to take off said but
it's<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> bad<00:02:05.299> then<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.799> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it's not that bad then you take this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's not that bad then you take this
piece<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:11.690> plug<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.410> his

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
piece and you plug it in the back of his

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.860 
piece and you plug it in the back of his
head<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:17.160> take<00:02:17.519> slow<00:02:18.330> gray<00:02:18.569> peg

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
head like that you take slow gray peg

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.059 
head like that you take slow gray peg
that<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.290> holding<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.459> push<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> down

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
that was holding it on and push it down

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.259 
that was holding it on and push it down
and<00:02:23.569> then<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.830> get<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.430> pivot<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
and then when you get to pivot the

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.430 
and then when you get to pivot the
shoulder<00:02:27.720> blades<00:02:28.560> over<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.879> wings<00:02:30.090> will

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
shoulder blades over and the wings will

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.589 
shoulder blades over and the wings will
fall<00:02:31.440> down<00:02:32.180> then<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.590> rotate<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.910> arm<00:02:36.209> in

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
fall down then you rotate the arm in

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.130 
fall down then you rotate the arm in
like<00:02:37.079> that<00:02:41.239> now<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.299> get<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.750> turn<00:02:43.019> them

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
like that now you get to turn them

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140 
like that now you get to turn them
around<00:02:43.230> here's<00:02:44.190> how<00:02:44.400> he's<00:02:44.549> different<00:02:44.670> from

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
around here's how he's different from

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.990 
around here's how he's different from
all<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:46.110> figures<00:02:46.620> his<00:02:47.040> back<00:02:47.400> becomes<00:02:47.819> his

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
all other figures his back becomes his

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.039 
all other figures his back becomes his
front<00:02:48.739> sounds<00:02:49.739> kind<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.920> weird<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.280> yeah<00:02:52.130> okay

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
front sounds kind of weird but yeah okay

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.819 
front sounds kind of weird but yeah okay
to<00:02:55.049> assemble<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.650> ring<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.849> just<00:02:57.799> saw<00:02:58.799> a

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
to assemble the ring you just saw a

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.930 
to assemble the ring you just saw a
whole<00:02:59.130> bunch<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.489> hinges<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.360> stuff<00:03:01.940> it's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
whole bunch of hinges and stuff it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.970 
whole bunch of hinges and stuff it's
just<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.359> matter<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:06.260> getting<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.590> part<00:03:07.859> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
just a matter of getting one part to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.229 
just a matter of getting one part to
move<00:03:08.160> without<00:03:08.459> something<00:03:08.970> breaking<00:03:09.329> off

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
move without something breaking off

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:21.289 
move without something breaking off
which<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.450> okay<00:03:15.440> okay<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:19.609> I've<00:03:20.609> got<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.090> ring

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
which is okay okay so I've got the ring

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:32.970 
which is okay okay so I've got the ring
as<00:03:21.510> good<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:21.959> going<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.170> get<00:03:22.410> it

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.530 

and<00:03:35.040> what's<00:03:36.040> up<00:03:36.190> how<00:03:36.610> come<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.000> planet<00:03:37.390> has

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
and what's up how come the planet has

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.729 
and what's up how come the planet has
legs<00:03:38.069> well<00:03:39.069> let's<00:03:39.280> fix<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.900> flip<00:03:41.470> the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
legs well let's fix that you flip the
