00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
all right let's go over here look at
this<00:00:47.250> chassis<00:00:47.790> one<00:00:47.970> more<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.390> again<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this chassis one more time again the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.759 
this chassis one more time again the
chassis<00:00:49.949> is<00:00:49.979> completed<00:00:50.659> we<00:00:51.659> widen<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.530> sound

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
chassis is completed we widen the sound

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.119 
chassis is completed we widen the sound
a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.900> chassis<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.409> completed

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
a little bit the chassis is completed

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.570 
a little bit the chassis is completed
and<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.989> gone<00:00:58.259> through<00:00:58.619> everything<00:00:59.220> you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
and I have gone through everything you

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.079 
and I have gone through everything you
see<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.210> Orange<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:01.070> been<00:01:02.089> double

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
see here in Orange has been double

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.240 
see here in Orange has been double
checked<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> had<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.739> believe<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
checked and all I had to do believe it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
checked and all I had to do believe it
or<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.290> had<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> change<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.920> resistor<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
or not I had to change one resistor I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.819 
or not I had to change one resistor I
told<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> about<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.720> last<00:01:09.750> video<00:01:10.140> from

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
told you about in the last video from

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.520 
told you about in the last video from
6,000<00:01:11.790> back<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> 5,000<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.900> i<00:01:13.439> found<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
6,000 back to 5,000 and i found a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
6,000 back to 5,000 and i found a
capacitor<00:01:16.530> i<00:01:16.590> had<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> point<00:01:17.400> zero<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.700> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
capacitor i had put a point zero one in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.300 
capacitor i had put a point zero one in
but<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.899> that<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.500> blown<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> i<00:01:20.130> can

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
but now that i got it all blown up i can

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
but now that i got it all blown up i can
see<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> point<00:01:21.090> zero<00:01:21.329> five<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> i

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
see that it's a point zero five so i

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
see that it's a point zero five so i
changed<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> everything<00:01:24.240> else<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
changed it out to everything else is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.360 
changed it out to everything else is
good<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:25.110> checked<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.800> i<00:01:25.830> thought<00:01:26.100> i<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.670 
going to do I'm not going to put the
coils<00:01:50.400> on<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.610> RF<00:01:51.090> antenna<00:01:51.390> coils<00:01:51.869> until<00:01:52.440> last

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
coils on the RF antenna coils until last

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.060 
coils on the RF antenna coils until last
I<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.790> want<00:01:53.909> anything<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> happen<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> those

I don't want anything to happen to those
we're<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.250> put<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> if'<00:01:56.670> cans<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.330> and

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
we're going to put the if' cans in and

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.789 
we're going to put the if' cans in and
then<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:59.520> power<00:01:59.729> transformer<00:02:00.420> goes<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.799> then

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
then the power transformer goes on then

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
then the power transformer goes on then
the<00:02:01.920> if'<00:02:02.250> coils<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.330> we're<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> go

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the if' coils and then we're going to go

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
the if' coils and then we're going to go
ahead<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> put<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> front<00:02:04.590> face<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.400> know

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
ahead and put the front face on you know

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.479 
ahead and put the front face on you know
with<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> dial<00:02:06.450> scale<00:02:06.780> holder<00:02:07.170> reflector<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
with the dial scale holder reflector and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279 
with the dial scale holder reflector and
we'll<00:02:08.729> fix<00:02:08.939> the<00:02:09.119> dial<00:02:09.330> lights<00:02:09.659> up<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> get

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
we'll fix the dial lights up and get

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
we'll fix the dial lights up and get
those<00:02:10.439> where<00:02:10.799> they<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.400> light<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.760> hopefully

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
those where they they light up hopefully

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.220 
those where they they light up hopefully
and<00:02:12.689> if<00:02:13.530> everything<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.159> good<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:16.080> I'll<00:02:16.200> show

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and if everything is good then I'll show

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.979 
and if everything is good then I'll show
you<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.709> do<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.510> conversion<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:20.069> a

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
you how to do a conversion to a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
it now and you know we flipped them we

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
it now and you know we flipped them we
flipped<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.250> now<00:03:35.490> we<00:03:35.550> have<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.940> round<00:03:36.120> flip

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
flipped it up now we have to round flip

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.600 
flipped it up now we have to round flip
it<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:36.600> again<00:03:40.040> we're<00:03:41.040> back<00:03:41.220> under<00:03:41.520> the

chassis first we go to the top then we
you<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.100> started<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.550> bottom<00:03:44.670> then

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you know we started at the bottom then

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
you know we started at the bottom then
we<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.240> top<00:03:45.420> now<00:03:45.600> we're<00:03:45.720> back<00:03:45.840> at<00:03:45.959> the

just<00:04:12.690> going<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.020> go<00:04:13.080> over<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.470> I've<00:04:13.650> got<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> dot

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
just going to go over and I've got a dot

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.820 
just going to go over and I've got a dot
here<00:04:14.520> on<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.720> tube<00:04:15.900> sock<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.380> put<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.680> there

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
here on the tube sock and I put in there

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.640 
here on the tube sock and I put in there
with<00:04:16.980> some<00:04:17.690> liquid<00:04:18.690> white<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.380> know<00:04:19.470> that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
with some liquid white out you know that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.830 
with some liquid white out you know that
stuff<00:04:19.859> they<00:04:20.010> use<00:04:20.160> on<00:04:20.310> paper<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.330> white<00:04:21.600> stuff

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
stuff they use on paper the white stuff

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.840 
stuff they use on paper the white stuff
out<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.080> just<00:04:22.350> put<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> little<00:04:22.560> dot<00:04:22.830> between<00:04:23.040> 10-1

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
out I just put a little dot between 10-1

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.480 
out I just put a little dot between 10-1
and<00:04:24.060> pin<00:04:24.180> 7<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.980> would<00:04:26.130> be<00:04:26.160> pin<00:04:26.520> 1<00:04:26.850> pin<00:04:27.840> too

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
and pin 7 so this would be pin 1 pin too

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.710 
and pin 7 so this would be pin 1 pin too
there's<00:04:29.490> where<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.880> green<00:04:30.120> wire<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.660> to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
there's where the green wire is going to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.650 
there's where the green wire is going to
solder<00:04:30.990> right<00:04:31.350> there<00:04:31.800> ok<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.360> takes<00:04:33.510> care

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
solder right there ok so that takes care

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.020 
solder right there ok so that takes care
of<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> green<00:04:34.490> let's<00:04:35.490> see<00:04:35.640> where<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.850> white

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
of the green let's see where the white

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.590 
of the green let's see where the white
goes<00:04:36.770> now<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.830> white<00:04:38.160> comes<00:04:38.520> down<00:04:38.820> down<00:04:39.300> down

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
goes now the white comes down down down

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.230 
goes now the white comes down down down
they<00:04:39.870> connect<00:04:40.200> stop<00:04:40.440> between<00:04:40.650> are<00:04:41.190> for<00:04:41.640> right

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
they connect stop between are for right

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.110

that leaves us with the what lead is

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.430 
that leaves us with the what lead is
left<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:19.080> brown<00:05:19.770> yeah<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:21.060> old<00:05:21.210> brown<00:05:21.720> lead

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
left the brown yeah the old brown lead

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.910 
left the brown yeah the old brown lead
the<00:05:23.430> brown<00:05:23.670> lead<00:05:23.940> comes<00:05:24.270> out<00:05:24.510> comes<00:05:25.350> up<00:05:25.650> and

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
the brown lead comes out comes up and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.810 
the brown lead comes out comes up and
connects<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:27.140> between<00:05:28.140> our<00:05:28.710> five<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.520> a

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
connects to between our five and a

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.720

over and connects to this ground right

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.060 
over and connects to this ground right
here<00:05:53.670> solder<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.480> ground<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:55.350> right<00:05:55.710> there

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
here solder to the ground so right there

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.650 
here solder to the ground so right there
is<00:05:56.340> where<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.390> brown<00:05:58.080> wire<00:05:58.380> will<00:05:58.650> be<00:05:58.680> soldered

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
is where the brown wire will be soldered

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.600 
is where the brown wire will be soldered
and<00:06:00.660> that<00:06:00.810> was<00:06:00.990> easy<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:02.010> know<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.160> think<00:06:02.460> my

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
and that was easy you know I think my

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.510 
and that was easy you know I think my
poodle<00:06:03.090> Mac<00:06:03.360> could<00:06:03.810> have<00:06:03.930> done<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.400> so<00:06:05.400> let

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
poodle Mac could have done that so let

ahead<00:07:00.540> and<00:07:00.690> start<00:07:00.960> on<00:07:01.140> the<00:07:01.230> other<00:07:01.380> wires<00:07:01.650> these

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
ahead and start on the other wires these

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.610 
ahead and start on the other wires these
this<00:07:02.760> bunch<00:07:03.090> right<00:07:03.360> here<00:07:03.390> and<00:07:03.780> it's<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.260> same

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
this bunch right here and it's the same

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.180 
this bunch right here and it's the same
procedure<00:07:05.400> just<00:07:06.240> follow<00:07:06.660> the<00:07:06.990> wires<00:07:07.260> on<00:07:07.800> the

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
procedure just follow the wires on the

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.060 
procedure just follow the wires on the
schematic<00:07:08.930> then<00:07:09.930> come<00:07:10.110> over<00:07:10.320> here<00:07:10.470> wire<00:07:10.860> them

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
schematic then come over here wire them

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.440 
schematic then come over here wire them
up<00:07:11.480> nothing<00:07:12.480> to<00:07:12.780> it<00:07:13.430> both<00:07:14.430> iaf<00:07:14.820> cans<00:07:15.150> are

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
up nothing to it both iaf cans are

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.320 
up nothing to it both iaf cans are
totally<00:07:16.110> soldered<00:07:16.530> in<00:07:16.680> all<00:07:17.460> the<00:07:17.700> wires<00:07:17.910> are<00:07:18.090> as

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
totally soldered in all the wires are as

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.050 
totally soldered in all the wires are as
close<00:07:18.570> to<00:07:18.840> the<00:07:19.250> chassis<00:07:20.250> as<00:07:20.310> I<00:07:20.490> can<00:07:20.700> get<00:07:20.880> them

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
close to the chassis as I can get them

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.830 
close to the chassis as I can get them
start<00:07:21.810> your<00:07:21.960> little<00:07:22.080> crowded<00:07:22.470> in<00:07:22.680> there<00:07:22.860> now

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
start your little crowded in there now

start your little crowded in there now
and<00:07:24.840> I<00:07:25.200> think<00:07:25.260> what<00:07:25.590> I'm<00:07:25.680> gonna<00:07:25.770> do<00:07:25.890> is<00:07:25.920> go

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
and I think what I'm gonna do is go

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.400 
and I think what I'm gonna do is go
ahead<00:07:26.130> and<00:07:26.250> wrap<00:07:26.490> up<00:07:26.520> this<00:07:26.820> video<00:07:27.030> here<00:07:27.720> next

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760 
everything however we have yet to apply

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.210 
everything however we have yet to apply
voltage<00:07:45.030> to<00:07:45.480> it<00:07:45.630> so<00:07:46.440> what<00:07:46.590> we're<00:07:46.710> going<00:07:46.860> to<00:07:47.070> do

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.220 
voltage to it so what we're going to do

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.680 
voltage to it so what we're going to do
next<00:07:47.490> time<00:07:47.820> let<00:07:48.360> me<00:07:48.480> get<00:07:48.660> this<00:07:48.810> out<00:07:49.020> of<00:07:49.080> the<00:07:49.260> way

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.510 
next time let me get this out of the way
we'll<00:07:51.690> go<00:07:51.900> ahead<00:07:52.050> and<00:07:52.290> apply<00:07:52.530> voltage<00:07:52.980> years

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 
we'll go ahead and apply voltage years

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.910 
we'll go ahead and apply voltage years
of<00:07:53.700> the<00:07:53.790> you<00:07:53.880> know<00:07:53.940> the<00:07:54.120> primary<00:07:54.600> and<00:07:54.920> then

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:55.920 
of the you know the primary and then

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.070 
of the you know the primary and then
we'll<00:07:56.070> go<00:07:56.190> ahead<00:07:56.280> and<00:07:56.430> sample<00:07:57.300> some<00:07:57.330> voltages

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
we'll go ahead and sample some voltages

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.200 
we'll go ahead and sample some voltages
on<00:07:58.320> the<00:07:58.530> secondary<00:07:58.980> here<00:07:59.340> here<00:07:59.640> and<00:07:59.670> here<00:07:59.850> and

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.210 
on the secondary here here and here and

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.150 
on the secondary here here and here and
see<00:08:00.570> what<00:08:00.600> we<00:08:00.750> get<00:08:00.990> and<00:08:01.260> i'll<00:08:01.770> show<00:08:01.800> you<00:08:02.040> how

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 
see what we get and i'll show you how

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.090 
see what we get and i'll show you how
that's<00:08:02.400> done<00:08:02.610> how<00:08:03.000> to<00:08:03.060> check<00:08:03.420> out<00:08:03.630> a

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.100 
that's done how to check out a

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.650 
that's done how to check out a
transformer<00:08:05.100> on<00:08:05.220> the<00:08:05.370> bench<00:08:05.610> so<00:08:06.330> until<00:08:06.630> next

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 
transformer on the bench so until next

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.460 
transformer on the bench so until next
time<00:08:07.080> this<00:08:08.010> is<00:08:08.070> john
