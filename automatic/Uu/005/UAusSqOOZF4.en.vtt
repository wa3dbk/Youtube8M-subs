00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.220
 only he died 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.760
 rio friends here spoke of bringing north 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.410
 One more video for you guys, one more. 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.250
 episode of the range along with the subscribers 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.990
 on the map called formula carton allstars 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.460
 I played this map a little bit I liked it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 enough of the idea 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.450
 I really liked what they did. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 on this map and you will see it here today 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.830
 guys and all the guys are still coming in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.039
 but in the end I'll send those alves 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.140
 juice milk beauty so it's there to start 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.899
 let him though there begin to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.629
 and we have some cars here with 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.519
 thousand and we start with 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.069
 I do not know, so we do not have much money. 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.859
 so come on, we'll get the 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:49.170
 money on the tracks, for example, we only have 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.120
 100 here we do not have 300 but I go 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.879
 get that one out of 100 because we need to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 to economize you will understand why 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 until the end of this map 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 The goal is to get all the coins have 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 to get all the coins do not let 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 no country is because it is very 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.190
 It's important to have them all because 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.009
 friends you noticed our failure 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.070
 wrong I do not know if you've noticed but 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.130
 There's a little sign up there, right? 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.930
 the flag symbol then it must have 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 a winner here but to have that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.430
 winner he must have money to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.869
 pick up this flag, then it's good you 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 get all coins 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.780
 I think this is cool, the map is empty. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 I know why but it is empty. 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 unfortunately 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 So for you to play this game you have 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 to Make Wise Choices 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 for example when I first arrived 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.560
 Sometimes I 'm picking up the most expensive cars. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 500 and 300 type 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.649
 only I realized that I needed the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.539
 money to win 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.609
 I said no, I will not do it 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.649
 not when I start recording I'm going to pick up 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.310
 only cheaper cars than those of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.810
 100 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.969
 So let's see if we can do it. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.189
 to win that now if we can 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.590
 winning is going to be good but let's get all 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.659
 team coins is important and I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.060
 I find creativity very interesting 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.469
 this map here is a new thing 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.899
 The first time I see this, this 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.850
 type of race but it is an idea for 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.560
 Do you like running? 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
 If you do, I think it will be well. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.830
 cooler because it creates a goal is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.330
 Who 's playing here and I think 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 We will now have to win for us all 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 with a lot of coin for so 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 We move from one world to the next. 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.939
 We also need to pay need 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.530
 of 1,200 to move to a new world 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:34.200
 Now I 'm going to get this one, said the fish. 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.500
 of 100 again is not fault of 200 operated 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 200 there are about 200 that I do not 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.239
 I want to wait today without picking up all the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.370
 coins 3 thousand and 251 because so I think 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.310
 that the last portal is the most expensive then 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 we need two I think two of 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 2,800 to win the map and then 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.400
 we need a lot of currency leaves 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.510
 escape an ali but I think it does not have 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.939
 Problem I got here ok 3936 perfect 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.549
 he is in front of me not 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:17.189
 I did not have a good time but he passed away 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:22.200
 there is a chance it will be that he had a 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:24.480
 right money right but we go for more 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.120
 a round right because it was well short 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.790
 round then come on you already know that 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.099
 It has to be very fast picks up from 100 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.310
 She was the first one so lucky I left. 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.530
 here right the first time is almost hit the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.569
 If I had hit the car I would have 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.639
 lost money already, I paid 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.500
 in that car then try not to hit the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:51.419
 car of the galvanize a tip there for you and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.609
 ok win here're remembering is that all 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.299
 the possible coins because if not you 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.549
 will not be able to become the winner 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.370
 rock also remembering that if you do not 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.220
 Catch all and you arrive at the end everything 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.430
 and happens to money count there 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.590
 she goes as you are on the map 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.400
 so you do not need to get all of them 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.859
 even the maximum is only 90% of what 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.109
 Did you find in a group? 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:22.680
 I 'll get the 100% here. 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.199
 Then you have to get the most out of it and get married. 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.419
 You arrive at the end goes to type foul without 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.789
 You give it a little time there if you get lucky. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.430
 because it goes that another guy has the coin 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.830
 to buy, then risky 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.350
 make it wait 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.070
 but being that you will wait only to get all 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.500
 the coins make a mouth of good move and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.270
 ok let's see here 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.820
 Beauty I pick up from 100 of the coins 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.800
 I was taking the last car type knows the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.050
 of 500 so I came in the end I 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.300
 I said that it only had a thousand 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.980
 When I got to the end I said that I 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.610
 I'll buy these thousand but I got to 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.580
 anything 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.040
 That guy is going very fast, let's see. 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.570
 if he's going to have the money to win and I'm going 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.140
 follow him 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.510
 Okay, I'm with 3,600 but I think I'm going 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.880
 You get there first and there is there 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.990
 I think it came first and best. 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.180
 let's see if it will get the money 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.470
 aaa trying to win me like I could not 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.320
 take all the money I'll have to 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.630
 wait or else I'll have to go back 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.400
 only if I go back I basically already 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.160
 I will not win anymore, you know why I go. 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.320
 having to pay one thousand and four hundred again then 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.200
 It's not a good option to do this yourself. 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.210
 come back because I'm going to show you 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.590
 I'm going to step here 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.600
 I'll have to pay again then it was 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.910
 1,400 more than I found 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.370
 interesting because so you need 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.170
 reach the end with that amount 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.940
 So it's a calculation he made there. 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.590
 that works fine then left with the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.890
 car here a thousand is not 10,000 car and 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.580
 I thought it was a fucking good day. 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.470
 rich 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.970
 damn to think that if I caught him 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.010
 nor was he going to give anything away then a guy to 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.140
 be the winner the character at all 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.790
 points because if he did not pick it he would not 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.740
 Will you come back even though I'm not back? 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.620
 now cool 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.420
 and only ten coins already caught so 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.640
 I found this race very interesting. 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.730
 here very well done very well 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.660
 thought this new idea and congratulations to 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.860
