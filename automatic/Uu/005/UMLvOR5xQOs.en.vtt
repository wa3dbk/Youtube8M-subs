00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
before you leave the house I think you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
before you leave the house I think you
can<00:00:44.160> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> apply<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> kilts<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
can kind of apply that to kilts if you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.369 
can kind of apply that to kilts if you
think<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.800> hearten<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.120> pleats<00:00:48.450> but

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
think it's hearten you think pleats but

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
think it's hearten you think pleats but
a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.649> strap<00:00:49.860> buckles<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.579> if

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a little strap buckles you have here if

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.340 
a little strap buckles you have here if
you<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> those<00:00:51.510> three<00:00:51.719> elements<00:00:52.199> which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you think of those three elements which

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
you think of those three elements which
are<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> key<00:00:52.949> kilt<00:00:53.309> elements<00:00:53.850> maybe<00:00:54.390> go

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
are kind of key kilt elements maybe go

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
are kind of key kilt elements maybe go
for<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.530> skirt<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.160> two<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> those

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
for a skirt which has two of those

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
for a skirt which has two of those
elements<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.600> three<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.079> three

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
elements but not all three I think three

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.000 
elements but not all three I think three
is<00:00:58.859> overkill<00:00:59.460> over<00:01:00.059> kilt<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.199> I've<00:01:01.440> gone<00:01:01.710> with
