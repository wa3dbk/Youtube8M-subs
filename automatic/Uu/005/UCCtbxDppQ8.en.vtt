some red flags with me it sure does but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
some red flags with me it sure does but
it's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.159> premature<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.700> start<00:01:09.150> raising

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's a little premature to start raising

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's a little premature to start raising

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
due process claims because they're not

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
processing the applications fast enough

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
processing the applications fast enough
we<00:01:14.189> need<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> pru<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.960> decision

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we need to get the pru to this decision

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
we need to get the pru to this decision
finalized<00:01:17.250> first<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> hasn't<00:01:18.750> happened

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
finalized first and that hasn't happened

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
finalized first and that hasn't happened
yet<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.670> Orange<00:01:20.670> County<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.299> alone<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:22.700> San

try they'll be on the defense in if they
when<00:03:45.540> they<00:03:45.690> do<00:03:45.750> rather<00:03:46.170> than<00:03:46.320> being<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.769> the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
when they do rather than being on the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.470 
when they do rather than being on the
office<00:03:47.190> which<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.850> where<00:03:48.120> they're<00:03:48.239> used

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
office which is the where they're used

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.289 
office which is the where they're used
to<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.739> i<00:03:49.769> think<00:03:50.010> really<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.730> best<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.180> we

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
to so i think really the best that we

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.770 
to so i think really the best that we
can<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:52.530> we<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.769> take<00:03:52.950> away<00:03:53.190> from<00:03:53.220> these

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
can that we can take away from these

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.780 
can that we can take away from these
these<00:03:54.780> backlogged<00:03:55.709> applications<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.610> that

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
these backlogged applications is that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.520 
these backlogged applications is that
there's<00:03:57.150> always<00:03:57.570> been<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.989> tremendous

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
there's always been this tremendous

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.310 
there's always been this tremendous
interest<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.250> now<00:03:59.970> we've<00:04:00.330> kind<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.630> woken<00:04:01.080> a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
interest and now we've kind of woken a

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.160 
interest and now we've kind of woken a
sleeping<00:04:01.830> tiger<00:04:02.370> even<00:04:03.120> though<00:04:03.269> after<00:04:03.989> last

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
sleeping tiger even though after last

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.229 
sleeping tiger even though after last
year's<00:04:04.440> legislative<00:04:04.650> session<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.610> lot<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
year's legislative session a lot of

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.789 
year's legislative session a lot of
people<00:04:06.390> are<00:04:06.630> already<00:04:06.780> paying<00:04:07.080> attention<00:04:07.650> but

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
people are already paying attention but

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.640 
people are already paying attention but
but<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.580> think<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.320> politicians<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
but now I think the politicians and the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.289 
but now I think the politicians and the
sheriff's<00:04:11.250> are<00:04:11.370> really<00:04:11.610> seeing<00:04:11.880> how<00:04:12.120> much

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
sheriff's are really seeing how much

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.670 
sheriff's are really seeing how much
interest<00:04:12.570> there<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.959> on<00:04:13.110> these<00:04:13.200> things<00:04:13.410> and

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
interest there is on these things and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.229 
interest there is on these things and
I'm<00:04:14.010> not<00:04:14.220> sure<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.579> could<00:04:14.700> ever<00:04:14.880> put<00:04:15.090> this

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
I'm not sure you could ever put this

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.130 
I'm not sure you could ever put this
genie<00:04:15.510> back<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.019> bottle<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:18.660> Bell<00:04:18.900> has

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
genie back in the bottle this Bell has

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.949 
genie back in the bottle this Bell has
been<00:04:19.350> rung<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.299> people<00:04:21.299> are<00:04:21.450> seeing<00:04:21.720> that

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
been rung and people are seeing that

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.350 
been rung and people are seeing that
this<00:04:22.169> freedom<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.740> within<00:04:23.460> their<00:04:23.789> grasp<00:04:24.000> and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
this freedom is within their grasp and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.000 
this freedom is within their grasp and
they're<00:04:24.479> not<00:04:24.630> about<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.960> back<00:04:25.320> off<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.770> let<00:04:25.890> it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
they're not about to back off and let it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.800 
they're not about to back off and let it
get<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.490> slip<00:04:26.729> away<00:04:26.880> again<00:04:27.000> so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
get the slip away again so

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.930 
get the slip away again so
I<00:04:27.900> don't<00:04:28.260> know<00:04:28.440> what's<00:04:29.190> going<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.460> happen<00:04:29.520> if

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
I don't know what's going to happen if

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.700 
I don't know what's going to happen if
the<00:04:30.060> purdah<00:04:30.360> decision<00:04:30.810> becomes<00:04:31.110> final<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.680> I

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
the purdah decision becomes final but I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.840 
the purdah decision becomes final but I
think<00:04:31.980> there's<00:04:32.160> going<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> be<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.550> lot<00:04:32.730> of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
think there's going to be a lot of

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.730 
think there's going to be a lot of
people<00:04:33.000> voting<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.350> lot<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.590> people

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
people voting and a lot of people

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.100 
people voting and a lot of people
putting<00:04:35.070> pressure<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.760> sheriff's<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:37.080> uh

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
putting pressure on the sheriff's to uh

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.060 
putting pressure on the sheriff's to uh
uh<00:04:37.700> issue<00:04:38.700> these<00:04:38.970> regardless<00:04:39.860> yeah<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.889> think

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
uh issue these regardless yeah I think

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.960 
uh issue these regardless yeah I think
you're<00:04:41.310> right<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.410> know<00:04:43.500> again<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.820> is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
you're right and you know again this is

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.000 
you're right and you know again this is
very<00:04:45.150> important<00:04:45.600> because<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:46.020> California<00:04:46.770> all

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
very important because in California all

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.270 
very important because in California all
virtually<00:04:47.639> all<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.419> media<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.980> people

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
virtually all of the media that people

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.310 
virtually all of the media that people
are<00:04:50.430> reading<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.880> reacting<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.480> are

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
are reading and reacting to are

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.960 
are reading and reacting to are
presenting<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:52.950> argument<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.610> that

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
presenting this argument that that

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.210 
presenting this argument that that
people<00:04:54.360> don't<00:04:54.510> really<00:04:54.780> want<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.110> right<00:04:55.380> it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
people don't really want this right it's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.460 
people don't really want this right it's
wrong<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.580> think<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.180> people<00:04:57.300> have<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:58.169> right

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
wrong to think that people have a right

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.580 
wrong to think that people have a right
of<00:04:58.950> self-defense<00:04:59.669> and<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.900> again<00:05:01.260> what<00:05:01.440> we're

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
of self-defense and and again what we're

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.040 
of self-defense and and again what we're
seeing<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.280> ground<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.300> repudiation

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
seeing on the ground is that repudiation

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.780 
seeing on the ground is that repudiation
of<00:05:05.389> this<00:05:06.389> ideology<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.530> now<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.490> don't

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
of this ideology that now you don't

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.680 
of this ideology that now you don't
really<00:05:08.880> have<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.090> right<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.389> protect
