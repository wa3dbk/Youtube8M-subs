 resulting in 1112 deaths 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 this event to this day is considered 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 the biggest tragedy in history 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.440
 mankind related to sports 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.300

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.600
 it is in french though in fact it 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.700
 in German when leaving memories 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.650
 during a conversation with sean and rebecca 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.450
 the latter says that language packs 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
 Animus not really configured 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.690
 because of what arise like 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:19.590
 misunderstandings on the forks program 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:21.750
 translator face there is no stigma of assassins on

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.060
 in the second part of the game the next secret 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 an event in the present takes place in 2012 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.050

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.760
