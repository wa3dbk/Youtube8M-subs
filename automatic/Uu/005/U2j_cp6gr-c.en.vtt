00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
Joker figure for a while it just didn't

that figure it comes with two different

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
that figure it comes with two different
versions<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> irregular<00:00:33.480> looking

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
versions one is the irregular looking

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.670 
versions one is the irregular looking
anakin<00:00:34.559> head<00:00:35.059> like<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.260> second

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
anakin head like this one and the second

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
anakin head like this one and the second
one<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.850> darker<00:00:39.149> looking

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
one is actually a more darker looking

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
one is actually a more darker looking
like<00:00:40.440> he's<00:00:40.620> part<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> Darkseid<00:00:41.850> version

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.360 
like he's part of the Darkseid version
this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> original<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.800> I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this is not the original one I'm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
this is not the original one I'm
actually<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.930> original<00:00:46.230> one

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actually using it to the original one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200 
actually using it to the original one
I'm<00:00:46.620> using<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> naked<00:00:47.190> than<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> head<00:00:47.520> cast<00:00:47.850> but

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
I'm using the naked than a head cast but

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'm using the naked than a head cast but
uh<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.960> guys<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> idea<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.550> bit

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
uh you guys get the idea a little bit

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.680 
uh you guys get the idea a little bit
from<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.180> hopefully<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
from this one hopefully you can see it

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
from this one hopefully you can see it
but<00:00:54.690> anyway<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.170> used<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> Darkseid

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but anyway so I used the Darkseid

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420 
but anyway so I used the Darkseid
version<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> head<00:00:57.480> cast<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.739> Joker

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
version to make the head cast for Joker

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
version to make the head cast for Joker
basically<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.750> when<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.079> making<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
basically and when I was making this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
basically and when I was making this
like<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.890> said<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> wanted<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
like I said I wanted to be more

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
like I said I wanted to be more
realistic<00:01:03.000> looking<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> line<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
realistic looking more of the line of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
realistic looking more of the line of
the<00:01:05.729> Dark<00:01:06.210> Knight<00:01:06.420> Heath<00:01:06.810> Ledger<00:01:07.170> version<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the Dark Knight Heath Ledger version and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.920 
the Dark Knight Heath Ledger version and
I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.939> came<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I think it came out pretty well so the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
I think it came out pretty well so the
way<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.080> did<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.710> had<00:01:11.070> casted<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> anakin

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
way I did was I had casted the anakin

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
way I did was I had casted the anakin
head<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.140> painted<00:01:13.799> him<00:01:13.920> normal<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> flesh

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
head I painted him normal like a flesh

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.609 
head I painted him normal like a flesh
face<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.930> brown<00:01:16.259> hair<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.759> after<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
face of brown hair and then after that I

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.370 
face of brown hair and then after that I
went<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.299> makeup<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.570> make<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.960> white

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
went with the makeup to make it white

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.530 
went with the makeup to make it white
and<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.580> different<00:01:23.970> shades<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and also I did two different shades of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
and also I did two different shades of
green<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.380> top<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> brown<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.970> so
