00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.580
 to process a small plate into a sleek shape you have next to your small plate 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.839
 some other things needed 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.839
 and do not mind to get rid of the excess clay 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.019
 pee a spatula 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.019
 allow more manure to finish reading things 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.310
 it is a tight cut 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 to connect things 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.760
 smit that small on the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240
 that must connect to each other 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.720
 do this on both the dea 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.520
 I look like daddy demands namely to each other and so you make a good firm 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 reduction 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.510
 eric client picture on state does not give it as normal to stick this can 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 you at the end 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 with a very thin little roll with the proceedings 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 from stee question 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.549
 with a spatula you press a small roll between both places 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 by this carefully because this ensures a good connection 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 the indirect used excess clay road 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.920
 if you have a lot of pictures that are zn make sure that you also have the sides well 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:26.979
 anoint 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.979
 for the rest you have to work exactly the same at its end 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 so you have the clay picture 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.859
 and then again use a small circle to strengthen me 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.589
 by this time also in the corner 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.369
 continue until you get the formula that you picture 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.049
 pure white placement 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.089
 and of course the other places 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.189
 and place on top of each other at the delepiere 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.709
 spend that connection again with a small roll and I finish nicely 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.609
 You can indeed scrape off pieces in the shape and pier image 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.810
 it is along the plate and it can protrude wherever it protrudes 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 with a welder you make sure that more people become real 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.420
 the lax on the inside and of course with your fingers against my class a 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.999
 now we are going to tidy the outer ones 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.400
 so the connection is greatly increased 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 with a spatula Miffy the club in Ningbo 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.139
 by this 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 after that you may not be placed then I stand to spare 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.710
 it can still get a bit messy 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.710
 therefore use a putty knife at the end 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.879
 plans with that it is ironing you completely had it 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.639
 you can put your fingers against the inside hard line that does this 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.229
 but it is even better to put the welding on the inside as the shape shows 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.419
 nicer 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.139
 the frame on the inside a small wall man shines over the small ring 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.389
 the top all the pieces 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.389
 and then you are done with your rights 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.529
 nice xtrac box 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:23.979
 good luck 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.479
 do not greet post-processing always tidy up your things
