00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:13.299
 Is a camera on the Yes Hello Gateresa it is today 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:18.400
 Have them learn the basic concepts that you must make sure to lose weight 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:21.890
 At the end of this story you have to know what you must know in order to lose weight. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.730
 Please listen as much as possible until the last to tell 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.480
 If you don't know that you know this, you can see the goal or not 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.800
 I think there was a difference, so I listened to the end 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.930
 It is move the lose weight so-called body if you ne Teru Kimu First 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 So you lose weight if move made it is that is is this I think that people often think are in the wild 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 It is not 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 Of course it would be nice if you could muscle-treat muscle training 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 It is true that it will be easier to do, but what is important is it? 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.350
 I think that you put on the king and take nourishment well 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.660
 It does not attach to say that muscle 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.860
 7 For example, if you have a muscle ache, you have not taken protein etc. 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.520
 Of course the muscles recover but the muscles don't get too strong 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.890
 For example , if you compare to the key, the wind blew and the tree fell 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.580
 If you still feel that way, the tree will fall down when the same wind blows there 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.340
 is not it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.289
 Once muscle 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 When the so-called tree from which the head is raised falls firmly next time 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:30.340
 Firmly harden the agent to prevent it from falling when stronger wind blows 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 The process is a process of taking nutrition well. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.329
 Nice muscle pain movement and fly to the so firmly muscle training 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.240
 It doesn't make sense if you don't take it well, but in that case too 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:47.170
 Take a firmly , you have to rest muscles 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.380
 I have to make time to solidify the so-called foundation 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 The material does not stick well I move firmly 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.650
 If the muscles are different, take nourishment firmly 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 For the first time get the muscles it is resting so-called muscle training 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.740
 It will be that the metabolism is going up 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.550
 The gas could even be asked to do before the road at all it is if such a case that is not happening of shoes confidential to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.270
 is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.400
 It is good when there are shoes in the seat 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.780
 And perhaps training is not firmly take the total is a little painful it cheaper body think can 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.960
 It will be the timing 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.230
 Next I will go into a meal I think that I can lose weight if I exercise I have half 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.260
 The other half is a hamburger mistake 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.860
 That will reduce the fat that does not put a I only fat can 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.980
 I have to think about that is the cause 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.350
 There is something called trans fatty acid 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.630
 Arms etc. that went mad around 2005 to 6 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.080
 It was said that plastic etc. to eat 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.910
 It is many Kedomo I think that the longer you everyone forget 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.430
 In the process of processing vegetable oil 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 We will harden by the addition of hydrogen It is I Iwatsubute unit is in vegetable oil 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 In such cases, you can do margarine or shortening 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.170
 And there are a lot of words that there is no pad 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.230
 There is a thing called trans fatty acid which is contained in a lot of strange 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.489
 It is first, when you try It is a detail 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:20.950
 It is said that if it is not a grass that has changed before the oil moth, it is a 2 tic product 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:26.290
 You won't be tempted with plastic, for example, a plastic bottle that has fallen to the sea 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 I think you slept better forever at the bottom because such a PET bottle is a not dissolve naturally 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.220
 It 's happening in our bodies 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:39.810
 It is When the grain is Nakata is included that such it is to say that it is not broken down milling is 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:44.670
 It is a plant cool child as a fat spread in the margarine and Kaso 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.599
 Speaking of food that contains these ingredients, I have a diet 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.709
 Please do not eat if you do not eat it like the ingredient list 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.980
 Well there are a lot of things after all bread or chocolate candy 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.800
 It is included in a lot even though it is daring 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.370
 You look at the ingredients, but you can not exercise just by refraining 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.410
 It is 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270
 helpful 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.390
 Will be 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:12.100
 Because fatty acids are said to be why plastics 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.280
 Insects of Zaku not it and the natural world also is that it does not recognize the food 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.959
 Also I'd left a photo of 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.030
 One it is depending on the two bend is Badr 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.930
 ARinko selfish you are depending on where it has been due to the other before the butter 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.910
 It is to say whether it is does not contain There is also one animal does it mean to margarine 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.750
 It means that ignorance is not considered as food even before this last time 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:39.940
 But people would still have to 9 o'clock to say Toka these margarine 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:44.110
 Less likely to be broken down into it it went so the body is still etc. What people are firmly taking the Hula 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:49.400
 It is I think the following is to have entered a member of the direction which body weight is increasing 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:53.660
 I think you would be rotten to participate It is why watermelon course water car 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:59.780
 If passed 80 days will be so rotten and if you go to this below 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.440
 It has passed plus 100 days after 180 days than this is it c Date McDonald 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.920
 Ne 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.950
 It is not rotten at all 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.480
 That means it is firmly in the body 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:14.170
 It becomes a situation where it is difficult to be deconstructed as it is accumulated as aspirations 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:18.430
 Not Ika decreases fat even when the not Ika ahead of these things in the convex 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:22.570
 If it moves, it will feel like it will not decrease even if you think it will decrease. 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:26.060
 But it is Iun me what is included a lot in that said if I end is to 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.230
 It looks like this 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.110
 Deep-fried fast food donut suede cup cup ramen retort food 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.060
 Someone who wants to lose weight 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.510
 This afternoon item there is an afternoon item, but maybe two or three maybe maybe 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:45.760
 And then I think women probably won't quit 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:51.010
 We think that there are many women who can eat confectionery cookies chocolate morning chocolate cake confectionery bread 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.100
 These things are included so much in the end It is the end after that 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.880
 And riding on 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.200
 Number of whipped creams 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:04.169
 It is attractive to coffee and many of these are included 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:10.229
 Half of these are 40 to 50% dead 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:13.280
 Will you feel it 's there for himself to the half body out to eat once it is that 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:16.150
 Keep these foods tight 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.480
 I have to keep my muscles tight 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:25.210
 It is because you can not burn 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.540
 First of all look at the ingredient list from today If you can choose something good and bad to eat well 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.370
 I think 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:35.900
 And I see this, so I think some people wondered what to do 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.880
 Those who bought the ingredients first are themselves 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.620
 Seasoned and eat 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:45.270
 Just get them to do some fatbread or bend outside 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.200
 Because it will be ingredients that you do not use 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.230
 I also make them eat and eat well 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.700
 If you do so, you will always lose weight 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:07:01.860
 Want out muscle tension or movement I muscle pain is and muscle training 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:06.120
 I think it's easy to feel for myself, but it is like changing the choice of food restrictions 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:10.350
 It looks But can not I in the day eyes while those saying so 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.220
 Make sure to reduce the amount of ingredients included here. 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.330
 It is all right to lose body fat 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.240
 I will continue to work, so I can see that the goal is visible 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.820
 Because 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.320
 Let's do our best without giving up 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.320
 Thank you for watching today
