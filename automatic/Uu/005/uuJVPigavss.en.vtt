00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.710
 hello today we are going to make a 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.599
 demonstration of metal engraving in the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.810
 If we are going to make a recording in 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.340
 tools for shooting metals or 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.619
 hard materials 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.500
 we must use the carbide tips of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.949
 tungsten for our recording let's 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.199
 use the tip 99 11 to customize the 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.500
 tool with the initial letters of my 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.500
 name 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.990
 are infinite the possibilities that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.750
 we have with this type of recording are the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 initials of the name a drawing or the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.440
 part numbering 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 reminding you that the depth of your 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 drawing varies according to the quantity 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.900
 of times when we passed the tip by the same 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 line that is more possibilities to grÃªmio 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.730
 I have the kit for recording and sculpting. 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 on it we have high speed tips 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.160
 for woods and soft materials tips 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.400
 from tungsten carbide to 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.370
 recordings of metals or hard materials and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.270
 the diamond tips for engraving on 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.210
 glasses and precious parts and remember to have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.070
 things that only a guild tool does 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.070
 more practical and accurate
