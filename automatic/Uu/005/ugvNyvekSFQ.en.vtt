through<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.200> those<00:01:50.289> sorts<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.649> statistic<00:01:51.189> so

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
through all those sorts of statistic so

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.279 
through all those sorts of statistic so
look<00:01:51.759> what<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:51.969> want<00:01:52.240> from<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.569> a<00:01:52.780> passion<00:01:53.229> I

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.559 
look what I want from you is a passion I
mean<00:01:53.439> what<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.950> enjoyment<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.999> flying<00:01:55.420> a

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
mean what is the enjoyment of flying a

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.590 
mean what is the enjoyment of flying a
sport<00:01:55.840> cruiser<00:01:56.020> once<00:01:56.889> you<00:01:57.130> try<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:58.299> fly<00:01:58.539> this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
sport cruiser once you try to fly this

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.599 
sport cruiser once you try to fly this
aircraft<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.319> mean<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.920> there<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.249> very

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
aircraft I mean that there is a very

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.419 
aircraft I mean that there is a very
hard<00:02:01.509> way<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.899> get<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.679> fly<00:02:02.889> another<00:02:03.159> aircraft

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
hard way to get to fly another aircraft

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.300 
hard way to get to fly another aircraft
because<00:02:03.939> there<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.659> no<00:02:05.170> comparison<00:02:05.619> basically

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
because there is no comparison basically

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.029 
because there is no comparison basically
this<00:02:07.140> aircraft<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.229> really<00:02:08.560> setting<00:02:08.740> this

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
this aircraft is really setting this

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.730 
this aircraft is really setting this
industry<00:02:09.550> standards<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:11.080> think<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.530> got

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
industry standards and I think it's got

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.770 
industry standards and I think it's got
great<00:02:12.250> future<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.820> it's<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> reason<00:02:13.150> why<00:02:13.540> we

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
great future and it's the reason why we

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.560 
great future and it's the reason why we

fantastic<00:02:20.140> product<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.129> things<00:02:21.220> that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
fantastic product one of the things that

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.680 
fantastic product one of the things that
we<00:02:21.550> were<00:02:21.670> saying<00:02:21.819> just<00:02:22.000> before<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.360> went<00:02:22.480> off

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
we were saying just before we went off

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.390 
we were saying just before we went off
my<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> sometimes<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:23.980> LS<00:02:24.190> eyes

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
my is it sometimes you get in LS eyes

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.430 
my is it sometimes you get in LS eyes
and<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.670> feels<00:02:24.970> like<00:02:25.209> you've<00:02:25.720> got<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> solid<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
and it feels like you've got a solid to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.350 
and it feels like you've got a solid to
the<00:02:26.530> metal<00:02:26.739> frame<00:02:27.099> around<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:27.849> it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
the metal frame around you but it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.030 
the metal frame around you but it's
almost<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.080> airfryer<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.800> know<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
almost like the airfryer you know the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.619 
almost like the airfryer you know the
stuff<00:02:30.190> around<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> panel's<00:02:31.120> almost<00:02:31.450> just

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
stuff around it the panel's almost just

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.050 
stuff around it the panel's almost just
glued<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.830> rather<00:02:33.160> haphazard<00:02:33.670> way<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
glued on in a rather haphazard way I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.380 
glued on in a rather haphazard way I
like<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.110> fact<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.530> feels<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.040> solid<00:02:36.459> yes

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
like the fact that it feels so solid yes

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.440 
like the fact that it feels so solid yes
I<00:02:37.690> mean<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.170> vvv<00:02:38.769> or<00:02:39.220> manufacturing<00:02:39.819> and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
I mean the vvv or manufacturing and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.600 
I mean the vvv or manufacturing and
maintaining<00:02:41.260> GA<00:02:41.500> standard<00:02:42.069> for<00:02:42.340> our

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
maintaining GA standard for our

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.690 
maintaining GA standard for our
production<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> really<00:02:45.489> big

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
production so there is a really big

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.300 
production so there is a really big
difference<00:02:45.880> between<00:02:46.510> us<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.349> other<00:02:47.680> full<00:02:48.069> and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
difference between us and other full and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880 
difference between us and other full and
plastic<00:02:48.670> ultra<00:02:49.209> lights<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:50.019> really<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.739> are

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
plastic ultra lights so really they are

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.650 
plastic ultra lights so really they are
meeting<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.400> highest<00:02:51.760> standard<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.599> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
meeting the highest standard in the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.539 
meeting the highest standard in the
industry<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:53.769> if<00:02:53.890> people<00:02:54.130> haven't<00:02:54.310> seen<00:02:54.430> a

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
industry now if people haven't seen a

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.699 
industry now if people haven't seen a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.850 
one which is open already and we've got
the<00:03:01.030> engine<00:03:01.290> outside<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.500> tell<00:03:02.620> me<00:03:02.739> what

the engine outside just tell me what

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.259 
the engine outside just tell me what
engine<00:03:03.160> are<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.340> using<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.060> because

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
engine are you using in this because

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.670 
engine are you using in this because
there<00:03:04.390> were<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> couple<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.079> choices<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
there were a couple of choices on that

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.190 
there were a couple of choices on that
right<00:03:06.130> right<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.420> most<00:03:07.599> preferable

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
right right but the most preferable

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.380 
right right but the most preferable
engine<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:08.980> rotax<00:03:09.790> standard<00:03:10.420> rotax<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:12.390> 100

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
engine is rotax standard rotax and 100

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.050 
engine is rotax standard rotax and 100
of<00:03:13.540> horsepowers<00:03:14.049> there<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.130> also<00:03:15.340> an<00:03:15.730> option

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
of horsepowers there is also an option

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.110 
of horsepowers there is also an option
to<00:03:16.269> choose<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.019> jabber<00:03:17.290> engines<00:03:17.829> but<00:03:18.370> it's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
to choose the jabber engines but it's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.809 
to choose the jabber engines but it's
primarily<00:03:19.569> for<00:03:20.019> countries<00:03:20.890> with<00:03:21.609> higher

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
primarily for countries with higher

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.780 
primarily for countries with higher
elevation<00:03:22.480> like<00:03:23.109> certain<00:03:24.100> countries<00:03:24.549> in<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
elevation like certain countries in the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.870 
elevation like certain countries in the
United<00:03:25.150> States<00:03:25.359> maybe<00:03:26.019> in<00:03:26.170> Brazil<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:26.799> Brazil

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
United States maybe in Brazil in Brazil

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.809 
United States maybe in Brazil in Brazil
jabiru<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.180> jeans<00:03:28.359> are<00:03:28.569> very<00:03:28.780> popular<00:03:28.989> but

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
jabiru and jeans are very popular but

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.520 
jabiru and jeans are very popular but
let's<00:03:30.819> say<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.180> seventy<00:03:31.810> eighty<00:03:31.989> percent<00:03:32.230> of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
let's say it's seventy eighty percent of

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.620 
let's say it's seventy eighty percent of
the<00:03:32.650> production<00:03:33.100> goes<00:03:33.340> with<00:03:33.579> Rotax<00:03:33.970> engines<00:03:34.090> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
the production goes with Rotax engines I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.120 
the production goes with Rotax engines I
think<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.109> well-known<00:03:35.319> brand<00:03:35.709> as<00:03:35.859> well<00:03:35.889> as

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
think it's a well-known brand as well as
