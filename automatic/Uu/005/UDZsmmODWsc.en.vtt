 here reading this is with a new theme 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.619
 this time game big or gambito well without 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.270
 nothing more to say let's start with 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.260
 vitoria his first appearance in a can and 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.029
 x-men number 266 in August 1960 was 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.949
 created by chris claremont and the artist 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.320
 jim reads besides that it was drawn by 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.630
 mike collins well let's start with your 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.489
 history of milwaukee ni is the true 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.140
 name of remy gambit was abandoned and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.030
 later kidnapped by a guild of 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.220
 thief they called him the devil 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.260
 white since they believed that the boy remi 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.790
 it's a prophecy that said he would be 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.710
 the one indicated to join the hermes of 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.809
 thieves and murderers write state in 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.670
 war constantly like that was like rem and 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.559
 he grew up as a street thief up 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.659
 that one day he tried to rob the patriarch 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.400
 the guild of thieves this one to see the 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.440
 remix potential decided to adopt it 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.150
 as one more of his family so remy 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.589
 I would go to work for the lebu without 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.390
 But his powers would show 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.860
 Early in his teens he so 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.960
 worship his powers to his family 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.550
 practicing secretly that was how 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.560
 participated in several missions for his 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.830
 family some of these involved 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.460
 other 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.560
 as face and wolverine and even came to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.570
 encountering light was successful in many 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.150
 of these but in others for example with 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.340
 weapon x where gambit had to recover 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.620
 some planes of weapon x disillusionment to his 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 family since he burned the planes and 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.370
 not only was delivered to the customer without 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 But to reconcile their family 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.330
 married with night watchman is being grandson of 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.160
 patriarch of the assassins guild this 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.720
 to look for a bit of peace between both 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.760
 guilds however after the wedding 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.000
 his brother Julian challenges gambit to a duel 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.250
 in this duel also kills julien being 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 thus exiled from the city ​​and losing the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.540
 love of the night table and it would be like that during a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.670
 exile time that gambit would try to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.740
 control his powers however not to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.510
 to do so had to contact the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.920
 sinister it was as sinister as 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.500
 removed part of the brainstem at 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 this took away great power without 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 But it was beneficial because gambit 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 he could control his powers 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.510
 however sinister he charged the favor 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.180
 Leader in the field of a group 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.890
 called the marauders curiously 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.780
 one of its members was saber-toothed 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.730
 his mission was to end the life of 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.260
 the morlocks these were a group of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.610
 mutants that were totally 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.980
 killed by the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
 wheelers however campito tried to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.240
 stop them but everything was useless 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.650
 only managed to save a clear girl 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.340
 this after they became the leader 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.910
 mutant terrorist well done invito 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.830
 well done we continue after this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.720
 gambit was forced to wander alone and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.940
 aimlessly around the world which helped 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.890
 escape from that strange little docking 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.050
 it turned out to be stones who was part of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.709
 the x-men helped gambit to enter with 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.209
 they 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.550
 however gambit always maintained its 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.530
 distance and some secrets for example 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 their past and the massacre of the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.880
 marauders like that gambito participated 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.130
 often with the average x but not 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.720
 I know little by little your trust however 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.690
 then his secrets came to light 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.520
 first its past when belladonna its 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.250
 old wife returns to attack the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.080
 x-men the gambit step is exposed if 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.330
 well it is a cause or big problem what 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.100
 yes it caused it was the killing this was known 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.880
 thanks to Roach with whom I had 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.380
 A relationship 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.900
 this relationship is considered one of the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.310
 better between failures as you know rose 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.050
 has the ability to absorb 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.270
 thoughts and skills of who 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.549
 touches was like after a kiss with 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.720
 Gambit realized the killing like this 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.520
 that was with saber teeth 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.350
 to find out the truth if it was like 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.600
 Rose decided to get away from him in a way 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.490
 similar did the x-men 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.080
 abandoning it in Antarctica this as 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.700
 a punishment or a trial 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.410
 so the scope had done so was 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.540
 as a gambit obsessed by betrayal 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.850
 of the x-men but above all of his love 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
 had a single goal to return to the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.640
 united states 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.830
 it was as well as Gambit found a 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.600
 be enigmatic called new are or 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.430
 literally translated as the new 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.020
 son with this one made a deal so that what 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.210
 will lead directly to the us 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.890
 becoming gambit in his 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.570
 messenger once back in the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.340
 the united states while remy stole a 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.290
 jewel for the new son he found with 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.370
 the x-men which accepted it from 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.930
 new to the team 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.459
 -is and remi went back to work with the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.050
 x-men one of the most important reasons 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.080
 for those who have seen return to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.940
 team was because I still loved road to and what 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.650
 pretty they are continuing with the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.180
 history so some were published 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.770
 stories more than shrimp but the most 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.900
 relevant has to seem was when the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.940
 new sound or the new son showed up 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.590
 like the gambi itself is gambit of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.330
 an alternate reality and in its own 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.190
 actually the kinetic charge powers 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.290
 of the new son had exploded out of 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.570
 control burning the world and killing 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.009
 all around him as a result the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.569
 new son chased 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.550
 to all its alternate versions for 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.139
 avoid that they made the same mistake like this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.300
 it was like it came with gambit since 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.309
 He wanted to destroy it so he would not commit 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.139
 this clear error at the end gambito then 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.789
 he defeated him but this victory had a 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.680
 great price if you remember when 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.809
 sinister helped the gambit to control 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.149
 his powers this one took away much of 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.949
 they however remy previously 

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.749
 had managed to obtain these powers 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.759
 back but with this battle the 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.979
 he lost again creating his power 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.499
 kinetic at the same level as always 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.939
 let's go fast extreme x-men in this 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.949
 Gambit story lose their powers 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.839
 since an alien race that invades the 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.699
 land and will face against the x-men 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:08.830
 wants to use his powers and those of 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.259
 rose however these end 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.479
 removing the powers and remaining gambit 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.249
 and roush like simple humans these two 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.529
 they tried to live their quiet life and 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.389
 happily , however, the couple does not 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.099
 he could get away from the problems and the 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.719
 x-men that in the end they returned the 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.459
 powers and good what scope did he turn to 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.289
 join the teams but only this field 

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:28.689
 calypso came to earth and became 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.180
 scope in death 4 is to say a rider 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.800
 of the apocalypse 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.900
 in this story the same apocalypse 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.639
 says Gambit found peace between 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.009
 the two beings that live in the is 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.900
 the scope and death thus creating a 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.729
 new being and shedding of his past 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.620
 easily in this story gambit 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.690
 come back with the numbers of adores up 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.669
 how good they beat the sinister lord and 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.270
 Gambit retires to explore itself 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.800
 same 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.389
 clear without the powers of death 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.400
 after this the return to the x-men 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.889
 where we see a little gambit 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.750
 helpful since it helps the teacher a lot 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.699
 Charles later published some 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.949
 good stories where Gambit had a 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.750
 medium participation but well we come to 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.610
 schism where there is an internal fight between 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.710
 wolverine and cycles where wolverine 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.720
 try to retrain the school in 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.520
 west chester where gambito accepts and it 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.199
 returns a teacher in this school in ex 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.270
 I was in joyce really gambit 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.380
 it did not have much relevance however 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.000
 we can say that the scope always 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.320
 was on the side of the strap to 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.910
 principle refused to enter the 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.289
 however conflict when he 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.849
 account that the avengers' were 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.979
 doing their job badly their level the 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.840
 mutants although with the arrival of the phoenix 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.639
 Well, he had to finally join 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.320
 the avengers to stop and well 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.690
 after this gambit returns then to 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.889
 steal while it was still an x-men what 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.930
 that caused some fury between him 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.729
 especially wolverine who came to speak 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.159
 with him however the gambit came to him 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.770
 a job and so joined the 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.900
 ex factor where this is currently 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.270
 thanks to a polaris invitation to 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.460
 join the former factor and well now let's see 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.779
 powers and abilities gambit has the 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.240
 ability to convert energy 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.460
 potential to store an object in energy 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.289
 kinetics loading this and doing it 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.240
 exploiting this power is very much linked to 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.159
 what object do you want to blow up 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.060
 example the cards he carries are objects 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.949
 very small 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.289
 so making them explode is very easy 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.659
 for him this kinetic energy also 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.340
 It gives a great agility to paddle in addition to 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.349
 that your mind is immune to tele palés 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.090
 since it creates a kind of interference 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.430
 static and here maybe a power that does not 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.620
 he knew the hypnotic charm gambit 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.180
 has the ability to convince or deceive 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.710
 the people to do what he wants 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.900
 however the telepaths or very people 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.819
 intelligent are immune to these powers 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.889
 or also if they realize that gambit 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.779
 he wants to do this his skills like 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:33.550
 agent of the apocalypse consist of 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:35.199
 turn the unbreathable air into gases 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.879
 poisonous in addition to their letters 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.740
 can decompose living matter 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.569
 besides that you can control them with the 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.950
 mind and good for this occasion it 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.750
 finished the video 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.240
 I liked it, I loved doing it 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.490
 I really fell in love with the character and 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.120
 I liked it a lot because now much more 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.710
 I hope that you also and well this 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.600
 it's all for now caritas says goodbye 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.600
 saliva
