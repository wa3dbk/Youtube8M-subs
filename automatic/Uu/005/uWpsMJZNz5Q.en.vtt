00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.799
 today we take a closer look 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.380
 on the Land Rover series of the vintage 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.210
 2000 14 employees range rover the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.679
 range rover sport the evoque and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.009
 of course not to forget 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.539
 discovery we went with the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.490
 highlights the brand on a very 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.349
 Interesting round trip to and from 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.660
 Zurich on Strasbourg and the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.790
 Black Forest and how it is the land rover 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.950
 models was written in the tribe book 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.440
 You and we had to go through the customers 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.750
 By water harassment in which the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.850
 afford to sank through 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.880
 muddy terrain furrows with listening 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.830
 as if there was no tomorrow but that should be 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.720
 not be everything 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.130
 the discovery model year 2014 is 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.780
 become much more self-confident 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.450
 next to new seemingly he tolerates his 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 Names now also on the front first time 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.230
 comes with the new 3 liter v6 gasoline 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.500
 Compressor for the use of the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.200
 previous five liter v8 replaced 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.719
 performances from 211 to 340 ps and a 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.329
 torque up to 600 newton meters 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.219
 make the discovery very agile on the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.619
 off-road track shows us the discovery 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.600
 what he is capable of and, above all, what he is capable of 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.460
 the new white sands are in the system 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 about the all landrover models now 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.270
 The water depth will be here 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.369
 automatically measured 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810
 Range Rover offers for his big 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.939
 now also a diesel hybrid 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.109
 that saves fuel properly 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.850
 normal diesel engine will be here 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.679
 supported by a 35 kilowatt 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.469
 electric motor 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.630
 The system performance is at 340 ps 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.140
 700 newton meters and that at one 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.840
 Consumption of 6.4 liters 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.430
 Almost silently, the hybrid started before the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.620
 diesel starts its work 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.320
 the interaction of both units 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.600
 works perfect and unobtrusive 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.090
 there is a lack of sufficient power 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.100
 no situation dominated by the hybrid 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.190
 the relaxed cruising as well as the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.410
 sporty gang very sovereign his 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.940
 enormous skills sidewalk and Vaud 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.590
 through mud and water have again 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.130
 proved that we are here with one 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.650
 real thoroughbred offroader have to do with 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.239
 however one of the extremely luxurious 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.700
 is equipped but who should that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.770
 probably disturbing despite the tortures in the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 heavy terrain and extremely fast 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.150
 passages through the mountains we came up 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.120
 a consumption of only 9 2 liters 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.130
 that has already impressed us the range 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.959
 rover sports model year 2014 has a lot 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.010
 a lot of new technologies on board 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.470
 other lane assist and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.480
 Traffic sign recognition like the name 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.519
 the sport is firmer 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480
 designed and even more agile than 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.880
 big Brother 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.269
 He is currently considered fastest and 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.519
 most active land rover has his own 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.920
 alu bodywork architecture shares the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.160
 save more than 420 kilos 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.040
 new is the 4.4 liter v8 diesel of us 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.440
 with its 3 139 ps and unbelievable 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.490
 700 newton meters at each contact with 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.350
 the gas pedal book 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.030
 Systems like the adaptive landing gear 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.160
 control or tilt control 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.530
 rode the motorway passages to 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.360
 purest pleasure during our 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.760
 brisk stage through the black forest 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.100
 Approved the v8, however, and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.840
 help liter the most important innovation in the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.570
 evoque the new stages automatic 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.310
 the world's first in series 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.780
 to be honest , the automatic adds 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.560
 we do not have a direct impression 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.900
 leave 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.630
 that speaks for their inconspicuous and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.400
 Perfect work only when looking at the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.500
 tachometer and the consumption indicator 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.710
 becomes clear that the evoque always in 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.180
 A perfect walk is much fun 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.520
 you have as a manual manual 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.680
 switch through by switching the teeter 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.740
 digits 1 to 9 are just going to fly like that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.770
 through the complete many innovations 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.990
 Berlin threatens models 20 14 hybrid range 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.260
 rover and range rover sport the new 3 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.810
 liter supercharged at the discovery the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.880
 World's first nine-speed automatic transmission 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.960
 range rover evoque and paired to it yet 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.240
 many technological options in the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.560
 traffic safety traffic assist 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.570
 traffic signs children so let's 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 really crack it 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.110
 after all the slopes mud and 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.240
 water passages waited for the end of 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.180
 tour on a special kind of exam 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.190
 us the motto when it comes up 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.830
 if it goes down again we were led 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.400
 away directly over a ski jump 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.380
 but totally downhill 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.330
 there was good advice already on 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.570
 Stanzentisch the driving mode rock roll 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.160
 german rock crawl to choose thanks 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.020
 We could enjoy the view 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.300
 and came good abroad 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.610
 that should also landrover succeed 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.720
 are prepared for the special purpose 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.720
 the models all
