00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it does it very well the reason I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
it does it very well the reason I
switched<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> had<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.480> thin

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
switched was because I had a very thin

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
switched was because I had a very thin
base<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.530> wasn't<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.890> existant<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
base it wasn't on existant it just it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
base it wasn't on existant it just it
was<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.450> lacking<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.289> wanted<00:00:46.530> something

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
was very lacking and I wanted something

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
was very lacking and I wanted something
represented<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.399> voice<00:00:47.640> better<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.180> after

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
represented my voice better so after

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
represented my voice better so after
about<00:00:48.539> three<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:48.930> four<00:00:49.140> months<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.680> comparing

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
about three or four months of comparing

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
about three or four months of comparing
and<00:00:50.340> researching<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.000> honed<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.140> one

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and researching I honed in on this one

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.630 
and researching I honed in on this one
but<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> end-all<00:00:53.579> be-all

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
