00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.440
 well let's start with the tag and the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.080
 first question that asks us is what 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.809
 Animal crossing has played good, well, I 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.090
 I have played the animal crossing we're world 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.940
 he has played time al animal crossing let's 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.010
 go to the city that is my favorite 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
 played animal crossing you live and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.230
 I have also played animal crossing of 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.909
 the gamecube that is out there that good 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.739
 I'll show you that in another video that 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.059
 It would be 2000 animal crossing games 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.729
 that I have pending that video does 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.220
 a lot of time and I will show you all the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.290
 things that I have of animal crossing 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 so then we go with the second 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.320
 question that tells us what thematic of the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 Main town is your favorite 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.490
 of Japanese or modern tale good 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.110
 I think my favorite fabulous theme 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.299
 Well, you know that I love the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.050
 colors the color designs and everything 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.320
 that 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.330
 I'm going to stay with the story tail 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.830
 but the Japanese bring me quite like 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.160
 but I prefer the story 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.990
 totally then the third question is 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.210
 what are your favorite neighbors 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.150
 Well, my favorites, I have them here 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.220
 I need one that is fat che no 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.440
 I have the stuffed animal but good one of my 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.700
 favorite neighbors is rod and as ya 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.310
 you know the other one is my patches and then 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 also then my fat woman that the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.940
 truth that is very much love to 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.490
 this neighbor and one of the neighbors more 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.610
 Hated, I'm going to say it's a Nativity 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.710
 that is a bee and because it was good 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.830
 in animal crossing the goal and the truth 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.170
 that gave me a lot the can not leave me in 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.440
 peace always persecuted me and good the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.760
 true that a neighbor's chaos and nothing to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.270
 who do not want it 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.430
 then the question the number 5 is that 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.440
 remove aunts from the last game in the saga 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.300
 of animal crossing that would remove then I 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.120
 would remove the mania of putting the projects 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.489
 and the power to put them a bit more more 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.390
 freely because there are places for example 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.550
 in which it is worth that there is a house 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.190
 but somehow so it would get 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.010
 to put then instead of yes 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.190
 you have to respect a box that is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.320
 I could 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.110
 so that it was only half 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.630
 so what the way to put the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.890
 designs and then the rest I think that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.110
 remove I do not know how to remove would not take away anything 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.120
 and the next question is that whoever 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.710
 so we would definitely add a voice chat 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.140
 animal crossing is that it has to have 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.120
 the voice chat looks like it looks like 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.550
 we have stepped back in time since we 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.230
 have removed the bot chat we had what 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.390
 we had in will and I do not understand 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.980
 because our nintendo 3ds has 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.440
 microphones because we can not talk to 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.440
 the friends just like they have other games 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.630
 like for example pokemon or then that 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.360
 the truth I'm a very big fault of the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:32.410
 chat but well you see let's see now 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.630
 and it tells us what your favorite event is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.480
 animal crossing favorite event is the 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.510
 and next week is definitely good 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.520
 above all it was in wii and it's the day of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.569
 turkey the day today they were giving themselves a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.769
 kiss 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.769
 and I'm in love with all your tutor 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.079
 nothing nothing poop poop on the face 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:59.989
 I visit his face the little face there is in the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.139
 face and well my favorite event is the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.269
 turkey day I love that celebrity and 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.819
 I believe that here in the halloween but 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.519
 as I say I liked them more in the wii 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.060
 I saw them much more fun there but 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.940
 good that you have in the new life so I 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.720
 I'll stay with the day of the turkey and then to 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.030
 see what is your favorite station in the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.389
 game well, if it refers to 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.039
 train station because I will be left with 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.280
 the Japanese can make me a station 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.650
 super cool super original natural and if 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.960
 it's the season of the year, because without a doubt 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.660
 summer that is when more plus bugs there 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.270
 more fish is that I love I love 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.599
 the summer animal crossing and I would definitely 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.150
 what's left then the ninth is what is your 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.639
 favorite game because as I said the one of 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.070
 wii because in the wii as we were was 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.650
 everything more free more natural more fun 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.780
 the friends the people is that it was all 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.180
 different, not because now, with so much 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.460
 design and so piloted so the truth 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.159
 is that people forget a lot about 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.710
 the important mind that is 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.930
 Funny animal crossing and stop 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.440
 side then being able to run for the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.020
 peoples freely the power is that if you 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 Breaks the flower because it breaks but the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.070
 to be able to enjoy tournaments in the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.889
 town without having to go to the island or 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.870
 nothing the tournaments do in the town 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.349
 running with friends to hunt 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.780
 bugs to fish for everything and the 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.310
 I think that I do not speak either 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.499
 much the short because that's because 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.210
 now it's boring because always watching 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.249
 the people always seeing villages there are 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.930
 play and have fun you have to run around 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.629
 the villages but like no people do you 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.150
 they leave because everyone is there goes my 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.610
 village the bighorn passes this and it is true 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.379
 It costs a lot of work, but I do not 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.169
 I know, I think that's why I stay with 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.539
 the wii that we took everything 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.629
 more like a game like what it is and not 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.659
 as a competition of super towns and 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.159
 good the tenth is that you think of who 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.900
 be in all events of all 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.210
 regions in all animal games 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.930
 crossing for example you go natta 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.389
 Japan the european marmot blah blah blah 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.069
 blah blah blah blah blah blah then good to 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.009
 I think this is great because this 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.289
 way is played with Japanese people I've 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.599
 played with American people I could 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.120
 exchange things with them because what of 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.400
 otherwise they would have them in my town and 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.699
 I would not have had the pleasure of 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.979
 of having been able to attend the events in 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.259
 a different town then I said it 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.470
 I think it seems great to me 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:40.220
 I live in Spain it is normal that there 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:43.250
 events that may be in Japan or may 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.120
 have in america then from there then 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.650
 it seems good to me and good guys from 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.410
 dismiss and here the video forgive me a 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.810
 little face is that it's a little bit late 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.639
 no and today the truth is that apart from 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.750
 I'm pretty cold after or not 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:02.900
 there were many videos on the channel 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.930
 I'm pretty tired and good so here 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.670
 the pancho roof is already there 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.520
 you have it you do not have to sign up 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.700

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.920

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.620
