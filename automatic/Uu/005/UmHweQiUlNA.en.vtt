00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.910 

and<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:43.850> looks<00:00:44.059> like<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.420> gets<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.870> be

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and that looks like it gets to be

they<00:00:46.429> can<00:00:46.609> always<00:00:46.969> stop<00:00:47.269> it<00:00:47.480> every<00:00:47.780> play<00:00:48.050> is

a<00:00:51.400> great<00:00:51.970> effort<00:00:52.180> by<00:00:52.480> Dean<00:00:52.750> Milner<00:00:53.200> but<00:00:53.380> I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
a great effort by Dean Milner but I

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.410 
a great effort by Dean Milner but I
think<00:00:53.650> maybe<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.950> better<00:00:54.280> effort<00:00:54.550> by<00:00:54.880> Eifert<00:00:55.330> to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
think maybe a better effort by Eifert to

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.850 
think maybe a better effort by Eifert to
be<00:00:55.540> able<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.750> hold<00:00:55.900> on<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> football

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860
