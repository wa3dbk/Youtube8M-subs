00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.680 

okay<00:00:01.650> so<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.920> quick<00:00:05.420> next<00:00:06.420> video

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
okay so this is the quick next video

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.709 
okay so this is the quick next video
it's<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.740> large<00:00:08.130> jump<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.760> know<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:09.360> what<00:00:09.540> he

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it's a large jump I know from what he

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's a large jump I know from what he
saw<00:00:09.990> last<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:12.030> actual<00:00:12.389> frame<00:00:12.809> itself<00:00:13.349> is

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
saw last the actual frame itself is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.670 
saw last the actual frame itself is
almost<00:00:14.280> done<00:00:15.289> but<00:00:16.289> again<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:18.680> retail

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
almost done but again just a retail

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.279 
almost done but again just a retail
which<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.980> already<00:00:20.250> know<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> guess<00:00:21.199> like<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
which you already know I guess like I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
which you already know I guess like I
said<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.220> glued<00:00:23.670> together<00:00:23.910> all

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
said it's all just glued together all

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.769 
said it's all just glued together all
these<00:00:24.570> pieces<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.410> there's<00:00:25.830> dowel<00:00:26.279> rods

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
these pieces and there's dowel rods

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.080 
these pieces and there's dowel rods
through<00:00:27.779> each<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> those<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.670> each<00:00:29.849> one

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
through each of those so they each one

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
through each of those so they each one
of<00:00:30.179> these<00:00:30.269> joints<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of these joints right here here all of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.330 
of these joints right here here all of
this<00:00:32.880> joints<00:00:33.450> has<00:00:33.570> been<00:00:33.750> glued<00:00:33.989> does<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.190> an

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
this joints has been glued does have an

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.119 
this joints has been glued does have an
extra<00:00:35.640> dowel<00:00:35.820> rod<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.660> through<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
extra dowel rod right in through it

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.380 
extra dowel rod right in through it
that's<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> increase<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.879> strength<00:00:39.149> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that's just to increase the strength so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
that's just to increase the strength so
it<00:00:39.480> doesn't<00:00:39.750> split<00:00:40.170> along<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:43.399> that's

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it doesn't split along here and that's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.850 
it doesn't split along here and that's
how<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> whole<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.360> built<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.930> glued

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
how the whole thing was built just glued

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
how the whole thing was built just glued
piece<00:00:47.280> by<00:00:47.489> piece<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.629> can<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
piece by piece you can just see how I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
piece by piece you can just see how I
just<00:00:52.289> glued<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> piece<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:54.050> just<00:00:55.050> wrap<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
just glued a piece on just wrap the the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
just glued a piece on just wrap the the
cord<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> clamp<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> far<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
cord around it as a clamp so far in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.729 
cord around it as a clamp so far in
terms<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.760> how<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.239> working

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
terms of how well it's working

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
terms of how well it's working
you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.189> working<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.850> well

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can see it's working out pretty well

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660 
you can see it's working out pretty well
in<00:01:06.510> terms<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.530> rapid<00:01:08.010> construction

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in terms of a pretty rapid construction

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
in terms of a pretty rapid construction
process<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.100> hole<00:01:11.340> seems<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> be

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
process and that hole seems to be

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.460 
process and that hole seems to be
holding<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.240> pretty<00:01:12.299> strong<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.049> terms<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
holding up pretty strong in terms of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.670 
holding up pretty strong in terms of the
amount<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> flex<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:15.560> once<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
amount of flex that it's got once I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.240 
amount of flex that it's got once I
connected<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.310> two<00:01:17.700> pieces<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:20.040> gas

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
connected these two pieces here the gas

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.399 
connected these two pieces here the gas
tank<00:01:20.580> shapes<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
tank shapes gonna be right here and the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
tank shapes gonna be right here and the
the<00:01:22.439> bottom<00:01:22.920> rail<00:01:23.280> once<00:01:24.240> those<00:01:24.390> pieces<00:01:24.600> were

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the bottom rail once those pieces were

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
the bottom rail once those pieces were
connected<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.590> took<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
connected it actually took a lot of the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.920 
connected it actually took a lot of the
Flex<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.630> still<00:01:27.869> see

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Flex out of it and you can still see

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
Flex out of it and you can still see
there's<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:30.420> most<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
there's a little bit of it but most of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's a little bit of it but most of
us<00:01:31.110> gone<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.140> around

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
us gone and then you can come around

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
us gone and then you can come around
through<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
through this way look at it from the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.859 
through this way look at it from the
back<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
back you can probably see from that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.289 
back you can probably see from that
angle<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.189> bit<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> crook

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
angle it's got a little bit of a crook

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.130 
angle it's got a little bit of a crook
to<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> little<00:01:44.220> crooked<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.509> again

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to it it's a little crooked but again

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
to it it's a little crooked but again
that's<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.159> many<00:01:47.220> pieces

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that's because with so many pieces

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.420 
that's because with so many pieces
connected<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.560> each<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
connected you know each one could have a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.889 
connected you know each one could have a
little<00:01:50.759> bit<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.180> difference<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.810> would

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
little bit of difference that would

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
little bit of difference that would
torque<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.619> shape<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.360> I'm<00:01:54.360> actually

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
torque it out of shape so I'm actually

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
torque it out of shape so I'm actually
probably<00:01:54.780> proud<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> how<00:01:55.350> straight<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.860> got

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
probably proud of how straight I got

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.609 
probably proud of how straight I got
that<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.750> still<00:01:57.960> wish<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.170> did<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.469> bit

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that but I still wish I did a little bit

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.530 
that but I still wish I did a little bit
better

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
better

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.430 
better
so<00:02:00.170> yeah<00:02:00.320> that's<00:02:00.650> pretty<00:02:00.710> much<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:01.250> far

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
so yeah that's pretty much it so far

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.630 
so yeah that's pretty much it so far
like<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:03.560> said<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> big<00:02:04.310> jump<00:02:04.460> from

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
like I said I know it's a big jump from

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.190 
like I said I know it's a big jump from
the<00:02:04.730> last<00:02:04.910> video<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.790> hopefully<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.050> get

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
the last video but hopefully you can get

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.719 
the last video but hopefully you can get
a<00:02:09.260> pretty<00:02:09.410> good<00:02:09.590> idea<00:02:09.680> of<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.950> process<00:02:10.430> I<00:02:10.580> just

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
a pretty good idea of the process I just

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.100 
a pretty good idea of the process I just
wanted<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.240> skip<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> boring

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
wanted to kind of skip all the boring

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.620 
wanted to kind of skip all the boring
here's<00:02:13.040> another<00:02:13.280> piece<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.730> glued<00:02:13.970> on<00:02:14.120> here's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
here's another piece I glued on here's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.860 
here's another piece I glued on here's
another<00:02:14.900> piece<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.290> glued<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:17.090> that's<00:02:17.750> what

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
another piece I glued on so that's what

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.980 
another piece I glued on so that's what
you<00:02:17.990> got<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.640> probably<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.270> next<00:02:20.360> video<00:02:20.750> will

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
you got and probably the next video will

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.560 
you got and probably the next video will
be<00:02:21.080> once<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.530> frame<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.770> complete<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.790> I've

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
be once the frame is complete and I've

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.720 
be once the frame is complete and I've
done<00:02:23.990> some<00:02:24.260> initial<00:02:24.470> shaping<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.310> stuffed<00:02:25.610> it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370

the<00:02:28.550> shape<00:02:28.790> here<00:02:29.120> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.290> know<00:02:30.410> make<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
the shape here kind of you know make the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.160 
the shape here kind of you know make the
pieces<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.280> fork<00:02:31.520> right<00:02:31.760> here<00:02:32.170> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
pieces for the fork right here so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.210 
pieces for the fork right here so
there's<00:02:33.380> still<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.560> lot<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.710> work<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.070> done

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
there's still a lot of work to be done

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.820 
there's still a lot of work to be done
but<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.180> frames<00:02:35.360> almost<00:02:35.660> done<00:02:35.870> I'm<00:02:36.590> pretty

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
