00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello friends of lives in network and nomadic 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:09.920
 digital here you have the mific of the cable 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.129
 that I had been looking for the exemplary 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.340
 boy outside and well, here you can 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.619
 see the mici box has its small 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.849
 screen where very information appears 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.760
 interesting and it's from the huawei brand that 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.900
 it's what you have, you see, I'm going to stop 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:36.570
 much supports hsp to plus 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:41.100
 wi-fi b / g / n support edge gprs gsm up 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 21 theoretical megabytes of download and also 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.370
 admit that month is a thing apart from the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.550
 web browser has an ip and allows 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.829
 well 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.109
 and connect to the ip of the missile 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.510
 and use it you want to see what happens 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.460
 when we turn it on, look at this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.519
 the appearance first of all that it has 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 It's super nice, I like it a lot 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.970
 very very attractive good is my hand 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.619
 but we can do them to make you a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.619
 idea let's put 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.550
 something that serves as a reference for you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.880
 you get the idea of ​​the size that is a 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.420
 one euro currency that we all know and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.720
 This is the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.270
 the size it has 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 the little one is smaller than a mouse 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 of these kids 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.410
 okay 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 has here to the side then the button 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.370
 on and vps to make a pin and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 connect directly here 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.950
 the button they speak opens the casing 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950
 frontal 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.430
 this I have no idea what it is 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.780
 Supports a microsd card 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.640
 and this is for charging in a minibus or 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.910
 when we turn it on it is charged and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.910
 all 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.130
 here you can see 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.080
 the power on screen and is let's say 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.510
 one of the great things anise has and 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.690
 which is to give a button to turn it on and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 use it and if you want to turn it off give it another 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.830
 time to the button 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.830
 and turn it off 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.680
 has values icons the wifi on 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.680
 the roaming 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.900
 a data counter 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.900
 the battery charge the signal 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.280
 very interesting great let's see more 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.460
 little things of him so that you can do to yourself 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.460
 an idea 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.159
 select the miff's wifi network and it's 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.670
 here on my side and we put their 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.670
 password 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.710
 we are connecting to the place the wifi 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.710
 from huawei 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.940
 and look what we have here we have 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.030
 We are connected to the same router with 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.230
 the signal and internet connection 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.010
 etcetera battery and let's put 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.010
 the key 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.330
 what options do we have then look at the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.330
 options that we have here of the little boy 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.120
 we are connected to tuenti 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.780
 let's pay the rest for the speed of 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.910
 connection and the type of network 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.330
 and very important encryption has 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.220
 a pretty secure encryption 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.740
 and good the current volume of data and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.810
 connection the total connection more or less 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.020
 it's 6 hours what can last 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.290
 which are connected those visited and 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.819
 we can also send sms is very 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.500
 interesting in that month is to say being 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.739
 you have to configure the parameters I do not 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.709
 I have a role I do not know if these are the 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.940
 those of Tuenti and the first thing 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.950
 what to do is actually create a 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.440
 profile a profile where you have to put 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.870
 because all are the data of the pn 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.560
 etcetera more things that we have here and 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.760
 we have for the line connection 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.060
 basic configurations after 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.060
 Milan 6 and I just want to change 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.120
 and I really do not know the key in the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.680
 changed it 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.680
 the channel in which we emit 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.060
 filters plus hps vps configuration 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:57.140
 The truth is that as a Wi-Fi router, 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.860
 quite pretty powerful filters more 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:05.670
 firewall configuration zone 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:11.910
 demilitarized and the diagnostic system 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:15.330
 it's password and all this you know what 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.850
 it's very very interesting and we went 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.710
 happy with the possibilities that we 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.880
 offers once configured as 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.340
 you can see then there is nothing to do 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.370
 practically nothing that yes that 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.840
 tell him you have to tell him this this 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.970
 very important that you connect 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.310
 automatically even when we're 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.220
 on roaming 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.670
 and good for the moment, friends, that's 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.670
 all
