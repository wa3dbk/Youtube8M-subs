00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.070 
along with the flower with the chair
ties<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.800> chair<00:02:22.100> tie<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.940> very<00:02:23.360> long<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.900> think

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
ties this chair tie is very long I think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.560 
ties this chair tie is very long I think
it<00:02:24.200> was<00:02:24.350> maybe<00:02:24.530> about<00:02:24.710> nine<00:02:25.070> feet<00:02:25.100> long<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
it was maybe about nine feet long so it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.900 
it was maybe about nine feet long so it
went<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> long<00:02:26.930> way<00:02:28.510> side<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.780> nice<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.230> tight

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
went a long way side that nice and tight

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.890 
went a long way side that nice and tight
ties<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.330> knot<00:02:32.540> now<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.450> use<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.780> even

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
ties it in a knot now if you use it even

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.480 
ties it in a knot now if you use it even
the<00:02:36.170> ceremony<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.860> they<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.990> think<00:02:38.990> that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
the ceremony on they have I think that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.120 
the ceremony on they have I think that
this<00:02:40.490> one<00:02:40.700> should<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:41.030> good<00:02:41.120> enough<00:02:42.130> because

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
this one should be good enough because

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.350 
this one should be good enough because
no<00:02:43.580> one<00:02:43.790> should<00:02:43.820> be<00:02:44.240> messing<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
no one should be messing with the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.310 
no one should be messing with the
arrangements<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.570> would<00:02:47.840> imagine<00:02:47.930> that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
arrangements and I would imagine that

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.970 
arrangements and I would imagine that
they<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.430> yourself<00:02:49.940> but<00:02:50.240> if<00:02:50.420> they<00:02:50.570> are

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
they they are yourself but if they are

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.780 
they they are yourself but if they are
just<00:02:51.980> make<00:02:52.130> sure<00:02:52.310> everyone<00:02:53.710> properly<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.730> I

just make sure everyone properly so I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.580 
just make sure everyone properly so I
took<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.150> bow<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.780> added<00:02:57.050> some<00:02:57.260> little

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
took the bow and I added some little

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.610

strangle things frame open up the tie to
the<00:03:00.920> bone<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:02.480> tied<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.510> ribbon<00:03:05.780> behind

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
the bone and I tied the ribbon behind

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.070 
the bone and I tied the ribbon behind

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.470 

look<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.690> already<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:22.000> gives<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
look at that already it gives you the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.820 
look at that already it gives you the
effect<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.080> want<00:03:23.110> all<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.620> make<00:03:23.800> sure

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
effect that you want all right make sure

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.150 
effect that you want all right make sure
you<00:03:24.100> cut<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.490> skirt<00:03:24.730> under<00:03:26.040> usually<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
you cut the skirt under usually the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.370 
you cut the skirt under usually the
chairs<00:03:27.520> are<00:03:27.880> lower<00:03:28.390> than<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.810> chair<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
chairs are lower than this chair this is

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.200 
chairs are lower than this chair this is
just<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.770> demonstration<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.670> like<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.970> said

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
just a demonstration it's like I said

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.350 
just a demonstration it's like I said
you<00:03:31.840> would<00:03:32.080> tuck<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.590> skirt<00:03:32.890> under<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.120> it

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
you would tuck the skirt under so it

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.330 
you would tuck the skirt under so it
would<00:03:34.540> drape<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.350> floor<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.980> giving<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
would drape on the floor and giving it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.330 
would drape on the floor and giving it
that<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.690> elegant<00:03:38.320> look

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that that elegant look

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.590 
that that elegant look
so<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:39.880> just<00:03:40.090> tie<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:42.070> chair<00:03:42.370> tied<00:03:42.730> into

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
so you just tie the chair tied into

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.020 
so you just tie the chair tied into
above<00:03:45.480> basically<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.430> have<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.820> bump

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
above basically there you have it bump

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.540 
above basically there you have it bump
up<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.450> loops<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.130> in<00:03:51.280> my<00:03:51.370> other

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
up the loops just like in my other

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.910 
up the loops just like in my other
videos<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.330> make<00:03:52.480> sure<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.990> them<00:03:53.320> it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
videos but make sure you them it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.140 
videos but make sure you them it
was<00:03:54.040> loose

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.880 

and<00:03:58.150> there<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:59.170> nice<00:03:59.380> simple

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
and there you have it a nice simple

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.890 
and there you have it a nice simple
arrangement<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.670> only<00:04:01.120> took<00:04:01.390> me<00:04:01.450> maybe<00:04:01.810> about

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
arrangement it only took me maybe about

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.540 
arrangement it only took me maybe about
two<00:04:02.260> minutes<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:02.800> just<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> make

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
two minutes but you just have to make

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.300 
two minutes but you just have to make
sure<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.210> you<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.350> everything<00:04:05.680> before<00:04:06.190> you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
sure that you have everything before you

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430 
sure that you have everything before you
actually<00:04:06.490> start<00:04:06.760> now<00:04:07.540> if<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.930> want<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.230> add

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
actually start now if you want to add

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.610 
actually start now if you want to add
something<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.490> netting<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:11.080> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
something like netting to the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.440 
something like netting to the
arrangement<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.880> first<00:04:16.090> rope

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
arrangement if this is the first rope

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.610 
arrangement if this is the first rope
just<00:04:17.200> make<00:04:17.410> sure<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.950> tie<00:04:19.110> I'm<00:04:20.110> just<00:04:20.350> going<00:04:20.530> to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
just make sure you tie I'm just going to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.530 
just make sure you tie I'm just going to
tuck<00:04:20.860> this<00:04:21.040> in<00:04:21.280> here<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:21.610> you<00:04:21.910> can<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.150> see

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
tuck this in here so you can just see

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.430 
tuck this in here so you can just see
what<00:04:22.750> I'm<00:04:22.870> saying

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
what I'm saying

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.600 
what I'm saying
just<00:04:23.830> tie<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.940> first<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.900> end<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
just tie the first the end of the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.670 
just tie the first the end of the
netting<00:04:28.000> or<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.720> this<00:04:29.080> arrangement<00:04:29.530> because

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
netting or to this arrangement because

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.220 
netting or to this arrangement because
the<00:04:30.160> meta<00:04:30.670> isn't<00:04:31.090> gonna<00:04:31.180> go<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.540> way<00:04:31.600> it's

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
the meta isn't gonna go this way it's

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.590 
the meta isn't gonna go this way it's
going<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.410> go<00:04:32.560> back<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.430> would<00:04:33.670> tie<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
going to go back so you would tie it and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.010 
going to go back so you would tie it and
then<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:35.560> would<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.860> basically<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:37.720> drape

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
then you would just basically just drape

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.560 
then you would just basically just drape
it<00:04:38.170> back<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:39.280> can<00:04:39.340> fluff<00:04:39.670> up<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.000> netting<00:04:40.390> and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
it back you can fluff up the netting and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.450 
it back you can fluff up the netting and
go<00:04:41.380> from<00:04:41.590> row<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.860> row<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.920> you<00:04:45.340> know

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
go from row to row and then you know
