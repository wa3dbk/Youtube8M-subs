course we have a manual and a note here

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.010 
course we have a manual and a note here
about<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.740> optimal<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.900> configure<00:01:38.900> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
about the optimal way to configure the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.400 
about the optimal way to configure the
power<00:01:39.200> supply<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.300> there<00:01:44.510> are<00:01:44.660> several<00:01:45.020> unique

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
power supply so there are several unique

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.250 
power supply so there are several unique
points<00:01:45.860> about<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.130> cable<00:01:47.030> set<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.450> ugh<00:01:47.960> owes

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
points about the cable set that ugh owes

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.410 
points about the cable set that ugh owes
to<00:01:48.500> include<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.190> first<00:01:49.790> let's<00:01:49.970> take<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.180> look<00:01:50.330> at

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
to include so first let's take a look at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.360 
to include so first let's take a look at
the<00:01:50.510> power<00:01:50.690> cable<00:01:51.230> this<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.560> 12-gauge

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
the power cable this is a 12-gauge

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.730 
the power cable this is a 12-gauge
really<00:01:53.270> really<00:01:53.540> heavy<00:01:53.690> duty<00:01:53.840> power<00:01:54.260> cable

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
really really heavy duty power cable

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.610 
really really heavy duty power cable
that<00:01:55.250> really<00:01:55.729> has<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.910> premium<00:01:56.420> look<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.470> let's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
that really has a premium look so let's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.350 
that really has a premium look so let's
take<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.860> look<00:02:01.040> at<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> 24<00:02:01.729> pin<00:02:02.000> power

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
take a look at the 24 pin power

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.650 
take a look at the 24 pin power
connector<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.680> can<00:02:03.860> see<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
connector so you can see that it is

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
connector so you can see that it is
individually<00:02:05.660> sleeved<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.410> there's

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
individually sleeved and there's

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.260 
individually sleeved and there's
actually<00:02:07.070> no<00:02:07.280> heat<00:02:07.550> shrink<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.149> really

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
actually no heat shrink so it's really

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.810 
actually no heat shrink so it's really
high<00:02:08.479> quality<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:09.170> all<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.130> power<00:02:10.340> cables

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
high quality and all of the power cables

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.550 
high quality and all of the power cables
that<00:02:11.030> are<00:02:11.060> included<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.110> power<00:02:12.290> supply

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
that are included in the power supply

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.350 
that are included in the power supply
are<00:02:13.060> 100-percent<00:02:14.060> individually<00:02:14.900> sleeved<00:02:19.360> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
are 100-percent individually sleeved so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.760 
are 100-percent individually sleeved so
now<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.690> time<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.230> take<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> look<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:21.709> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
now it's time to take a look at the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.610 
now it's time to take a look at the
power<00:02:21.950> supply

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.920 

so<00:02:26.280> inside<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> main<00:02:27.030> power<00:02:27.330> supply<00:02:27.510> box

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
so inside the main power supply box

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.770 
so inside the main power supply box
there<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.640> small<00:02:29.640> little<00:02:29.940> packet<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.959> and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
there is a small little packet here and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.130 
there is a small little packet here and
this<00:02:33.780> has<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> couple<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:35.239> rubber<00:02:36.239> feet<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.810> so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
this has a couple of rubber feet and so

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
this has a couple of rubber feet and so
these<00:02:37.319> rubber<00:02:37.620> feet<00:02:37.769> are<00:02:37.950> used<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.940> power

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
these rubber feet are used on the power

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.699 
these rubber feet are used on the power
supply<00:02:39.299> if<00:02:39.659> you're<00:02:39.810> using<00:02:40.019> an<00:02:40.230> outside<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
supply if you're using an outside of a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
supply if you're using an outside of a
chassis<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.459> doesn't<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.790> scratched<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
chassis so it doesn't get scratched and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
chassis so it doesn't get scratched and
it<00:02:42.959> also<00:02:43.220> includes<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> small<00:02:44.549> note<00:02:44.760> about<00:02:44.970> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it also includes a small note about this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.759 
it also includes a small note about this
as<00:02:45.329> well<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.329> EVGA

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
as well and here it is the EVGA

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.009 
as well and here it is the EVGA
supernova<00:02:52.769> next<00:02:53.340> 1500<00:02:54.180> watt<00:02:54.360> classified

power<00:02:55.260> supply<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.519> see<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.940> one

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
power supply so you can see it's one

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
power supply so you can see it's one
hundred<00:02:57.390> percent<00:02:57.569> modular<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:59.280> you'll

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
hundred percent modular and if you'll

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.699 
hundred percent modular and if you'll
notice<00:02:59.700> here<00:03:00.299> right<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.750> back<00:03:00.989> we<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
notice here right on the back we have a

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
notice here right on the back we have a
small<00:03:02.190> tab<00:03:02.519> tells<00:03:03.060> us<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.329> read<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> manual

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
small tab tells us to read the manual

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.990 
small tab tells us to read the manual
but<00:03:04.109> if<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.290> pull<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.680> off<00:03:04.709> we'll<00:03:05.579> see<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
but if we pull that off we'll see a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.229 
but if we pull that off we'll see a
bunch<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.480> small<00:03:07.019> dip<00:03:07.260> switches<00:03:07.590> back<00:03:07.859> there

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
bunch of small dip switches back there

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.520 
bunch of small dip switches back there
now<00:03:09.239> these<00:03:09.420> dip<00:03:09.660> switches<00:03:09.930> allow<00:03:10.290> various

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
now these dip switches allow various

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.020 
now these dip switches allow various
different<00:03:11.010> functions<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.579> power<00:03:11.790> supply

various<00:03:45.239> functions<00:03:45.840> from<00:03:46.139> software<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.160> let's

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
various functions from software so let's

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.339 
various functions from software so let's
go<00:03:47.549> ahead<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.910> take<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.540> look<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:48.900> some<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.109> that

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
go ahead and take a look at some of that

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.550 
go ahead and take a look at some of that
now<00:03:50.389> so<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.510> first<00:03:51.720> thing<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.989> need<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.139> do<00:03:52.349> is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
now so the first thing I need to do is

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.409 
now so the first thing I need to do is
properly<00:03:52.980> configure<00:03:53.579> my<00:03:53.760> power<00:03:54.000> supply<00:03:54.389> to

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
properly configure my power supply to

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.619 
properly configure my power supply to
export<00:03:55.079> data<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.470> my<00:03:55.590> pc<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.730> inside<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.419> box

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
export data to my pc so inside the box

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.140 
export data to my pc so inside the box
is<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> USB<00:03:58.470> cable<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> an<00:03:59.489> internal<00:03:59.879> USB

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
is a USB cable this is an internal USB

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360 
is a USB cable this is an internal USB
cable<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.750> connects<00:04:01.169> from<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.099> power

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370

motherboard<00:04:04.799> once<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.699> is<00:04:05.760> done<00:04:05.879> i<00:04:06.209> can

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
motherboard once that is done i can

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.110 
motherboard once that is done i can
utilize<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:07.019> software<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.760> now<00:04:08.910> i'm<00:04:09.060> in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
utilize the software so now i'm in

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.550 
utilize the software so now i'm in
Windows<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.720> let's<00:04:09.900> take<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> look<00:04:10.260> at<00:04:10.379> some<00:04:10.500> of
