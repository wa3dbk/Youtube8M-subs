00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.969
 today to the tango program 22 35 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.460
 minutes 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.099
 it means 5 to 10 minutes of warm up 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.470
 or by 5 to 2 minutes of fighting the 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.840
 end and between the two minister quasars 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.850
 of beautiful country steles if we speak to a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.550
 major led by leila between rowing 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.440
 from his open space and we add 10 15 20 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.030
 according to action per minute per kilometer 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.030
 it is necessary to add 10 seconds 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.899
 you do not see for her 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.320
 go up gradually because without taking 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.350
 of land for parties 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 policies 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.410
 so we saw we sell very powerful 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.329
 and taxes pay this link were 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.159
 dug out cyprus the approximations it's going 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.680
 to depend on days so we can also 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.089
 proud of his feelings in this case it takes 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.720
 is difficult but we are not in 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.460
 show up 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.050
 we can not hold and talk 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.509
 but we can answer questions 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.700
 simple by yes no so great that's it 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.399
 also run by train for reindeer but 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.720
 finally it serves the purpose of what the goal is 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.700
 to condition his body for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.050
 get used to getting tired less quickly 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.280
 go further at higher speed 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.720
 for such benefits if you want 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.070
 really know how to answer lean a 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.509
 little more about what's going on in our 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.310
 body when we do our work 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.200
 muscles during an effort we are 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.970
 will do a duty to produce energy 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.220
 but with that there is also the production 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.740
 from lactic acid to acetic acid in 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 the muscles will cause fatigue 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.659
 and the pain 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.880
 our body is quite capable 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.039
 to eliminate this lactic acid but the art 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.539
 is really given or sciatica is 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.340
 produced faster than we can 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.709
 eliminate it by working at a pace 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.569
 close and that our look at the dedications 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.619
 we work near this threshold and it's 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.060
 so we actually get to 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.580
 condition our body the habit and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 so is own to push this solid 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 it is the purpose of the temporal 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.760
 I learned things is sure seventh 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.709
 crown shows that I learned something 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.740
 thing is that I thought I looked like a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.610
 I would have liked all the ups and downs 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:25.830
 finally ben people seem rather to that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 something what used to be 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250
 management 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.350
 to make cost 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.350
 now compression 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.530
 the table will be very tight it is the most 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.360
 I think it's a bit harder 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.489
 no speedware because there is no 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.319
 rest time encouraged me to the euro 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.560
 supported for a long time of 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.690
 time 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.050
 it is difficult to conduct by themselves against 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.050
 find it very effective as 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.170
 do not forget tomorrow night the channel 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.390
 youtube to leave no video and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.530
 review the previous ones and finish 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.530
 with advocacy
