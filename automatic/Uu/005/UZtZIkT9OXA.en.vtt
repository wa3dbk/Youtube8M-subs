 at the state police and is resumed 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.059
 I started doing this course towards the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 police 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.910

 special day with a series of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.339
 events contrary to friends and remained 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.850
 with these two friends one of the two will have to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.320
 change the car stereo and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.760
 we go down to the garage to change 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.510
 this stars between the car 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.519
 one of them has the same age as me 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 started before the military was finished 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:07.229
 four months of military service and then rgf 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.259
 god police had the brilliant idea of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:17.880
 pull out the order pistol for 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:20.399
 let us see naive I didn't know that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 could run a danger given his 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.840
 incompetence in handling it anyway 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.149
 vol charger of projectiles 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 there was a blow in the barrel I remained a blow 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.450
 in the barrel of the gun that touching the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 trigger 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 this shot was a gun and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.690
 own exam and took me on entering 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.399
 throat 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.700
 coming out behind his back however the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.500
 bullet passing in leaving 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.079
 inside it passed close to the column 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.930
 vertebral caused a compression a 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.190
 level of 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.540
 17 to ceriale serves and from there it started 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.880
 all the first thing I remember 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.240
 you wake up in the hospital 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 I immediately noticed it between my legs and my legs 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.380
 arms 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.230
 then slowly with the passing of days I have 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.420
 began to form in the left arm 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.350
 right arm then begin hands 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 so inside of me he says ok with the piano 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.410
 slowly after that I stayed 2 6 2 months in 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 intensive care 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.500
 however in the legs 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 if mourinho no one to me or read 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 dori said nothing suggested we of 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 go to the heidelberger where this is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.330
 very famous rehabilitation center 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.330
 everything is dead 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 arrival in germany will have been eight o'clock 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.440
 in the evening 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:00.180
 I am received in the hospital and immediately I am 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.500
 they made the primary visit told me 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 Gianluca you will no longer walk 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.990
 there is to think what would have given the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.800
 no lives were wheelchair Squares 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.510
 all night he remembers not sleeping though 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.329
 certain point towards dawn 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.970
 the first the first rays of sun inside of 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.590
 gianluca told me, you were the strength of 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.519

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.349
 will and determination 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.680
 let's try to address this on this one 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.680
 game 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.739
 my life certainly changed because 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.489
 logically I do not hide that anyway 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.489
 of the problems 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.540
 today I give my life because I am 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.110
 happy together with raffaella we do 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.129
 still sport we do what we do 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.129
 go to do 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.510
 a life can be 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.959
 and once I am done, I am also sitting on the 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.959
 wheel chair
