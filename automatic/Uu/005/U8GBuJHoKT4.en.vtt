00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.040 
walk not on tissue with two guys on the
first<00:00:22.619> episode<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> pitch<00:00:24.390> GMAC

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
first episode to see what the pitch GMAC

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.130 
first episode to see what the pitch GMAC
and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> RPG<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.550> these<00:00:27.390> are<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> two

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and the RPG and these are like the two

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
and the RPG and these are like the two
easy<00:00:28.410> snack<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.519> game<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.060> think<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> RPG

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
easy snack on the game I think the RPG

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.130 
easy snack on the game I think the RPG
might<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.439> easier<00:00:31.769> than<00:00:31.920> phase<00:00:32.189> G<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.480> how<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
might be easier than phase G so how to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
might be easier than phase G so how to
do<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:35.090> class<00:00:36.090> setup<00:00:38.360> you'll<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
do it is like class setup you'll need a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.100 
do it is like class setup you'll need a
kg<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.640> only<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:42.030> test<00:00:42.360> finish<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.989> you'll

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
kg you only know test finish and you'll

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
kg you only know test finish and you'll
need<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> spy<00:00:43.620> printer<00:00:44.300> like<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> don't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
need a spy printer like what you don't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.910 
need a spy printer like what you don't
use<00:00:46.050> 5<00:00:46.370> kg<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
use 5 kg and that's it and so what you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000 
use 5 kg and that's it and so what you
want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.250> create<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.090> GL<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> shoot

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
want to do create a GL you want to shoot

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
want to do create a GL you want to shoot
low<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.030> push<00:00:54.270> y<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> same<00:00:55.260> time<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.660> see

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
low and push y at the same time that see

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.250 
low and push y at the same time that see
how<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> switch<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.370> real<00:00:59.550> quick<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
how I switch it real quick and this is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
how I switch it real quick and this is
how<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.500> switches<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
how it switches if you don't like it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.410 
how it switches if you don't like it
so<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.280> slow<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so be like that all slow that you do it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.380 
so be like that all slow that you do it
right<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
right you got it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.890 
right you got it
so<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.689> jump

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so that's how you make it you can jump

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.850 
so that's how you make it you can jump
off<00:01:13.110> spin<00:01:13.650> shoot<00:01:14.159> hit<00:01:14.970> somebody

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
off spin shoot hit somebody

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
off spin shoot hit somebody
so<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.369> how<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.610> Maki<00:01:18.060> its

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so that's pretty much how you Maki its

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.999 
so that's pretty much how you Maki its
RT<00:01:19.560> eggs<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> Y<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.270> Xbox<00:01:21.659> players<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
RT eggs and the Y for Xbox players and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
RT eggs and the Y for Xbox players and
I'm<00:01:23.490> pretty<00:01:23.939> sure<00:01:24.090> your<00:01:24.299> ps3<00:01:24.659> played<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> can

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I'm pretty sure your ps3 played you can

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910 
I'm pretty sure your ps3 played you can
figure<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> how<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> Mac<00:01:28.080> admit<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
figure that out so how to Mac admit it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
figure that out so how to Mac admit it's
kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> thinking<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.060> bit

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
kind of thinking it's a little bit

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.620 
kind of thinking it's a little bit
harder<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.579> advise<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> play<00:01:33.090> call<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.509> do
