00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
was this way up 40 is no I think is like

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.780 
was this way up 40 is no I think is like
that<00:02:09.880> pulleys<00:02:10.880> here<00:02:11.120> right<00:02:12.580> quite<00:02:13.580> difficult

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that pulleys here right quite difficult

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.180 
that pulleys here right quite difficult
first<00:02:14.420> job<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:16.210> release<00:02:17.560> my<00:02:18.560> mistake<00:02:18.950> it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
first job is to release my mistake it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.790 
first job is to release my mistake it
was<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.510> way<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
was like that this is the way up is the

they're very good companies okay then
why<00:07:11.160> I<00:07:11.190> said<00:07:11.430> about<00:07:11.610> the<00:07:11.730> tool<00:07:11.970> you<00:07:12.180> could<00:07:12.390> make

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
why I said about the tool you could make

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.510 
why I said about the tool you could make
do<00:07:12.990> it<00:07:13.050> with<00:07:13.230> the<00:07:13.320> tool<00:07:13.530> which<00:07:13.710> is<00:07:13.860> hard<00:07:14.100> way<00:07:14.280> I

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
do it with the tool which is hard way I

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.680 
do it with the tool which is hard way I
just<00:07:15.240> discovered<00:07:15.810> this<00:07:16.340> this<00:07:17.340> spring<00:07:17.940> unit<00:07:18.510> is

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
just discovered this this spring unit is

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.520 
just discovered this this spring unit is
connected<00:07:19.440> to<00:07:20.120> your<00:07:21.120> nape<00:07:21.420> goes<00:07:21.780> here<00:07:22.110> pushes

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
connected to your nape goes here pushes

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.840 
connected to your nape goes here pushes
it<00:07:22.560> in<00:07:22.830> keeps<00:07:23.760> all<00:07:23.970> in<00:07:24.180> check<00:07:24.480> but<00:07:25.320> if<00:07:26.130> you<00:07:26.310> undo

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
it in keeps all in check but if you undo

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.770 
it in keeps all in check but if you undo
these<00:07:27.030> two<00:07:27.090> no<00:07:27.570> to<00:07:27.990> nuts<00:07:28.940> pop<00:07:29.940> the<00:07:30.120> alternative

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
these two no to nuts pop the alternative

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.240 
these two no to nuts pop the alternative
forward<00:07:31.650> this<00:07:32.550> would<00:07:32.790> naturally<00:07:34.070> this<00:07:35.070> one

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 
forward this would naturally this one

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.470 
forward this would naturally this one
actually<00:07:35.400> come<00:07:35.700> forward<00:07:36.030> and<00:07:36.120> release<00:07:36.300> the

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.480 
actually come forward and release the

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.750 
actually come forward and release the
spring<00:07:36.780> tension<00:07:37.610> so<00:07:38.990> probably<00:07:39.990> easiest<00:07:40.260> by<00:07:40.470> do

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760 
spring tension so probably easiest by do

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.360 
spring tension so probably easiest by do
your<00:07:41.760> nadir<00:07:42.090> wind<00:07:42.510> up<00:07:42.720> about<00:07:42.990> here<00:07:43.770> somewhere

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
your nadir wind up about here somewhere

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.740 
your nadir wind up about here somewhere
so<00:07:44.610> you<00:07:45.540> might<00:07:46.380> still<00:07:46.650> have<00:07:46.800> to<00:07:46.950> undo<00:07:47.280> this

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:47.750 
so you might still have to undo this
