00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
so it's not really that expensive since

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.550

it's been out for such a long time but

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.320 
it's been out for such a long time but
that<00:07:15.070> doesn't<00:07:15.310> really<00:07:15.370> matter<00:07:15.670> to<00:07:15.850> me<00:07:16.890> so<00:07:18.330> this

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
that doesn't really matter to me so this

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.630
