00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
will in my hair journey I'm going to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.120 
will in my hair journey I'm going to
begin<00:01:04.830> heat<00:01:05.670> training<00:01:06.380> for<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> who

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
begin heat training for those of you who

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.870 
begin heat training for those of you who
don't<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.360> heat<00:01:09.659> training<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
don't know what heat training is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
don't know what heat training is
essentially<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.180> purposely<00:01:12.900> giving

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
essentially it's purposely giving

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.609 
essentially it's purposely giving
yourself<00:01:14.340> heat<00:01:14.520> damage<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.320> sounds

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
yourself heat damage I know that sounds

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.760 
yourself heat damage I know that sounds
crazy<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:18.090> hear<00:01:18.240> me<00:01:18.360> out

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
crazy just hear me out

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
crazy just hear me out
so<00:01:19.770> heat<00:01:20.520> training<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.939> basically<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so heat training is basically the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.770 
so heat training is basically the
continuous<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.670> heat<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:26.630> stretch<00:01:27.630> your

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
continuous use of heat to stretch your

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.600 
continuous use of heat to stretch your
hair<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.360> eventually<00:01:31.100> loosen<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.340> curl

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
hair and eventually loosen up your curl

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
hair and eventually loosen up your curl
pattern<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> gradual<00:01:33.869> process

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pattern but it's like a gradual process

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
pattern but it's like a gradual process
it's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.340> something<00:01:35.790> that's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it's not like you know something that's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.609 
it's not like you know something that's
gonna<00:01:36.060> happen<00:01:36.270> overnight<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:38.450> am<00:01:39.470> going<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
gonna happen overnight so I am going on

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.660 
gonna happen overnight so I am going on
a<00:01:40.680> six-month<00:01:41.450> heat<00:01:42.450> training<00:01:42.930> journey<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.399> see

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
a six-month heat training journey to see

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.569 
a six-month heat training journey to see
if<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.750> even<00:01:45.930> work<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
if it if it will even work for me um a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
if it if it will even work for me um a
lot<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> natural<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> heat<00:01:49.409> train<00:01:49.799> because

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
lot of natural is a heat train because

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 
lot of natural is a heat train because
when<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> certain<00:01:52.140> length<00:01:52.530> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
when you get to a certain length your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.580 
when you get to a certain length your
hair<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.509> less

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
hair is much less

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.640 
hair is much less
easier<00:01:57.820> much<00:01:58.820> less<00:01:59.120> easier<00:01:59.540> much<00:02:00.170> less<00:02:00.410> easy

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
easier much less easier much less easy

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.520 
easier much less easier much less easy
it's<00:02:01.610> harder<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.030> manage<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:03.080> much<00:02:03.290> harder

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
it's harder to manage it's much harder

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.840 
it's harder to manage it's much harder
to<00:02:03.650> manage<00:02:03.920> um<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.300> current<00:02:05.630> length

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
to manage um at my current length

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.130 
to manage um at my current length

hair grow it wasn't growing the way that
I<00:03:04.190> was<00:03:04.370> doing<00:03:04.640> things<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> chopped<00:03:05.600> my<00:03:05.750> stuff

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
I was doing things so I chopped my stuff

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.070 
I was doing things so I chopped my stuff
off<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:06.590> grow<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.209> was<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.690> was<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
off so it can grow and it was it was it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.410 
off so it can grow and it was it was it
was<00:03:09.110> doing<00:03:09.410> great<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.610> like<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.940> said<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.239> last

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
was doing great but like I said the last

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.560 
was doing great but like I said the last
year<00:03:12.050> or<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.890> been<00:03:13.190> stagnant<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.360> been

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
year or so it's been stagnant it's been

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.810 
year or so it's been stagnant it's been
between<00:03:14.900> APL<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.920> grazing<00:03:16.250> bra<00:03:16.400> strap<00:03:16.640> not

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
between APL and grazing bra strap not

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.610 
between APL and grazing bra strap not
even<00:03:17.030> full<00:03:17.209> bra<00:03:17.450> strap<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.690> grazing<00:03:18.290> and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
even full bra strap just grazing and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.570 
even full bra strap just grazing and
it's<00:03:19.459> because<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.170> I've<00:03:21.769> known<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.340> and

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's because and I've known this and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.180 
it's because and I've known this and
I've<00:03:23.570> tried<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.290> take<00:03:24.410> measures<00:03:24.769> against<00:03:25.100> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
I've tried to take measures against it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.740 
I've tried to take measures against it
but<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.370> hasn't<00:03:25.489> been<00:03:25.670> working<00:03:25.880> it's<00:03:26.269> because

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
but it hasn't been working it's because

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.840 
but it hasn't been working it's because
at<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.739> rate<00:03:27.769> my<00:03:28.070> hair<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.400> growing<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.790> is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
at the rate my hair is growing it is

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.970 
at the rate my hair is growing it is
