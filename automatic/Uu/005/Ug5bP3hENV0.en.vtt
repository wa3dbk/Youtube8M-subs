00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.399
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.249
 garden world site 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.490
 today we want to talk about this 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:14.870
 interesting plant like lakanus 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.129
 hand he is called phyto pubic and we 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.120
 recycled 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.340
 the carrier should be wide 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.930
 did not receive distribution in gardens 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.220
 because people sing and I know at all 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:35.150
 look at what luxury course is very 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.510
 interesting very so expressive 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:43.130
 brutal I would even say these 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.989
 he brushes inflorescences warehouses 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.700
 very interesting like blackberries 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.180
 the decorativeness of this plant comes 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.920
 that's just the end of summer at the end of August at 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.770
 September when ripen 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:05.079
 here are these berries fruits 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.780
 this is a laconos American he was with us 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:12.300
 delivered somewhere around the seventies 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 years now i'm talking spread 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.610
 very quickly because little about him 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.150
 information actually propagated and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 this plant is very easy to take 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.120
 berries and ripe and simple brothers somewhere 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.070
 free land and slightly cover 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.380
 land and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 Such a podzymny sowing will be very 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 successful also breed sometimes daughters-in-law 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.430
 you later on these berries when they 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.230
 quite warm and here under a bush too 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 find seedlings and then transplant them 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.500
 lakanus is transplanted 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.190
 best at a young age because 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.750
 what does he have 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.700
 taproot such a carrot slightly 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 yellowish orange and matters 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.770
 states he painfully tolerates 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.410
 transplant long it does not build up mass 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.610
 well, and then after all it is restored 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.570
 and takes its 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.570
 this bush here just got sick 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.160
 that is, he came under a very harsh winter 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.820
 snowless winter 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 when our frosts came somewhere in 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.090
 December there was no snow before 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.760
 the end of December only the first year fell 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.970
 snow and this bush here it is under our drink 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.880
 for a long time we did not get out then you still 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:39.450
 rope look as if no he is not 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.380
 suffered diseases this this 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.959
 plant 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.340
 it is actually decorative throughout 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.540
 the whole spring season around the end of May 2 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.480
 is sprouts and they are very very fast 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 begin to grow grow such here ear 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.150
 leaves and already even at this stage still without 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.100
 flowers already bush it pretty 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
 Looks attractive he takes here 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
 it's him in his might 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.900
 this kind of health is practically none 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.780
 eating no no leonid caterpillar nobody a 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.000
 then flowering begins when lacunos 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.790
 about that size 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.550
 somewhere an estimate on it forms white 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.160
 tassels of flowers too he is at this time 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.280
 attractive enough then 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.200
 ripening begins here these inflorescences 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.700
 at first they are green here these berries but already 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.900
 begin to rust the bases themselves 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.460
 these are the same blossoms 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.170
 attractive view or this plant 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.750
 The main question that is asked when 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.030
 see this one 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.390
 edible or these berries exist 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.970
 controversial opinions on this one 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.250
 they say that these berries are poisonous 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.930
 because in general they look like they are 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.560
 some terrible till some 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.220
 mystical they have this kind 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.800
 others say these berries are edible 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.470
 turns right and those and others 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.650
 at home in childbirth 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.890
 or america lakanus grows in warm 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.120
 latitudes and there in the sun on that ground 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.770
 it accumulates toxic substances and 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.590
 evidence that this is now 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.200
 the plant became poisonous 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.170
 when it becomes crimson 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.150
 inflorescences while still so pale 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.600
 green and a little times my friend 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.830
 these plants are completely harmless and their 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.760
 big quantity eats scott there and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 here is a plant growing there 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.550
 literally along the roads and somewhere on 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.090
 wastelands 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.990
 and cattle when they go to Bhutan 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.940
 can greatly cut these tang 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.250
 bushes because that's so juicy 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.010
 greens it is clear that she does not really like 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.650
 and then when they also merge such 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.220
 here are the berries they become poisonous 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.100
 poisonous but we still have in the middle lane 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.990
 here is such a cultivated plant 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.320
 which are provided with loose soil 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.480
 constant watering noticed that the poisonous 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.880
 plant that is contained in the culture 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.030
 they lose their shares you and properties and 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.950
 practically are not and gave three more 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.140
 addition of these berries in a small 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.910
 quantity used in industry 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.010
 even for tinting wines and some 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.520
 compotes and in such a small amount 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.760
 they are not poisonous 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:50.680
 berry eat it nothing like that 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.770
 sweet bitter color 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 rains of some tart just here 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.780
 rather she's sweet sour pussies in them 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.479
 Generally in these berries a few weeks 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.820
 but if you are afraid that your children will start 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.979
 eat these berries well I don't know 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.750
 of course then I just need to plant a 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.240
 if there are no children in the garden 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.860
 Well, please , welcome, and I ask 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:20.620
 also used these berries for 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:23.470
 tinting compote of apples in fear 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.440
 He surprised his friends neighbors 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.440
 such unusual plants finish off
