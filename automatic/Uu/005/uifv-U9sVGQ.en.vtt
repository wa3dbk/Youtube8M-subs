00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
different I'm just going to make it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
different I'm just going to make it
smaller<00:00:35.760> again<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.899> balloons

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
smaller again because I want my balloons

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.430 
smaller again because I want my balloons
to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> tiny<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> cut<00:00:40.230> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to be tiny so I'm just going to cut this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.880 
to be tiny so I'm just going to cut this
so<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.850> total<00:00:42.719> size<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> paper<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so that the total size of the paper is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
so that the total size of the paper is
the<00:00:43.920> size<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> work<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> now

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the size that I want to work with so now

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
the size that I want to work with so now
I<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> quarter<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.120> piece<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I just have a quarter of a piece of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.040 
I just have a quarter of a piece of
paper<00:00:48.629> three<00:00:49.379> layers<00:00:50.629> I'm<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> fold

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
paper three layers I'm going to fold

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.400 
paper three layers I'm going to fold
this<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.410> half<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.829> long<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> draw<00:00:54.480> half

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this in half the long way and draw half

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.779 
this in half the long way and draw half
of<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:56.070> hot-air<00:00:56.430> balloon

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of a hot-air balloon

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
of a hot-air balloon
this<00:00:57.449> will<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:57.780> sure<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.320> final

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this will make sure that my final

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.080 
this will make sure that my final
product<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.600> symmetrical<00:01:01.730> it's<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
product is symmetrical it's just like a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
product is symmetrical it's just like a
question<00:01:03.420> mark<00:01:04.159> curves<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.619> then

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
question mark curves around and then

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
question mark curves around and then
straightens<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.409> then<00:01:10.409> across<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
straightens out and then across the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.149 
straightens out and then across the
bottom

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
bottom

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.219 
bottom
so<00:01:12.759> I'll<00:01:12.880> cut<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.240> out

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.200 

and<00:01:17.740> then<00:01:17.920> I'll<00:01:18.070> have<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.549> look<00:01:18.759> at<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.969> shape

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
and then I'll have a look at the shape

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.959 
and then I'll have a look at the shape
and<00:01:19.450> see<00:01:19.600> what<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.780> think<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.469> can<00:01:21.219> always<00:01:21.520> trim

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
and see what I think I can always trim

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:34.190 
and see what I think I can always trim
it<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.240> little<00:01:22.270> bit<00:01:22.600> if<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.960> don't<00:01:23.229> quite<00:01:23.500> like<00:01:23.560> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 

now<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.430> ruler<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
now I'm going to use my ruler and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.510 
now I'm going to use my ruler and
measure<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.810> length<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> fold<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.040> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
measure the length of the fold and it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
measure the length of the fold and it's
about<00:01:38.700> 11<00:01:39.150> centimeters<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
about 11 centimeters so I'm going to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.969 
about 11 centimeters so I'm going to
mark<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.450> center<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.470> five<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
mark off the center which is five and a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.870 
mark off the center which is five and a
half

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.870 

and<00:01:49.390> I'll<00:01:49.540> do<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.810> same<00:01:49.840> thing<00:01:50.350> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.850> other

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
and I'll do the same thing on the other

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.469 
and I'll do the same thing on the other
color<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.750> paper

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.279

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.479 
the small line that I made this is going
to<00:02:19.510> enable<00:02:19.840> me<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:19.989> slide<00:02:20.470> these<00:02:20.709> two<00:02:20.769> pieces

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
to enable me to slide these two pieces

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.350 
to enable me to slide these two pieces
together<00:02:22.680> inside<00:02:23.680> slitting<00:02:24.400> putting<00:02:25.269> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
together inside slitting putting the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360 
together inside slitting putting the
slits<00:02:25.599> together<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.319> then<00:02:26.650> slipping<00:02:27.130> them

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
slits together and then slipping them

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000 
slits together and then slipping them
together<00:02:27.580> now<00:02:27.910> you'll<00:02:28.239> notice<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.830> is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
together now you'll notice that one is

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.860 
together now you'll notice that one is
sticking<00:02:30.459> up<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.670> bit<00:02:30.849> above<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.269> other<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
sticking up a bit above the other and I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.039 
sticking up a bit above the other and I
don't<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.340> going<00:02:33.640> to

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
don't want that so I'm just going to

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.960 
don't want that so I'm just going to
increase<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.260> length<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.709> one<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> my<00:02:36.310> cuts<00:02:36.579> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
increase the length of one of my cuts a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.170 
increase the length of one of my cuts a
tiny<00:02:37.780> bit<00:02:38.110> about<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:39.010> distance<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.700> just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
tiny bit about the distance that I just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.650 
tiny bit about the distance that I just
saw<00:02:40.630> sticking<00:02:41.530> past<00:02:42.209> I'll<00:02:43.209> load<00:02:43.480> these

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
saw sticking past I'll load these

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.800 
saw sticking past I'll load these
together<00:02:44.049> again<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.819> that's<00:02:45.819> much<00:02:46.120> better<00:02:46.420> I

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
together again and that's much better I

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 
together again and that's much better I
can<00:02:47.319> adjust<00:02:47.799> them<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.459> they're<00:02:48.640> holding

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
can adjust them so that they're holding

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.750 
can adjust them so that they're holding
together<00:02:49.150> nicely<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.160> now<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:51.459> I'm<00:02:51.579> going<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
together nicely so now what I'm going to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.339 
together nicely so now what I'm going to
do<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.299> going<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> glue<00:02:54.420> these<00:02:55.420> two<00:02:55.989> same

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
do is I'm going to glue these two same

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.110 
do is I'm going to glue these two same
colored<00:02:56.739> ones<00:02:57.010> together<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.670> only<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:58.090> one

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
colored ones together but only on one

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.309 
colored ones together but only on one
side<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:59.560> I've<00:02:59.829> folded<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:01.260> all<00:03:02.260> together<00:03:02.829> here

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
side so I've folded it all together here

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.979 
side so I've folded it all together here
and<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:06.549> see<00:03:06.730> how<00:03:06.819> they<00:03:06.970> fit<00:03:07.359> on<00:03:07.389> top<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.870> each

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
and you see how they fit on top of each

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.979 
and you see how they fit on top of each
other<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:10.090> make<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.389> fold<00:03:10.660> stick

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
other and you can make the fold stick

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.640 
other and you can make the fold stick
out<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:11.500> now<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.639> I'm<00:03:12.730> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> do<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.650> I'm

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
out so now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.670 
out so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.829> glue<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.579> one<00:03:15.880> half<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
going to glue just that one half to the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000 
going to glue just that one half to the
same<00:03:17.980> color<00:03:18.370> balloon<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.630> that's<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.709> same

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
same color balloon so that's the same

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.650 
same color balloon so that's the same
color<00:03:21.400> half<00:03:21.730> there<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.489> I'm<00:03:25.000> going<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.329> glue

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
color half there and I'm going to glue

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.650 
color half there and I'm going to glue
it<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.859> way<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.130> lays<00:03:27.310> flat

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.100 

and<00:03:29.780> line<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.860> up<00:03:30.920> perfectly<00:03:31.490> so<00:03:31.880> I'm<00:03:32.870> gluing

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and line it up perfectly so I'm gluing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.520 
and line it up perfectly so I'm gluing
the<00:03:33.260> left<00:03:33.500> side<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.040> left<00:03:34.340> side<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.530> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
the left side to the left side and the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.550 
the left side to the left side and the
folds<00:03:36.980> meet<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.430> middle<00:03:37.960> now<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.020> can<00:03:39.260> see

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
folds meet in the middle now you can see

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.220 
folds meet in the middle now you can see
that<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:40.810> pink<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:42.020> sticking<00:03:42.410> up<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:45.020> other

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
that a pink is sticking up and the other

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.470 
that a pink is sticking up and the other
part<00:03:45.710> of<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.340> purple<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.790> sticking<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.270> and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
part of the purple is sticking up and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.350 
part of the purple is sticking up and
then<00:03:47.630> there's<00:03:47.900> pink<00:03:48.200> again<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:49.520> can<00:03:50.180> add<00:03:50.330> a

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
then there's pink again you can add a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.300 
then there's pink again you can add a
little<00:03:50.660> bit<00:03:50.780> more<00:03:50.960> glue<00:03:51.170> here<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.890> don't<00:03:52.130> have

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
little bit more glue here you don't have

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.760 
little bit more glue here you don't have
to<00:03:52.700> actually<00:03:53.300> I'm<00:03:53.960> not<00:03:54.140> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> do<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.710> my

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
to actually I'm not going to do it on my

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.620 
to actually I'm not going to do it on my
next<00:03:55.190> balloon<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:55.850> if<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.060> wanted<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.390> put<00:03:56.600> a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
next balloon but if you wanted to put a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.070 
next balloon but if you wanted to put a
little<00:03:56.870> bit<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.320> glue<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:59.720> hold<00:03:59.960> the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
little bit of glue there to hold the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.990 
little bit of glue there to hold the
pink<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:01.040> really<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.640> pink<00:04:01.850> is

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
pink you can but really the pink is

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.290 
pink you can but really the pink is
slotted<00:04:02.540> down<00:04:02.870> inside<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.830> purple<00:04:04.300> and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
slotted down inside the purple and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.180 
slotted down inside the purple and
unless<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.690> have<00:04:05.840> little<00:04:06.170> people<00:04:06.680> who<00:04:07.100> are

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
unless you have little people who are

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.550 
unless you have little people who are
going<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.810> messing<00:04:08.810> around<00:04:08.900> with<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.410> on

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
going to be messing around with this on

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.130 
going to be messing around with this on
the<00:04:09.680> wall<00:04:09.860> it's<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.550> stay<00:04:10.700> together

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
the wall it's going to stay together

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.560 
the wall it's going to stay together
it's<00:04:12.140> not<00:04:12.290> going<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> fall<00:04:12.800> apart<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.450> you'll

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
it's not going to fall apart so you'll

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.240 
it's not going to fall apart so you'll
just<00:04:14.720> leave<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.200> against<00:04:15.590> your<00:04:15.710> wall<00:04:15.890> and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
just leave that against your wall and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.290 
just leave that against your wall and
tape<00:04:16.670> it<00:04:16.880> onto<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:18.170> wall<00:04:18.970> for<00:04:19.970> my<00:04:20.090> next

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
tape it onto the wall for my next

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.150 
tape it onto the wall for my next
balloon<00:04:20.510> I'm<00:04:20.840> going<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.230> use<00:04:21.440> yellow<00:04:21.770> and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
balloon I'm going to use yellow and

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.360 
balloon I'm going to use yellow and
orange<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:23.560> again<00:04:24.560> I'm<00:04:24.800> going<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.070> work<00:04:25.220> with

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
orange and again I'm going to work with

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.640 
orange and again I'm going to work with
just<00:04:25.700> 1/4<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.330> piece<00:04:26.510> of<00:04:26.690> paper<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.290> three

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
just 1/4 of a piece of paper and three

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.490 
just 1/4 of a piece of paper and three
layers<00:04:28.600> I'm<00:04:29.600> going<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.810> make<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.170> balloon

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
layers I'm going to make this balloon

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.640 
layers I'm going to make this balloon
smaller<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:32.540> I'm<00:04:32.660> using<00:04:32.870> two<00:04:33.230> pieces<00:04:33.380> of

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
smaller and I'm using two pieces of

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.000 
smaller and I'm using two pieces of
yellow<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.250> one<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.640> orange<00:04:35.800> I've<00:04:36.800> just

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
yellow and one of orange I've just

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.650 
yellow and one of orange I've just
trimmed<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:37.610> down<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:38.120> make<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.420> shape

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
trimmed this down to make the shape

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.420 
trimmed this down to make the shape
nicer<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.290> now<00:04:39.410> I'm<00:04:39.530> marking<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.980> center's

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
nicer and now I'm marking the center's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.780 
nicer and now I'm marking the center's
and<00:04:40.870> I'll<00:04:41.870> slit<00:04:42.140> down<00:04:42.380> from<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.950> top<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
and I'll slit down from the top of the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.720 
and I'll slit down from the top of the
same<00:04:44.060> color<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.770> up<00:04:45.770> from<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.190> bottom<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.580> the

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
same color and up from the bottom of the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.549 
same color and up from the bottom of the
contrasting<00:04:47.240> color<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.280> line<00:04:49.280> them<00:04:49.430> together

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:50.559 
contrasting color and line them together

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:54.269 
contrasting color and line them together
glooming<00:04:51.429> same<00:04:51.819> color<00:04:52.089> -<00:04:52.299> same<00:04:52.539> color<00:04:53.279> and

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
glooming same color - same color and

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.659 
glooming same color - same color and
then<00:04:54.519> unfolding<00:04:55.329> it<00:04:55.419> until<00:04:55.809> I<00:04:55.839> like<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.469> shape

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
then unfolding it until I like the shape

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.619 
then unfolding it until I like the shape
of<00:04:58.939> the<00:04:59.180> dimensions<00:05:00.789> looks<00:05:01.789> nice<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.360> see<00:05:02.599> I

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
of the dimensions looks nice you see I

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:08.080 
of the dimensions looks nice you see I
can<00:05:03.009> you<00:05:04.009> can<00:05:04.159> solve<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:05.469> three<00:05:06.469> layers<00:05:07.090> now

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
can you can solve the three layers now

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.999 
can you can solve the three layers now
I'm<00:05:08.210> going<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.419> make<00:05:08.569> a<00:05:08.599> cloud<00:05:09.080> same<00:05:09.650> idea

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
I'm going to make a cloud same idea

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.749 
I'm going to make a cloud same idea
three<00:05:10.430> sheets<00:05:10.930> fold<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.169> half<00:05:12.520> I'll<00:05:13.520> draw

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
three sheets fold it in half I'll draw

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.540 
three sheets fold it in half I'll draw
an<00:05:13.879> outline<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.629> cloud<00:05:14.979> clouds<00:05:15.979> are<00:05:16.189> very

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
an outline of a cloud clouds are very

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.909 
an outline of a cloud clouds are very
irregular<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.479> don't<00:05:17.840> there's<00:05:18.319> no<00:05:18.469> right<00:05:18.770> or

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
irregular you don't there's no right or

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.969 
irregular you don't there's no right or
wrong<00:05:18.949> way<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.370> do<00:05:19.610> this<00:05:20.169> once<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.349> get<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.680> cut

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
wrong way to do this once you get it cut

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.219 
wrong way to do this once you get it cut
and<00:05:22.219> unfolded<00:05:23.029> you'll<00:05:23.180> be<00:05:23.330> able<00:05:23.419> to<00:05:23.659> decide<00:05:24.020> if

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
and unfolded you'll be able to decide if

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.610 
and unfolded you'll be able to decide if
you<00:05:24.349> like<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.740> shape<00:05:24.949> or<00:05:25.129> not<00:05:29.379> I've<00:05:30.379> just

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
you like the shape or not I've just

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.519 
you like the shape or not I've just
drawn<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> rough<00:05:31.069> idea<00:05:31.490> of<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.669> cloud<00:05:32.409> and<00:05:33.409> I'll

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
drawn a rough idea of a cloud and I'll

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.899 
drawn a rough idea of a cloud and I'll
have<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.710> look<00:05:33.949> at<00:05:34.129> it

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.899 

that's<00:05:39.719> pretty<00:05:39.959> good<00:05:40.429> you<00:05:41.429> don't<00:05:41.520> just<00:05:41.729> make

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
that's pretty good you don't just make

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.589 
that's pretty good you don't just make
it<00:05:42.059> a<00:05:42.119> little<00:05:42.270> bit<00:05:42.539> less<00:05:43.259> oval<00:05:44.449> longer<00:05:45.449> and

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
it a little bit less oval longer and

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.359 
it a little bit less oval longer and
narrower<00:05:45.779> just<00:05:46.169> by<00:05:46.289> making<00:05:46.619> these<00:05:46.800> two<00:05:47.039> bumps

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:47.369 
narrower just by making these two bumps

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:50.119 
narrower just by making these two bumps
a<00:05:47.490> little<00:05:47.849> bit<00:05:48.029> shorter<00:05:48.569> just<00:05:49.499> trim<00:05:49.830> them<00:05:49.979> off

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
a little bit shorter just trim them off

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.869 
a little bit shorter just trim them off
a<00:05:50.189> bit

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.790 

alright<00:05:53.879> let's<00:05:54.059> have<00:05:54.179> a<00:05:54.240> look<00:05:55.759> that's<00:05:56.759> good<00:05:57.800> it

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
alright let's have a look that's good it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.489 
alright let's have a look that's good it
was<00:05:58.949> fine<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.279> other<00:05:59.399> way<00:05:59.580> too

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
was fine the other way too

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.799 
was fine the other way too
clouds<00:06:01.499> are<00:06:01.679> like<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:02.149> so<00:06:03.149> again<00:06:03.449> I'll<00:06:03.599> mark

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:03.809 
clouds are like that so again I'll mark

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:07.159 
clouds are like that so again I'll mark
the<00:06:03.959> center<00:06:04.349> and<00:06:05.039> I'll<00:06:05.849> cut<00:06:06.119> up<00:06:06.300> from<00:06:06.539> one<00:06:06.839> and

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
the center and I'll cut up from one and

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.269 
the center and I'll cut up from one and
down<00:06:07.379> from<00:06:07.679> the<00:06:07.800> other<00:06:09.800> and<00:06:10.800> slide<00:06:11.099> them

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
down from the other and slide them

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.449 
down from the other and slide them
together<00:06:11.490> see<00:06:12.360> if<00:06:12.389> they<00:06:12.629> line<00:06:12.899> up<00:06:13.219> and<00:06:14.219> then

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:14.459 
together see if they line up and then

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:19.269 
together see if they line up and then
glue<00:06:15.050> one<00:06:16.050> edge<00:06:16.319> to<00:06:17.219> my<00:06:17.369> background<00:06:17.669> so

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
glue one edge to my background so

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.850 
glue one edge to my background so
there's<00:06:20.279> my<00:06:20.459> three-dimensional<00:06:21.240> cloud<00:06:21.509> I<00:06:21.929> can

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
there's my three-dimensional cloud I can

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.709 
there's my three-dimensional cloud I can
glue<00:06:23.039> that<00:06:23.189> on<00:06:23.309> the<00:06:23.399> wall<00:06:23.580> with<00:06:23.969> my<00:06:24.179> hot-air

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
glue that on the wall with my hot-air

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.939 
glue that on the wall with my hot-air
balloons<00:06:26.240> and<00:06:27.240> all<00:06:27.419> we<00:06:27.539> need<00:06:27.689> now<00:06:27.749> is<00:06:27.959> baskets

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
balloons and all we need now is baskets

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.399 
balloons and all we need now is baskets
for<00:06:29.129> the<00:06:29.219> balloons<00:06:29.869> these<00:06:30.869> are<00:06:31.080> just<00:06:31.229> going<00:06:31.349> to

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
for the balloons these are just going to

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.679 
for the balloons these are just going to
be<00:06:31.529> one-dimensional<00:06:32.029> rectangles<00:06:33.029> so<00:06:33.569> I'll

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
be one-dimensional rectangles so I'll

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.659 
be one-dimensional rectangles so I'll
just<00:06:33.929> measure<00:06:34.379> along<00:06:35.039> the<00:06:35.219> edge<00:06:35.369> of<00:06:35.550> the

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
just measure along the edge of the

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.179 
just measure along the edge of the
bottom<00:06:36.029> of<00:06:36.179> my<00:06:36.360> balloons<00:06:36.719> so<00:06:37.649> I'll<00:06:37.830> know<00:06:38.009> how

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
bottom of my balloons so I'll know how

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:56.890 
bottom of my balloons so I'll know how
wide<00:06:38.429> to<00:06:38.610> make<00:06:38.639> them<00:06:40.759> then<00:06:41.759> I'll<00:06:41.879> cut<00:06:42.119> them<00:06:42.269> out

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.890 

and<00:06:57.440> that's<00:06:57.650> all<00:06:57.860> there<00:06:57.950> is<00:06:58.010> to<00:06:58.310> it<00:06:58.760> so<00:06:59.660> you<00:06:59.750> can

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
and that's all there is to it so you can

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.280 
and that's all there is to it so you can
use<00:07:00.080> some<00:07:00.550> masking<00:07:01.550> tape<00:07:01.820> to<00:07:02.330> attach<00:07:02.630> these<00:07:03.080> to

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
use some masking tape to attach these to

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.980 
use some masking tape to attach these to
your<00:07:03.440> wall

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
your wall

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.960 
your wall
