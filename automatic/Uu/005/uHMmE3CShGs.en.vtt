00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 I want to see her 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.909
 the truth is that watching the players 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.439
 that is on the pitch 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.439
 we can expect a great match 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.090
 if I look at the stands I see two large 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 hobbies cheering without entry 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.920
 terrifying awarded free kick 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.700
 somewhat rigorous yellow I think he gave the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.290
 player but I do not think that entrance 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.820
 deserve card 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.780
 perhaps the referee wants to assert his 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 authority in the field 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.180
 messi 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.980
 here they have another good possibility 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 robben 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.260
 here we have another good opportunity 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 and found it 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.910
 can send the center again 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.180
 I enter totally untimely indicated shot 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.180
 free 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.420
 ejected by direct red I imagine 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.800
 that your coach will be furious should 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.540
 say that the referee's decision 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.540
 will rise to polemics and you can 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.129
 it has not marked it they left sweeping already 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.239
 have managed to get ahead when just 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.239
 we are in the 10 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.810
 they have advanced in the score 10 me 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.950
 it seems that the coach is not going to 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 like see your team now with the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.220
 score against they have to try 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 score to regulate the match because if 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 things can not go much worse 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.099
 xavi 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.200
 month and here they have another good possibility 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.490
 the shot is aimed the coach does not 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.020
 will thank that way to shoot 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.520
 Undoubtedly, it would have been a 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.050
 magnificent goal is a pity that 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.350
 less will not be able to nod the goal 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.180
 I do not think anyone expected that and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.360
 much less the evil achieved a good 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.360
 chance 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.730
 sneijder has assisted in a goal up to 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.730
 now 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.020
 xavi 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.950
