00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 I 'm back the rhythms and this has 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.440
 welcome you to an extension of the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 inner game is on a channel 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 This time we went for the kit 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.039
 trecker decided and maybe is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.020
 he one and another energy ems freshman 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.210
 hague water is nothing in the quiet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 down there was no gold sword no 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 water bucket no angel and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.869
 Normally, all kids have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 some city equipment but a lot 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 is already my city ​​equipment is the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 Compass is expanded as we are 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 Looks down here and I can see you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 I just demonstrate a right 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.489
 on it completely normal and see the front there 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.370
 is a hunter and still has ten hearts 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 when everything is full and actually in the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 Information really good but I think so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 is still not good and the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.690
 Explanation is actually quite simple 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.489
 because there is a mod names damage 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 Indicator I'll like you one day 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.410
 looks up and that's handy 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 just the trackpad only as a white kit 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
 but it is usually also unnecessary 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 and therefore come there's just pretty 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.530
 listless okay there is any one in front 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 kangaroo there we have to be prepared 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.100
 do and i hate jungle area 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 i said i hate it 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 once go through the new track 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 and there is the kangaroo or the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.400
 scorpions where a bit harm 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.490
 has taken very interesting to know 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.540
 Come and meet me once 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.960
 we get there once ran probably very 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.310
 beautiful 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.020
 halima have so much life gardening 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.549
 scribbled and that's why we have him 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.500
 hit directly 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.710
 clean because it makes me smooth times 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.020
 joy a gold helmet been exchanged 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 Ten blocks away is an incident 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 Of course you have to be very interesting 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.939
 not which grid is or not us 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.649
 seen 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.880
 I thought he was following us 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.329
 apparently we get him pretty much 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 relaxed 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 hello a hitler or hey hey had pointed 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.829
 he believed so much lena estate gives 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.030
 or hot drinks but sitcom 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.170
 armor it is exactly armor or hey what 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.420
 is truth what do you think 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 But the front is there but was 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 So it should not be a problem for you 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.360
 to be us unless it is technical in the pvp 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.530
 not as good as he and his team 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060
 made but 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 we took advantage of the range 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.860
 and he is not so beautiful as we are 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 good and otherwise had them 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.680
 actually no good may have had us 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.600
 so can be quite laid-back but people 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.830
 just dignified with what once 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.060
 would not fall down again would be one 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.850
 that they are all down to you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 Although I flew last cow and dust 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.459
 you can expect the downstairs already 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.430
 you can already see it 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.020
 a kangaroo that is a kangaroo 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.070
 I prefer the regeneration potion 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.269
 with this evil and that is also with him 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.830
 have gotten that otherwise arises 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.300
 he really needs it too 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.340
 skip because he has too little hessen 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 just before talking to you 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.959
 jumping again can looks very nice 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 but good from actually yes where it is 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.980
 already got regeneration stampa 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.550
 was not necessary but well you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.120
 Not everything has been exchanged 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.280
 fallen under 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 or comes my near and yet another 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.190
 kangaroo we have one more 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.030
 We should focus on each generation 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 In my opinion, take advantage of this 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.430
 and it was namely network net in bow 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.959
 my friend no no no boss berlin 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.769
 very nice now 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.910
 we should usually get him 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.269
 is a gold jump on truck again 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.850
 can 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.209
 No, that's a shame that so good 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.870
 script probably gave us the bag for us 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:42.299
 was caught up and that should 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.000
 get in no no no no he's older 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.859
 too bad, but I'll just take that 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.590
 rest anyway I have to say trek 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:53.810
 kate only five of 10 points I just hope 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.810
 Please because so much time and jo jo
