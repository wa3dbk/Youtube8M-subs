this<00:01:45.160> that's<00:01:45.490> quite<00:01:46.240> structural<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:47.200> was

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
this that's quite structural it was

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.760 
this that's quite structural it was
built<00:01:47.910> exactly<00:01:48.910> like<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.170> one-off<00:01:50.170> boat<00:01:50.500> we

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
built exactly like a one-off boat we

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.390 
built exactly like a one-off boat we
stood<00:01:51.040> up<00:01:51.100> frames<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.770> double<00:01:54.040> plank<00:01:54.250> it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
stood up frames and we double plank it

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.219 
stood up frames and we double plank it
with<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.610> mahogany<00:01:54.940> plywood<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.930> then

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
with the mahogany plywood and then

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.290 
with the mahogany plywood and then
fibreglass<00:01:56.770> inside<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.580> out<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:58.030> could<00:01:58.210> have

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
fibreglass inside and out we could have

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.630 
fibreglass inside and out we could have
made<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> float<00:01:58.720> we've<00:01:58.990> cut<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.650> cup<00:02:00.220> holes<00:02:00.430> in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
made a float we've cut the cup holes in

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.030 
made a float we've cut the cup holes in
it<00:02:00.729> for<00:02:00.880> lights<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.450> hatches<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.860> walls

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
it for lights and hatches and the walls

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.029 
it for lights and hatches and the walls
come<00:02:03.369> out<00:02:03.520> for<00:02:03.820> camera<00:02:04.210> access<00:02:04.600> but<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.650> this

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
come out for camera access but this this

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.800 
come out for camera access but this this
could<00:02:06.280> have<00:02:06.369> been<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.610> structural<00:02:07.090> boat<00:02:07.240> we

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
could have been a structural boat we

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.719 
could have been a structural boat we
decided<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.320> we<00:02:08.530> would<00:02:08.710> find<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.700> right

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
decided that we would find the right

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.550 
decided that we would find the right
scale<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.600> build<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.050> as<00:02:11.200> an<00:02:11.290> interior

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
scale and build it as an interior

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280 
scale and build it as an interior
exterior<00:02:12.090> piece<00:02:13.090> but<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> lot<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.080> time

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
exterior piece but a lot of the time

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.830 
great components in the film so the big
challenge<00:02:27.490> was<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.270> give<00:02:28.420> them<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.660> full

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
challenge was to give them a full

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.230 
challenge was to give them a full
structural<00:02:29.440> unit<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.490> could<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.850> everything

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
structural unit that could do everything

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.420 
structural unit that could do everything
they<00:02:31.360> wanted<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.870> was<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:33.130> was<00:02:33.190> kind

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
they wanted and that was that was kind

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.500 
they wanted and that was that was kind
of<00:02:33.490> challenging<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.240> light<00:02:34.420> as

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
of challenging and have it light as

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.990 
of challenging and have it light as
possible<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:35.319> didn't<00:02:35.800> get<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> owl<00:02:36.550> ship

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
possible we didn't get the owl ship

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.480 
possible we didn't get the owl ship
until<00:02:37.890> two<00:02:38.890> weeks<00:02:39.130> before<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.690> flew<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:42.069> we<00:02:42.280> had

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
until two weeks before it flew so we had

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.040 
until two weeks before it flew so we had
to<00:02:42.610> engineer<00:02:43.150> everything<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.930> design

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
to engineer everything and design

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.160 
to engineer everything and design
everything<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.340> an<00:02:45.459> assumed<00:02:45.880> weight

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.860 

the<00:02:51.680> owl's<00:02:51.830> ship<00:02:52.160> weighs<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.850> under<00:02:53.030> 11,000

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the owl's ship weighs just under 11,000

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.490 
the owl's ship weighs just under 11,000
pounds<00:02:53.990> since<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:56.210> it's<00:02:56.900> pretty<00:02:57.140> much<00:02:57.290> at

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
pounds since and it it's pretty much at

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.200 
pounds since and it it's pretty much at
the<00:02:57.590> top<00:02:57.740> end<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.160> what<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.430> particular<00:02:58.730> unit

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
the top end of what this particular unit

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.500 
the top end of what this particular unit
will<00:02:59.330> do<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.440> Waldo<00:03:00.830> which

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
will do and this is a Waldo which

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.730 
will do and this is a Waldo which
geometrically<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> same<00:03:02.990> as<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.560> big

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
geometrically is the same as the big

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.570 
geometrically is the same as the big
gimble<00:03:04.070> over<00:03:04.250> there

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
gimble over there

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.960 
gimble over there
so<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.360> moves<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.870> create<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.970> are

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
so the moves that we create here are

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.690 
so the moves that we create here are
basically<00:03:08.420> repeated<00:03:08.930> over<00:03:09.920> underneath<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
basically repeated over underneath the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.750 
basically repeated over underneath the
I'll<00:03:10.790> show<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.620> trickiest<00:03:13.040> section<00:03:13.550> was

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
I'll show the trickiest section was

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.270 
I'll show the trickiest section was
flying<00:03:14.060> outside<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:14.720> tenement<00:03:15.130> because<00:03:16.130> we

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
flying outside this tenement because we

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.150 
flying outside this tenement because we
only<00:03:16.430> had<00:03:16.700> about<00:03:17.300> three<00:03:17.480> inches<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.200> clearance

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.770 

when<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.250> eyes<00:03:22.400> were<00:03:22.640> facing<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> window<00:03:23.390> we

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
when the eyes were facing the window we

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780 
when the eyes were facing the window we
literally<00:03:24.020> had<00:03:24.260> three<00:03:24.500> inches<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.610> was

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
literally had three inches and that was

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.990 
literally had three inches and that was
all<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> motion<00:03:26.540> base<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.020> we<00:03:27.170> had<00:03:27.380> a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
all on a motion base and if we had a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.850 
all on a motion base and if we had a
something<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.150> gone<00:03:29.360> wrong<00:03:29.770> we<00:03:30.770> would

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
something out of gone wrong we would

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.840 
something out of gone wrong we would
have<00:03:31.040> had<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.550> little<00:03:31.820> bit<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.060> problem<00:03:33.850> when

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
have had a little bit of a problem when

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.670 
have had a little bit of a problem when
I<00:03:34.880> walked<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.810> first<00:03:35.959> time<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.650> just

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I walked in it the first time I was just

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.729 
I walked in it the first time I was just
blown<00:03:37.520> away<00:03:37.900> every<00:03:38.900> time<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.110> sort<00:03:39.410> of<00:03:39.500> get<00:03:39.650> in

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
blown away every time I sort of get in

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.260 
blown away every time I sort of get in

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you know so I needed to sort of go

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.550 
you know so I needed to sort of go
through<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.280> with<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.820> designers<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.720> what

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
through that with the designers and what

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.320 
through that with the designers and what
works<00:03:51.860> what<00:03:52.100> doesn't<00:03:52.160> work<00:03:52.520> what<00:03:52.850> can<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.060> hit

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
works what doesn't work what can I hit

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.280 
works what doesn't work what can I hit
this<00:03:54.140> down<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:55.459> I'll<00:03:56.000> be<00:03:56.150> full<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.600> this<00:03:56.780> yeah

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
this down and I'll be full of this yeah

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.600 
this down and I'll be full of this yeah
cuz<00:03:57.470> then<00:03:57.590> when<00:03:57.709> we<00:03:57.799> go<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.950> Antarctica<00:03:58.160> you're

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
cuz then when we go to Antarctica you're

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.590 
cuz then when we go to Antarctica you're
trying<00:03:58.850> thrust<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.690> you'll<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.620> thrust

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
trying thrust like this you'll be thrust

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.020 
trying thrust like this you'll be thrust
right<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.870> think<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:03.530> right<00:04:03.709> tired<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
right I think so right tired in the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.759 
right I think so right tired in the
Millennium<00:04:05.450> Falcon<00:04:05.480> okay<00:04:06.200> push<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.560> floor

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
Millennium Falcon okay push it floor

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.180 
Millennium Falcon okay push it floor
yeah<00:04:07.250> they<00:04:07.400> do<00:04:07.959> but<00:04:08.959> that's<00:04:09.530> fine<00:04:09.709> they<00:04:10.160> are

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
yeah they do but that's fine they are

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:19.300 
yeah they do but that's fine they are
there<00:04:10.519> there<00:04:17.229> we're<00:04:18.229> dude<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.739> real<00:04:18.950> so

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
there there we're dude this is real so
