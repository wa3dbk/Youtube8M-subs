00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.620
 now i'm screwed 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.540
 I expect 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.520
 released in 2006 the gears of war was the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.700
 first game and show the potential that 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.920
 the xbox 360 hardware offered at the time 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.080
 nine years later the game gets a visual 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 renewed and the mission of proving that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.730
 franchise remains relevant in the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.629
 consoles developed by 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.940
 coalition 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.290
 the title is a total reconstruction of the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.330
 first set in the series 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.059
 in other words, although the structure 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.100
 history are the same as the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.930
 technology present in the game was 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.360
 built from scratch to ensure 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.650
 worthy experience of xbox one 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.320
 but is that enough reason 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.979
 to revisit the universe of gears of 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.229
 war 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.549
 The answer you give to our video 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:00.739
 analysis says the four is in a world 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.140
 apocalyptic post dominated by monsters 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.600
 known as crazy in the skin of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.310
 ex-prisoner marcus fenix the player 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.740
 unite a group of soldiers to try to 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.299
 overcome this threat that is almost 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.970
 ending human life on the planet 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.220
 will be as original game history 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.900
 It does not develop many reasons for 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.579
 war or the past of the characters 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.829
 shown on screen 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.869
 the game follows a structure in which scenes 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.149
 actions are alternated with non-animated 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.399
 interactions, something that is reflected even 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.960
 adventure final moments that contradict 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.509
 should be soon ahead 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.969
 the shallow script offset by 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.609
 fights that you really feel 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.200
 that the crazy ones are a great threat 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.369
 even nine years after its launch 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.619
 original 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.469
 gears of war presents well 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.149
 balanced and with sufficient variety 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.530
 to keep the player in front of the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.869
 television for hours at first 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.179
 edition is simply beautiful and in 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.130
 little resembles the visuals of the original game 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.649
 the scenarios and the characters were 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.200
 totally rebuilt to take away 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.799
 xbox power advantage one doing the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.539
 game 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.759
 one of the most beautiful 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.920
 platform unfortunately 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.690
 developers decided to keep some 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.770
 problems that were present in the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.420
 original title 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.580
 the artificial intelligence of their 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800
 still very poor and the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 coverage system often have to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.700
 help you in walls even when you do not 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.129
 that's what you wanted 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 the advanced age of the game is also 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.670
 evident by its somewhat strange rhythm 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.410
 checkpoints not always 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.750
 are distributed in a good way and there are 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 stretches where the game gets too slow 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 the greatest proof of this is the segment in which 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120
 You have to control a car to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.780
 through the dark areas of a large 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 City 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.849
 multiplayer mode is the main 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.340
 benefited from remastering by running 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.830
 at 60 frames per second the constant 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.080
 battles are very fast and brutal 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.370
 although the 12 strand still looks like a 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.620
 not too strong 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.050
 the confrontations are now quite 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.150
 fun and marked by the use of weapons 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.980
 and tactics quite varied 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.959
 It is no exaggeration to say that for 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.239
 only online teammates deathmatch 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.110
 can guarantee hours and hours more 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.110
 intense fun 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 collective embrace the first gears of 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.720
 war continues an excellent action game 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.150
 even if you have aged in some 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.370
 points the visuals renewed the other 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.650
 half chan help bring the game to 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.420
 the current industry standards and proof 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.760
 franchise still has a lot of power 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.739
 fire 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 the game has some problems of rhythm and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.430
 a simple script 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.200
 even after several sequences and clones the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.150
 game continues to have some of the shootings 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.700
 most fun you can find 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.440
 a videogame 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.350
 remastering is also the gateway to 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.609
 ideal entry for new players 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.560
 mainly because of the fantastic 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.430
 new dubbing accompanying this release 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.840
 the idea 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.840
 I'm sure I'll take this in 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.079
 consideration as now stir up 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.030
 anyway the case is already a fan of the series 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.230
 it's worth revisiting your origins with 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.600
 ultimate version 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.489
 next to all this gears of war de 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.560
 Orient said chan creates good 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.480
 expectations for what's coalition 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.480
 is preparing for gears of war 4
