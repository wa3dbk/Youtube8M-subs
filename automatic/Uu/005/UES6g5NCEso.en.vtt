synthetic hair version and that way I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.620 
synthetic hair version and that way I
mean<00:00:32.279> though<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.730> hard<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> find<00:00:33.450> on

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mean though that was hard to find on

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
mean though that was hard to find on
internet<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.770> cheaper

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
internet I think because it is cheaper

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
internet I think because it is cheaper
people<00:00:35.850> tend<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> probably<00:00:37.050> try<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> buy<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
people tend to probably try to buy that
one<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.879> thought<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one first so that was thought out at a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
one first so that was thought out at a
lot<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> places<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.800> want<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> hit<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
lot of places so I just want to hit and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.420 
lot of places so I just want to hit and
got<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> human<00:00:41.850> hair<00:00:42.149> way<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> came<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
got the human hair way so I came in the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
got the human hair way so I came in the
back<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:45.090> had<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> cardboard<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
back because they had the cardboard and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.880 
back because they had the cardboard and
then<00:00:46.379> everything<00:00:47.309> went<00:00:47.460> bad<00:00:47.730> news<00:00:47.969> tax<00:00:48.390> down

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
then everything went bad news tax down

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.180 
then everything went bad news tax down
so<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> how<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.390> wig<00:00:51.600> looks<00:00:52.190> straight
