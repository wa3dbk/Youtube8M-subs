hello<00:00:14.170> everyone<00:00:14.700> I've<00:00:15.700> been<00:00:15.970> asked<00:00:16.299> to<00:00:16.330> give

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
hello everyone I've been asked to give

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.720 
hello everyone I've been asked to give
you<00:00:16.630> some<00:00:16.869> basic<00:00:17.050> information<00:00:17.410> about<00:00:18.190> bone

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
you some basic information about bone

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.510 
you some basic information about bone
marrow<00:00:19.029> and<00:00:19.300> stem<00:00:19.360> cell<00:00:19.930> transplants<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
marrow and stem cell transplants the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.210 
marrow and stem cell transplants the
procedure<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.510> same<00:00:22.540> for<00:00:23.020> both<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.950> only

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
procedure is the same for both the only

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.490 
procedure is the same for both the only
difference<00:00:24.700> is<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.240> location<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.260> stem

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
difference is the location of the stem

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.680 
difference is the location of the stem
cell<00:00:26.740> harvest<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:27.790> let<00:00:27.939> me<00:00:28.029> explain<00:00:28.420> what<00:00:28.660> that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
cell harvest so let me explain what that

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.560 
cell harvest so let me explain what that
means<00:00:29.080> but<00:00:29.980> first<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.789> need<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.060> understand

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
means but first we need to understand

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.780 
means but first we need to understand
what<00:00:31.810> stem<00:00:32.080> cells<00:00:32.379> are<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.980> how<00:00:33.280> they<00:00:33.460> affect

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
what stem cells are and how they affect

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.460 
what stem cells are and how they affect
our<00:00:33.970> health<00:00:34.500> lights<00:00:35.500> please

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.810 

stem<00:00:41.470> cells<00:00:41.800> are<00:00:42.160> one<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.519> body's

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
stem cells are one of the body's

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.939 
stem cells are one of the body's
greatest<00:00:43.420> superheroes<00:00:44.170> they<00:00:44.650> have<00:00:44.830> the

greatest superheroes they have the

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.979 
greatest superheroes they have the

amazing ability either to divide
themselves<00:00:47.260> indefinitely<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.489> make<00:00:48.640> new<00:00:48.850> stem

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210
