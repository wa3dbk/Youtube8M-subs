00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.680
 hi everyone my name is Artem loved and in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.720
 this video, I'll tell you how to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.660
 groom dyed hair 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.389
 and I will tell the principle itself the principle itself 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 colored hair care 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 many clients dyed my hair 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 in the salon or at home is not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 important try to treat them right away 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 they say well, that's what I hurt me for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.660
 must now treat a little on 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 in fact it is fundamentally wrong and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.880
 the principle here is completely different when you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.970
 dyed your hair for about ten days 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.400
 lasts a period of stabilization period 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.760
 color stabilization is a process when 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.250
 cosmetic pigments are mixed with 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.470
 natural pigments inside the hair and in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.830
 this period it is important to the environment and acidifies ph 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.770
 this is exactly what products for 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.660
 dyed hair 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 so when just dyed your hair and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.870
 here for 10 days you need 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 use shampoo for dyed 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 hair and conditioner for colored hair 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.369
 no care moistening and nutrition 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.929
 nothing is used and when 10 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.270
 days 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.770
 then from this period until the next 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 moment of hair coloring 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.170
 You can already use this shampoo and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 moisturizing mask conditioner for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.329
 moisturizing well various treatments so 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.039
 way it turns out that period 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.170
 stabilize you weathered color 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.119
 maximum entrenched more and more he already 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.219
 not to gain a foothold and now until the next 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.469
 moment will be a month or two you already 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.399
 can use products for 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.159
 dyed hair 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.840
 why not always wash only 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.869
 products for dyed hair here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.139
 many say i multiply my head there 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.079
 shampoo for hair because without 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:52.229
 endlessly page sours it 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.289
 lead to dry skin dry skin 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.950
 the head may be some 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.499
 peeling and of course it is not very 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 good and if you constantly use 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.149
 only moisturizing shampoo it will be 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.260
 bad effect on the result 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.080
 staining 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.030
 will be very quickly washed off the color is not 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.410
 durability will not shine 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.620
 so those who dye their hair in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.990
 bathroom should not be two sets 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 grooming one for dyed hair shampoo 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.300
 the air conditioner is already a mask 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.480
 oil various shampoo and conditioner 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.870
 it is possible to moisten for example this 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.350
 Here is the right such care itself 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 principle 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.660
 care is right and if you have 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.900
 have any questions about this 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.980
