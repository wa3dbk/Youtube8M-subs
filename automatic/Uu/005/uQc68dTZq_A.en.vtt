hey YouTube John here and say we're
gonna<00:00:01.800> be<00:00:01.890> talking<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.250> creatine<00:00:02.610> dude

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
gonna be talking about creatine dude

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510 
gonna be talking about creatine dude
dude<00:00:03.659> bro<00:00:04.080> dude<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:05.100> want<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> talk<00:00:05.490> about

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
dude bro dude you want to talk about

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.930 
dude bro dude you want to talk about
creatine<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.420> know<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.319> stuff<00:00:07.700> it's<00:00:08.700> like<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
creatine I know this stuff it's like the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.879 
creatine I know this stuff it's like the
only<00:00:09.120> legal<00:00:09.389> steroid<00:00:10.019> did<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.440> totally

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
only legal steroid did you totally

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.580 
only legal steroid did you totally
pumped<00:00:11.360> yeah<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.570> buddy<00:00:12.719> started<00:00:13.170> using<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
pumped yeah my buddy started using it

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.740 
pumped yeah my buddy started using it
gained<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.370> three<00:00:14.820> pounds<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.269> muscle<00:00:15.630> in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
gained like three pounds of muscle in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.950 
gained like three pounds of muscle in
the<00:00:15.870> first<00:00:16.170> week<00:00:17.029> but<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.630> don't

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the first week but you know what I don't

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.429 
the first week but you know what I don't
use<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.350> that's<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:19.830> tears<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.340> kidneys

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
use it that's not tears of your kidneys

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.990 
use it that's not tears of your kidneys
believe<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.699> everything<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.789> guy's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
believe it or not everything this guy's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
believe it or not everything this guy's
saying<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.630> wrong<00:00:26.720> okay<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.990> let's<00:00:28.170> talk<00:00:28.199> about

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
saying is wrong okay so let's talk about

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
saying is wrong okay so let's talk about
what<00:00:28.619> creaking<00:00:28.920> actually<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.660> crazy<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what creaking actually is crazy is a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.330 
what creaking actually is crazy is a
naturally<00:00:31.260> occurring<00:00:31.320> substance<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
naturally occurring substance in the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
naturally occurring substance in the
body<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.420> primarily<00:00:33.899> produced<00:00:34.170> by<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
body which is primarily produced by the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
body which is primarily produced by the
liver<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> kidneys<00:00:35.300> or<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
liver and the kidneys or it can be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.170 
liver and the kidneys or it can be
gained<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.200> consuming<00:00:37.920> creatine<00:00:38.670> containing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
gained by consuming creatine containing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.319 
gained by consuming creatine containing
foods<00:00:39.510> such<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.350> fish<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.190> meat<00:00:41.790> basically

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the process for producing crew team goes

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
the process for producing crew team goes
something<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:45.120> amino<00:00:45.390> acids

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
something like this two amino acids

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
something like this two amino acids
arginine<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.559> lysine<00:00:46.770> come<00:00:47.430> together<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
arginine and lysine come together and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
arginine and lysine come together and
are<00:00:47.940> catalyzed<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.600> glycine<00:00:49.230> amino<00:00:49.620> transfer

because<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.660> confusing<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.229> all<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
because that's not confusing at all to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.039 
because that's not confusing at all to
produce<00:01:05.489> creatine<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.540> sure<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> summer

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
produce creatine I'm sure the summer

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.370 
produce creatine I'm sure the summer
you're<00:01:07.229> saying<00:01:07.439> wow<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:08.520> cool<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.380> then

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you're saying wow that's cool and then

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
you're saying wow that's cool and then
again<00:01:10.650> most<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.010> reply<00:01:11.340> saying<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
again most you reply saying that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
again most you reply saying that
synthesis<00:01:12.780> mechanisms<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.619> boring<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.430> hell

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
synthesis mechanisms or boring as hell

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
synthesis mechanisms or boring as hell
and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> creatine<00:01:15.689> actually

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:29.759> analogy<00:01:30.290> think<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> ATP<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.450> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is an analogy think of ATP as the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
this is an analogy think of ATP as the
energy<00:01:33.900> currency<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.500> body<00:01:35.060> now<00:01:36.470> think

energy currency of your body now think
of<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.680> action<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.579> say<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.030> muscle

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

that<00:01:42.060> ATP<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.720> buy<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:44.000> here's<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.149> creatine

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that ATP to buy and here's your creatine

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.249 
that ATP to buy and here's your creatine
comes<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.960> think<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> creatine<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:48.259> something

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
comes in think of creatine is something

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
comes in think of creatine is something
that<00:01:49.350> allows<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.750> use<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.380> ATP<00:01:53.720> towards

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that allows you to use more ATP towards

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
that allows you to use more ATP towards
that<00:01:54.930> purchase<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> help<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that purchase so with the help of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.920 
that purchase so with the help of
creatine<00:01:58.280> you're<00:01:59.280> able<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> buy<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.210> bigger

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
creatine you're able to buy a bigger

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
creatine you're able to buy a bigger
more<00:02:01.829> expensive<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> case<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:05.000> more

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
more expensive and in this case a more
