00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
easy this is to make at home all we're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
easy this is to make at home all we're
doing<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.540> applying<00:00:33.960> salt<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:35.040> fish<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
doing is applying salt to fish that is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.209 
doing is applying salt to fish that is
the<00:00:35.730> base<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.989> entire<00:00:37.290> technique<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the base of this entire technique the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
the base of this entire technique the
salt<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.120> pull<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> moisture

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
salt is going to pull all the moisture

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.709 
salt is going to pull all the moisture
out<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.100> essentially<00:00:41.969> dry<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> fish

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
out and it essentially dry the fish

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.049 
out and it essentially dry the fish
you're<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.739> almost<00:00:43.950> pickling<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> yeah<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you're like almost pickling it yeah it's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.200 
you're like almost pickling it yeah it's
a<00:00:45.180> form<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> pickling<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:47.190> add<00:00:47.370> brown<00:00:47.730> sugar<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a form of pickling we add brown sugar to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.279 
a form of pickling we add brown sugar to
this<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this so that you get a little bit of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
this so that you get a little bit of
sweetness<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.770> well<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> did<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:50.879> salt

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sweetness as well if you did just salt

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.740 
sweetness as well if you did just salt
it<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.020> very<00:00:52.079> harsh<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.100> acidic

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
it would get very harsh kind of acidic

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
it would get very harsh kind of acidic
tannic<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> brown<00:00:56.219> sugar

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tannic you know so the brown sugar

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
tannic you know so the brown sugar
definitely<00:00:56.850> mellows<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> adds

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
definitely mellows that out and it adds

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.849 
definitely mellows that out and it adds
a<00:00:58.680> great<00:00:58.920> color<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.579> adds<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> great<00:00:59.820> flavor

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
a great color and it adds a great flavor
