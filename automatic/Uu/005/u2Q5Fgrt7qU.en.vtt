in a while we're getting that taken care

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.310 
in a while we're getting that taken care
of<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:29.929> week<00:01:30.759> but<00:01:31.780> send<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.899> check<00:01:33.110> engine

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
of this week but send a check engine

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.440 
of this week but send a check engine
light<00:01:33.649> off<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:33.979> course<00:01:36.670> but<00:01:37.670> they<00:01:38.060> cruise<00:01:38.300> is

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
light off of course but they cruise is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.889 
light off of course but they cruise is
pretty<00:01:38.660> quiet<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:40.420> was<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.570> thought<00:01:41.720> it'd<00:01:41.869> be

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
pretty quiet I was I thought it'd be

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.609 
pretty quiet I was I thought it'd be
noisier<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:42.530> here<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.740> thought<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.729> might

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
noisier in here I thought that it might

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.950 
noisier in here I thought that it might
have<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> bit<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:46.119> wind<00:01:47.119> rush<00:01:47.390> or<00:01:47.600> something

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
have a bit of wind rush or something

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.540 
have a bit of wind rush or something
back<00:01:48.710> up<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.979> little<00:01:49.069> bit<00:01:49.220> here<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.369> I'll<00:01:49.490> be

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
back up a little bit here so I'll be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550 
back up a little bit here so I'll be
able<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.729> walk<00:01:49.850> around<00:01:50.149> a<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:50.270> easier

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
able to walk around a little easier

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
able to walk around a little easier
I<00:01:52.649> thought<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:56.479> there'd<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.990> least

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I thought that there'd be a lot at least

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
I thought that there'd be a lot at least
wind<00:01:58.770> noise<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.189> something<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.729> it's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
wind noise or something but it's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
wind noise or something but it's
actually<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.420> quiet<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.590> cup<00:02:01.770> holders

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
actually really quiet the cup holders

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
actually really quiet the cup holders
pop<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.840> let's<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.700> power<00:02:05.700> points

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pop out let's get these power points

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.009 
pop out let's get these power points
right<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.310> they<00:02:08.310> both<00:02:08.520> work<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.780> AC

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
right there that they both work the AC

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.280 
right there that they both work the AC
blows<00:02:10.500> ice<00:02:10.739> cold<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:13.349> horn<00:02:13.560> works<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
blows ice cold and the horn works and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.160 
blows ice cold and the horn works and

you can't even really tell unless you
look<00:02:51.360> at<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.080> even<00:02:52.920> know<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.130> video

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
look at like I even know if this video

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.500 
look at like I even know if this video
be<00:02:53.519> able<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.819> but<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:54.390> around

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
be able to see it but like right around

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870 
be able to see it but like right around
the<00:02:54.750> edge<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.340> see<00:02:56.340> where<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.640> tint

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the edge you can see where the tint

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.580 
the edge you can see where the tint
stops<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.630> don't<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.079> understand<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
stops but I don't really understand the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.890 
stops but I don't really understand the
point<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.859> tuning<00:02:59.130> these<00:02:59.250> windows<00:02:59.519> because

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
point of tuning these windows because

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
point of tuning these windows because
honestly<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.989> can't<00:03:01.260> even<00:03:01.350> tell<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.799> there

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
