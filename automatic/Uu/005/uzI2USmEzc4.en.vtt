I would like to use the in-form so I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.530 
I would like to use the in-form so I
didn't<00:04:05.190> actually<00:04:05.340> use<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.880> particular<00:04:06.209> one

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
didn't actually use this particular one

didn't actually use this particular one
right<00:04:06.750> here<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.230> could<00:04:07.470> quite<00:04:07.709> easily<00:04:07.740> do

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
right here but you could quite easily do

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400 
right here but you could quite easily do
that<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:09.150> would<00:04:09.300> work<00:04:09.510> very<00:04:09.570> well<00:04:10.020> no

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that and it would work very well no

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.170 
that and it would work very well no
doubt<00:04:10.590> about<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.640> use<00:04:12.000> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
doubt about it this is the one I use the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.840 
doubt about it this is the one I use the
in-form<00:04:12.750> 84<00:04:13.709> rated<00:04:14.070> R<00:04:14.190> brick<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.550> brought<00:04:14.730> it

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
right here would cost you around that

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.800
