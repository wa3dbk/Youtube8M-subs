the<00:02:22.269> first<00:02:22.599> step<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.290> relationship<00:02:23.769> anyways

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the first step in a relationship anyways

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.520 
the first step in a relationship anyways
because<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.629> don't<00:02:25.870> really<00:02:25.959> want<00:02:26.439> to<00:02:26.470> go

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
because you don't really want to go

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.860 
because you don't really want to go
looking<00:02:27.189> for<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.459> relationship<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.269> whether

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
looking for a relationship in whether

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.630 
looking for a relationship in whether
it's<00:02:29.079> your<00:02:29.230> weight<00:02:29.440> or<00:02:29.650> something<00:02:30.010> else<00:02:30.190> when

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
it's your weight or something else when

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
you are feeling not good about yourself

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.660 
you are feeling not good about yourself
and<00:02:33.010> like<00:02:33.280> you're<00:02:33.970> kind<00:02:34.629> of<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.010> best<00:02:36.489> you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.240 
that a lot of people are like into the
idea<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.140> I<00:05:03.200> think<00:05:03.290> when<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.890> as<00:05:04.070> long

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
idea of it but I think when you as long

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.190 
idea of it but I think when you as long
as<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.400> recognize<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.270> idea<00:05:05.630> of<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.020> is

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
as you recognize that the idea of it is

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.710 
as you recognize that the idea of it is
different<00:05:06.530> than<00:05:06.800> what<00:05:06.980> like<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.760> actually<00:05:08.540> is

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
different than what like it actually is

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.740 
different than what like it actually is
um<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:10.190> think<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:11.120> know<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.300> don't<00:05:11.480> say

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
um I think that you know I don't say

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.790 
um I think that you know I don't say
there's<00:05:11.900> nothing<00:05:11.990> wrong<00:05:12.290> with<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.560> but<00:05:12.590> it's

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
there's nothing wrong with it but it's

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.409 
there's nothing wrong with it but it's
like<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:13.040> just<00:05:13.190> keep<00:05:13.550> writing<00:05:13.850> yourself<00:05:14.030> like

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
like you just keep writing yourself like

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.510 
like you just keep writing yourself like
it's<00:05:14.630> not<00:05:14.810> what<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.080> looks<00:05:15.169> like<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.979> can

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
it's not what it looks like and I can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.159 
it's not what it looks like and I can
tell<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.940> even<00:05:17.210> from<00:05:17.570> like<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:18.140> know

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
things that come with Fame you know that

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.390 
things that come with Fame you know that
are<00:06:07.610> not<00:06:07.789> so<00:06:08.120> fun<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:09.200> that's<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.039> first<00:06:10.190> thing

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
are not so fun so that's the first thing

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.610 
are not so fun so that's the first thing
and<00:06:10.760> as<00:06:11.150> far<00:06:11.330> as<00:06:11.390> lumping<00:06:11.840> in<00:06:11.960> fame<00:06:12.320> and

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
and as far as lumping in fame and

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.680 
and as far as lumping in fame and
success<00:06:12.740> together<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.669> don't<00:06:14.479> think<00:06:14.510> that

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
success together I don't think that

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.159 
success together I don't think that
that's<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.930> very<00:06:15.110> fair<00:06:15.169> like<00:06:15.770> um<00:06:16.600> not<00:06:17.600> analysis

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
that's a very fair like um not analysis

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.630 
that's a very fair like um not analysis
but<00:06:18.380> like<00:06:18.500> thing<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.860> put<00:06:19.010> together<00:06:19.280> because<00:06:19.550> I

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
but like thing to put together because I

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.790 
but like thing to put together because I
think<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:19.970> they're<00:06:20.390> very<00:06:20.570> very<00:06:21.440> different

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
think that they're very very different

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.469 
think that they're very very different
you<00:06:22.130> probably<00:06:22.520> weren't<00:06:22.760> even<00:06:23.000> mediately<00:06:23.300> fish

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
you probably weren't even mediately fish

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.520 
you probably weren't even mediately fish
like<00:06:23.720> you<00:06:23.810> really<00:06:23.990> don't<00:06:24.169> need<00:06:24.229> to<00:06:24.289> go<00:06:24.380> on<00:06:24.440> a

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
like you really don't need to go on a

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.770 
like you really don't need to go on a
tangent<00:06:24.740> but<00:06:25.340> like<00:06:25.490> being<00:06:25.970> successful<00:06:26.570> is

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
tangent but like being successful is

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.050 
tangent but like being successful is
kind<00:06:27.110> of<00:06:27.200> like<00:06:27.350> whatever<00:06:28.340> you<00:06:28.550> want<00:06:28.789> it<00:06:28.880> to<00:06:28.909> be

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
kind of like whatever you want it to be

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.580 
kind of like whatever you want it to be
you<00:06:29.090> can<00:06:29.330> be<00:06:29.360> successful<00:06:29.630> in<00:06:30.169> many<00:06:30.289> different

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
you can be successful in many different
