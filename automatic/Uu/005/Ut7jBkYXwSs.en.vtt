00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 with facial moisturizer or face cream 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:08.130
 olej day daily complete this is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.059
 for sensitive skin and has the factor of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 30 solar protection and this is a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 version as more thin and elongated 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.880
 there is a classic complete law that is like 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.250
 more squared you can see what it is in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.949
 my routine video of facial care of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 a year ago the only thing I have then 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.080
 good is there would be a year there can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.110
 see the normal version that version for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 skin is for combination skin or fat that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.050
 version has sun protection factor 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 15 and more than anything I decided on this and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.260
 the other try 118 milliliters is nothing more 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 375 milliliters but it calls me a lot 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.989
 attention that has protection factor 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.760
 solar 30 and is for sensitive skin 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.700
 Well, the most important thing is to keep 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.790
 your skin hydrated and I think that as a 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.710
 a facial cream is excellent keeps 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.230
 my skin is very hydrated my skin is mixed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.140
 but more with a tendency to be dry and 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.690
 keeps my dry areas very very very 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 affected and that I really like something 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.410
 also very interesting is that it has 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.090
 sun protection factor of 30 yo 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.270
 I always use sun protection factor 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.390
 I used my sunscreen for the face 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 it's the first thing I wear and I use 50 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.200
 up but if nothing else they will use 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.110
 this if nothing else they will use 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.680
 a single product because they are in a hurry or 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.479
 because they like the idea of using a 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.610
 only product this is excellent because 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.039
 the sun protection factor is 30 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.670
 the fact exceeds 30 for my taste 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.369
 especially where we live in Mexico 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.679
 towards the equator line and so on 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.960
 the sun hits differently in any 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.460
 every part of the world and the minimum that 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.049
 We should bring factor 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.439
 solar protection here in Mexico is the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.209
 30 many people believe that from 15 yo 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.340
 I insist that from 50 up 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.110
 It is always better because they need 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.959
 sunscreen that protects against 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.540
 vvv rays not v there is a baby if your baby 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.180
 that some rays are those that go to the layer 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.700
 external of the face and another is the one that goes to 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.980
 the deepest of the dermis if of the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
 skin that they get and then they are rays 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.180
 that, over time, spots and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.209
 others then protection factor 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.209
 solar 30 is the best that there can be 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.960
 happened in a facial moisturizer for 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.430
 sensitive skin and this is very interesting 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.230
 because of the fact that it is for skin 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.880
 sensitive to me it gives me a lot of tranquility 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.120
 why 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.670
 my skin is not the most sensitive but if it 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.860
 irritates easily especially in the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620
 area around the eyes I always have 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.390
 irritated the eyelids and the part of the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.520
 dark circles then you want to stay for 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.680
 sensitive skin gives me the tranquility of 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.930
 that I can put the cream around 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.880
 my eyes and not have to use any 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.520
 kind of extra cream around 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.830
 my eyes and that I like a lot 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.890
 because they avoid me I feel steps 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.990
 unnecessary if you use a contour 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.600
 of eyes that they like is perfectly 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.210
 well keep using but if you have this 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.160
 kind of problems that usually happen to them 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.230
 that around the eyes or in some 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.660
 area especially they are irritated a lot 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.820
 although not all all all all its 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.430
 face is sensitive this is going to help 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.680
 much to be able to use it even though 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 has sun protection factor does not itch 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.320
 It does not itch, it does not irritate me 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.230
 least I really like that consistency 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.870
 It is not as liquid as other creams 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 fix is ​​more like pasture and it's 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.349
 if it happened to me with the other version of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.360
 olej fulfill that if it is more liquid but 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.560
 once I got in touch with you 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.240
 skin really yes 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.380
 if it melts very very well 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.740
 it does not feel heavy does not feel greasy 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.720
 I think sensitive skin or I think that if 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.020
 can be used by people with mixed skin or 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.260
 fat I think is better for mixed skin 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.850
 or fat the other version that has to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.680
 has or law that I tell them they can 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.580
 see in the in the video a year ago 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.580
 but 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.280
 because it helps more like controlling the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.680
 shine but if your skin is seen and set apart 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.620
 sensitive or is misfortune and also 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.110
 sensitive is I think that will help them 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.909
 much more the once it is absorbed 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.969
 on your skin it no longer looks white but 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.800
 you really need to use very very little 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.409
 because if I know if they realize 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.840
 melted a lot or is that included a bread 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.879
 it covered all my hand is something else 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.400
 fabulous, not pop packaging, you can 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.289
 control so much that if you want you can 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.599
 put nothing else that droplet and ready or 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.180
 you can put a complete one you give the 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.479
 turn and it closes then it's not going to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.310
 have accidents I think this is what 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.250
 who need 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.199
 well, not just like two droplets of 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.819
 this style this is all that 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.550
 they need for their face and their neck 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.890
 so 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.570
 and really the product yields a lot 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.090
 Although it brings less than the other 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.500
 complete cream 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.590
 yes 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.420
 go well give up a lot because I already have 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.500
 quite time using the times 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:33.670
 at least four weeks and it's just going 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:37.180
 seeing otherwise here more or less if 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.190
 a month just goes here then it's a very 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.280
 very good indicator the truth the price 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.430
 is 130 pesos if I'm not wrong with 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.160
 130 Mexican pesos or law is one of the 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.130
 marks that is a bit more face but it is 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.980
 a brand that specializes in care 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.530
 of intense skin and anti-aging factors 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.500
 then for me it's much more worth it 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.300
 olej have a cream that having a 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.909
 cream 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.729
 I do not know meat for example what meats are 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:10.300
 very good but in the long term there 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.650
 better as for example this for my 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.960
 part I hope that this is just them 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.960
 useful from the next video and bay
