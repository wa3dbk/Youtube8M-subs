00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
let's switch to the d/s screen and i'll

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
let's switch to the d/s screen and i'll
tell<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.599> talking<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
tell you what we're talking about so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.320 
tell you what we're talking about so
here's<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.310> example<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:29.970> dust<00:00:30.210> or

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here's the first example we have dust or

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030 
here's the first example we have dust or
against<00:00:30.960> West<00:00:31.140> score<00:00:31.349> now<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> isn't

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
against West score now this isn't

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
against West score now this isn't
necessarily<00:00:32.820> realistic<00:00:33.329> example<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.500> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
necessarily realistic example because in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.780 
necessarily realistic example because in
this<00:00:34.739> situation<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.579> know<00:00:35.760> that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this situation you would know that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
this situation you would know that
Gliscor<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> faster<00:00:36.809> anyway<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.320> Gliscor

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
Gliscor is faster anyway because Gliscor

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.319 
Gliscor is faster anyway because Gliscor
generally<00:00:38.250> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> higher<00:00:38.610> base<00:00:38.820> speed<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
generally has a higher base speed and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.560 
generally has a higher base speed and
usually<00:00:39.899> runs<00:00:40.170> speedy<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.010> sometimes<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.059> this

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
usually runs speedy be sometimes so this

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
usually runs speedy be sometimes so this
is<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> sake<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> example<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:44.370> as

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is just for the sake of example but as

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
is just for the sake of example but as
you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.940> after<00:00:45.180> both<00:00:45.629> pokemon<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> taking

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you can see after both pokemon of taking

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
you can see after both pokemon of taking
damage<00:00:46.710> glist<00:00:47.370> score<00:00:47.550> gains<00:00:47.760> leftovers<00:00:48.329> first

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
damage glist score gains leftovers first

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
damage glist score gains leftovers first
showing<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> indeed<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> faster

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
showing that it is indeed the faster

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
showing that it is indeed the faster
pokemon<00:00:50.760> meaning<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> by<00:00:51.719> using<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
pokemon meaning that by using this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
pokemon meaning that by using this
leftovers<00:00:52.710> trick<00:00:52.949> you'll<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> able<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.760> if

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
leftovers trick you'll be able to see if

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
leftovers trick you'll be able to see if
you're<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.570> speeding<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.110> opponent<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.559> not

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you're out speeding your opponent or not

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
you're out speeding your opponent or not
now<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> second<00:00:57.000> example<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.600> involves

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
now a second example here involves

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
now a second example here involves
garrison<00:00:58.440> arcanine<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.059> about

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
garrison arcanine now this is all about

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
garrison arcanine now this is all about
sand<00:01:00.660> storm<00:01:00.989> damage<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.710> pokin

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
sand storm damage now these two pokin

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
sand storm damage now these two pokin
are<00:01:02.070> both<00:01:02.190> susceptible<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> sandstorm

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
are both susceptible to sandstorm

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
are both susceptible to sandstorm
meaning<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.350> hit<00:01:04.650> we'll<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
meaning that when they get hit we'll be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
meaning that when they get hit we'll be
able<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:05.880> who<00:01:05.939> gets<00:01:06.360> hit<00:01:06.540> first<00:01:06.570> by<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
able to see by who gets hit first by the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
able to see by who gets hit first by the
sandstorm<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.680> Pokemon<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> faster<00:01:08.670> now

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
sandstorm which Pokemon is faster now

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
sandstorm which Pokemon is faster now
this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.200> realistic<00:01:10.710> situation

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
this is a really realistic situation

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.469 
this is a really realistic situation
just<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> sake<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> example<00:01:11.909> again

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
just for the sake of example again

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
just for the sake of example again
dragon<00:01:13.110> dance<00:01:13.320> means<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.010> will<00:01:14.189> be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
dragon dance means that it will be

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.520 
dragon dance means that it will be
faster<00:01:14.760> than<00:01:14.790> our<00:01:15.000> canine<00:01:15.299> anyway<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.320> just

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
faster than our canine anyway but just

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
faster than our canine anyway but just
as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> sandstorm<00:01:17.850> does

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
as you can see when the sandstorm does

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
as you can see when the sandstorm does
eventually<00:01:18.240> hit<00:01:18.630> gyarados<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
eventually hit gyarados you can see that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
eventually hit gyarados you can see that
the<00:01:20.189> damage<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> taken<00:01:21.299> first<00:01:21.509> by<00:01:21.689> garros<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the damage is taken first by garros and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.840 
the damage is taken first by garros and
then<00:01:22.409> by<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.680> canine<00:01:23.009> confirming<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
then by our canine confirming that is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
then by our canine confirming that is
the<00:01:24.030> faster<00:01:24.360> Pokemon<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.200> trick<00:01:25.470> usually

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the faster Pokemon this trick usually

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
the faster Pokemon this trick usually
applies<00:01:26.189> when<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.909> two<00:01:27.090> Pokemon<00:01:27.540> who

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
applies when you have two Pokemon who

you don't know which is faster you don't

and you'll be able to see which of you
is<00:01:39.030> faster<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:40.799> may<00:01:40.950> also<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.280> worth<00:01:41.549> noting

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
is faster it may also be worth noting

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
is faster it may also be worth noting
that<00:01:42.000> status<00:01:42.509> effects<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> hail<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.829> be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that status effects and hail can also be

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
that status effects and hail can also be

used to help this trick for example if

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
used to help this trick for example if
you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.040> poke<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.399> which<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.670> poisoned

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
you have to poke one which are poisoned

you have to poke one which are poisoned
one<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.600> yours<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.140> opponents

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
one is yours well as your opponents

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
one is yours well as your opponents
whoever<00:01:50.159> loses<00:01:50.250> their<00:01:50.700> health<00:01:50.909> first<00:01:51.270> from

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
whoever loses their health first from

whoever loses their health first from
the<00:01:51.509> poison<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> faster<00:01:52.740> Pokemon

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the poison it will be the faster Pokemon

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.920 
the poison it will be the faster Pokemon
and<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.700> observe<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.659> pick<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and if you observe that you can pick it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
and if you observe that you can pick it
up<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.470> hey<00:01:55.649> well<00:01:55.920> he's<00:01:56.070> faster<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
up and think hey well he's faster I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.330 
up and think hey well he's faster I
might<00:01:56.729> switch<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.439> hail<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> exact

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
might switch out now hail is the exact

might switch out now hail is the exact
same<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> sandstorm<00:02:00.329> although<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:00.990> hits

same a sandstorm although it just hits

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.139 
same a sandstorm although it just hits
more<00:02:01.439> Pokemon<00:02:01.920> it'll<00:02:02.399> hit<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> ground<00:02:02.790> type

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
more Pokemon it'll hit the ground type

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.990 
more Pokemon it'll hit the ground type
the<00:02:03.420> rocks<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:04.950> types<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.820> won't

the rocks the other types but it won't

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
the rocks the other types but it won't
hit<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> ice<00:02:06.360> type<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.899> sandstorm<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.530> going

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hit the ice type so sandstorm is going

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.109 
hit the ice type so sandstorm is going
to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.039> best<00:02:08.220> bet<00:02:08.399> there

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to be your best bet there

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.539 
to be your best bet there
but<00:02:09.269> it's<00:02:09.599> probably<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.709> easier<00:02:10.979> way<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
but it's probably a much easier way to

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.910 
but it's probably a much easier way to
find<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.480> fast<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.799> ever
