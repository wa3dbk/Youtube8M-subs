then it's nothing anymore another
something<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> realized<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
something that I realized is that if you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
something that I realized is that if you
delete<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> from<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.600> deletes<00:01:03.960> it

which is good for those type of people

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
which is good for those type of people
that<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:19.020> counting<00:01:19.470> their<00:01:19.590> messages

that want to be counting their messages

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
that want to be counting their messages
so<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.180> over<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.450> bill<00:01:21.810> or

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so that we don't go over there bill or

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
so that we don't go over there bill or
get<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.710> trouble<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> waste<00:01:23.549> too<00:01:23.670> much<00:01:23.790> money

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
get in trouble and waste too much money

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.249 
get in trouble and waste too much money
so<00:01:25.020> basically<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.950> app<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:26.340> cool<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
so basically this app is pretty cool the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
so basically this app is pretty cool the
landscaping<00:01:28.890> goes<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.579> both<00:01:29.700> ways<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.150> way

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
landscaping goes in both ways this way

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.399 
landscaping goes in both ways this way
and<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:32.360> it's<00:01:33.360> great<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.049> only<00:01:34.200> thing<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and that way it's great the only thing I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
and that way it's great the only thing I
don't<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.189> only<00:01:35.220> problems<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.939> with

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
don't like the only problems I have with

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260 
don't like the only problems I have with
this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:37.799> takes<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.030> too<00:01:39.119> much

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
this is that takes up a little too much

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.469 
this is that takes up a little too much
space<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.229> portrait<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
space when you have it in portrait so it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
space when you have it in portrait so it
connects<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.110> keyboard<00:01:43.770> feels<00:01:43.920> smaller

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
connects the keyboard feels smaller

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.969 
connects the keyboard feels smaller
although<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> measured<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
although it's not at all I measured it

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
although it's not at all I measured it
you<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.149> does<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.659> space

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you don't see but it does take up space

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
you don't see but it does take up space
