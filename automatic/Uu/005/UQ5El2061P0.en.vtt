00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hi I'm Daniel and I am bringing you

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi I'm Daniel and I am bringing you
another<00:00:04.410> tune

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
another tune

00:00:05.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
another tune
from<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.580> street<00:00:05.850> organ

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.850 

this<00:01:56.950> organ<00:01:57.400> operates<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.900> crank<00:01:59.260> operates

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
this organ operates the crank operates

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.120 
this organ operates the crank operates
both<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:01.030> bellows<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:02.410> provides<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.980> air

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
both the bellows that provides the air

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
both the bellows that provides the air
for<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.520> pipes<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.590> pulls<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:06.370> paper<00:02:06.760> roll

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
for the pipes and pulls the paper roll

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.940 
for the pipes and pulls the paper roll
through<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:10.300> opens<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:10.960> closes<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
through that that opens and closes the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.340 
through that that opens and closes the
pipes<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.580> didn't<00:02:13.420> explain<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:13.990> well

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
pipes I didn't explain that very well

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.530 
pipes I didn't explain that very well
did<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.220> paper<00:02:15.430> roll<00:02:15.760> operates<00:02:16.210> just<00:02:16.330> like

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
did I the paper roll operates just like

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.630 
did I the paper roll operates just like
a<00:02:16.690> player<00:02:16.990> piano<00:02:17.230> paper<00:02:17.740> roll<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.220> operate

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
a player piano paper roll would operate

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.260 
a player piano paper roll would operate
and<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.600> crank<00:02:20.100> operates<00:02:21.100> both<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.910> bellows

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and the crank operates both the bellows

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.500 
and the crank operates both the bellows
and<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.720> paper<00:02:22.960> roll<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.800> same<00:02:24.040> time

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
and the paper roll at the same time

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.750 
and the paper roll at the same time
which<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.720> why<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.680> has<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:27.130> be<00:02:27.160> turned<00:02:27.490> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
which is why it has to be turned a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.350 
which is why it has to be turned a
little<00:02:28.330> slower<00:02:29.760> towards<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> end<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
little slower towards the end of the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.630 
little slower towards the end of the
roll<00:02:31.570> than<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.800> beginning<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> roll

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
roll than at the beginning of the roll

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
roll than at the beginning of the roll
because<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.290> ratio<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.660> paper<00:02:37.660> travel<00:02:38.350> to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
because of the ratio of paper travel to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.540 
because of the ratio of paper travel to
revolutions<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.410> paper<00:02:41.620> builds<00:02:42.130> up<00:02:42.310> on

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
revolutions as the paper builds up on

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.890 
revolutions as the paper builds up on
the<00:02:43.320> roll<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.040> taking<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.550> paper<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.090> did

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the roll that is taking the paper I did

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.050 
the roll that is taking the paper I did
a<00:02:46.930> lousy<00:02:47.170> job<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.620> explaining<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.700> don't

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
a lousy job of explaining that I don't

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.860 
a lousy job of explaining that I don't
care<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.570> hope<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.960> enjoyed<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> music
