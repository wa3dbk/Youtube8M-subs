 more lively concentrated 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.570
 Unfortunately 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.540
 at the age of 33 exactly ten years 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.870

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.390
 and then the corner started again 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.479
 he does not tolerate anything anymore 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.479

 the record in this moment with joe 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.370
 louis 35 victories give the defeat 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.670
 one the decisive against max 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.670
 schmeling 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:37.440

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.440
 also had respect for the world champion 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 now came a left hook from 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.140
