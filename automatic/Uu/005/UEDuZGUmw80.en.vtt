00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.770
 I have not explained yet 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.700
 or tells tonka that was one 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.469
 toy manufacturer from the usa here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 he is not as well known who was in the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.989
 90s from hasbro bought the beginning 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.309
 the 90s sometime and tonga the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.500
 we specialize in the construction of eg 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.170
 trucks and construction machinery as toys and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.539
 hasbro of course uses now 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.109
 these toys or at this brand 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 and builds so to say yes construction of the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.949
 tangible here is for example one 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 construction machine and sets here for example 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.869
 the lettering lettering sick on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 that just as a short info for you of the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 Furthermore, it is not suitable toys 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.689
 for children under three years we 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 first on tampa a jumper in one 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.040
 cool green here is something else on what 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 blue is behind the eyes that would come 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 maybe ever again at dgx 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 what shape that too here again 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.700
 For example, at buna we know that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.549
 fire truck there it is and so 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 even with the other playlogic 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.310
 This is always so behind toys 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 a form hides the eyes, so to speak 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 is there we'll have a look and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 as a special feature of course in this 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 set the grabber is of course the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.759
 attacks how that works we see here 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.829
 press on it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.640
 there is the little touch when we 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.710
 Release automatically goes again 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.409
 says again really press on it 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 then the greif poor and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.110
 automatically back to what we mean 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.340
 you can do that for example 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.299
 Here , for example, a wall will be here 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 and with the little hand we can do the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.049
 single years stones so to speak gone 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090
 transport or we can also do that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.320
 destroyed wall 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.450
 no idea that we see then in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.890
 next video like that goes for example 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.700
 we can find more in this 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.709
 playing here for example two 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 cans which I think are relative 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.459
 are not typical for the gigs because not 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.370
 in the cinemas but because of the size like 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 are already a bit bigger mostly 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.459
 at the mavericks or at 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.890
 the smaller are the geeks toys 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.730
 we also find only smaller knees 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.990
 cans here in the standard size 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.160
 Let's look back at the page 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.780
 there will be a few more information 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.980
 given as we because this toy 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.750
 you can use them here and they really 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.780
 Very funny from here with the help of 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 jumper we can then also the wall like that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 to say yes shape and I would say 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.370
 we'll pack some now 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.880
 we also have jumpers in the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.560
 in the meantime freed from castro 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.380
 not to the field and what general 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.080
 I'll pack that packs briefly 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.830
 the side so here we jogger times 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.590
 can investigate properly yes as I said 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.049
 very big here too the moving one 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.290
 I find the handles very good 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.200
 but we can play music box here, so to speak 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.280
 really really cool or toss around 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.100
 also grab here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.470
 very cool and then as I said here the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.600
 special feature in the mavericks see what 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510
 we here could speak as one 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.150
 pylone be or what else what does 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 you what is your opinion on what that 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.940
 could be here could be writes 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.940
 that in the comments 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.910
 I'm curious 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.410
 here again as I said the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.480
 Special feature at the garics always behind 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 a form, so to speak, for the eyes 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 hides something very cool here too 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.920
 he can even horst and can be used to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.370
 example, move everything here 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.330
 as I said you can also take out 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.709
 very cool here then for our wall there 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.409
 For example, let's see if we can do that 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.580
 spine a bit 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.600
 Of course you do not see it 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.199
 the house comes, so to speak, and here 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.350
 of course, a vacancy for the 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:29.510
 He also feels very cool about the ride 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.910
 It could almost be a sports car 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.669
 his 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.400
 very nice now, of course, ours 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.010
 knead cans or our play dough 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.010
 Of course we also open it ourselves 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.940
 see here what our wall 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.940
 the brown kneading 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.110
 very cool the typical playbook smell 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:07.290
 I really like it 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:10.080
 yes ok klose 1 or the first kneading like 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.710
 said a lot we will too 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.030
 completely consume and then here the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.400
 second dose 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.340
 It looks really cool with it 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.480
 if we can sparkle for now 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.340
 get out of here 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.560
 which should be actually possible 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:34.070
 Yes, you can see a cool one here 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.070
 glitter effect really really cool 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.450
 I hope you can see it looks very 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.100
 very cool from very chic on the fingers 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:55.850
 also remains a bit of glitter on it 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:59.820
 But it is not so bad and typical 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.850
 play doh feeling kneading feeling one notices 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:07.740
 you have play doh kneeling ok in your hand 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:12.510
 all clear that the second klose and that 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.460
 was the unboxing dredge theme in 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.710
 the next one will follow from this one 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.100
 Of course, the demo build toys here 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.790
 here the wall is together and you are 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.350
 me what this is and I would say 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:30.110
 See you next time 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.110
