00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
then let's go on to the next step okay

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.299 
then let's go on to the next step okay
and<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.170> have<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.500> say<00:00:59.680> you<00:00:59.739> have<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.190> be

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
and I have to say you have to be

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.849 
and I have to say you have to be
jailbroken<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.090> do<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.449> otherwise<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.620> won't

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
jailbroken to do this otherwise it won't

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.500 
jailbroken to do this otherwise it won't
work<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:04.650> I've<00:01:05.650> also<00:01:06.100> just<00:01:06.460> added<00:01:06.730> photos

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.170 
work and I've also just added photos
rather<00:01:08.140> than<00:01:08.530> video<00:01:09.370> because<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> last<00:01:10.000> time

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
rather than video because the last time

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.910 
rather than video because the last time
