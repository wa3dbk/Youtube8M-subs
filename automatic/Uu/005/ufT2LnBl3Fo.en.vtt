scared me there's no more squid why

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.229 
scared me there's no more squid why
don't<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.200> see<00:02:14.350> squid<00:02:14.560> no<00:02:15.130> squid<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.090> what

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
don't I see squid no squid you know what

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.699 
don't I see squid no squid you know what
i<00:02:16.269> think<00:02:16.450> i'll<00:02:16.630> make<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> floating<00:02:17.230> tree<00:02:17.440> farm

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
i think i'll make a floating tree farm

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.199 
i think i'll make a floating tree farm
over<00:02:18.069> there<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> ocean<00:02:18.519> right<00:02:18.819> next<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> my

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
over there in the ocean right next to my

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.930 
over there in the ocean right next to my
spawn<00:02:19.420> makes<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.500> most<00:02:20.650> sense<00:02:20.769> kind<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.819> i

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
spawn makes the most sense kind of i

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.130 
spawn makes the most sense kind of i
don't<00:02:22.060> want<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.330> dig<00:02:22.480> up<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.690> well<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> could

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
don't want to dig up this well I could

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.180 
don't want to dig up this well I could
dig<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.440> sand<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:23.799> then<00:02:23.980> I'd<00:02:24.100> be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
dig out the sand because then I'd be

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.090 
dig out the sand because then I'd be
making<00:02:24.310> glass<00:02:24.670> at<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.000> same<00:02:25.209> time<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.100> maybe

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
making glass at the same time so maybe

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.890 
making glass at the same time so maybe
that's<00:02:27.310> what<00:02:27.459> I'll<00:02:27.549> do<00:02:27.700> I'm<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> dig<00:02:28.750> up

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that's what I'll do I'm going to dig up

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.800 
that's what I'll do I'm going to dig up
all<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.829> sand<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:30.970> replace<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.299> with<00:02:31.480> grass

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
all the sand and replace it with grass

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.289 
all the sand and replace it with grass
and<00:02:32.549> hopefully<00:02:33.549> with<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> grass<00:02:34.120> will

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
and hopefully with all the grass will

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.789 
and hopefully with all the grass will
turn<00:02:34.480> into<00:02:34.570> real<00:02:34.840> grass<00:02:35.109> or<00:02:35.320> whatever<00:02:35.560> am<00:02:35.709> I

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
turn into real grass or whatever am I

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.349 
turn into real grass or whatever am I
sure<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.100> matters<00:02:36.130> for<00:02:36.400> trees<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.970> probably

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
sure if it matters for trees it probably

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.720 
sure if it matters for trees it probably
doesn't<00:02:37.630> should<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.470> lots<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.980> leaves<00:02:39.190> falling

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
doesn't should be lots of leaves falling

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.349 
doesn't should be lots of leaves falling
now<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.500> trees<00:02:41.709> are<00:02:41.920> falling<00:02:42.239> which<00:02:43.239> is

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
now on the trees are falling which is

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.599 
now on the trees are falling which is
something<00:02:43.540> lots<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.989> leaves<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.290> falling

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
something lots of leaves are falling

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.720 
something lots of leaves are falling
lots<00:02:45.609> of<00:02:45.880> leaves<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.450> falling<00:02:46.989> yeah<00:02:47.320> I<00:02:48.250> said

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
lots of leaves a falling yeah I said

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.390 
lots of leaves a falling yeah I said
that<00:02:48.760> I'm<00:02:49.690> also<00:02:49.810> curious<00:02:50.200> when<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.070> use<00:02:51.280> an

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
that I'm also curious when you use an

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.150 
that I'm also curious when you use an
axe<00:02:51.609> on<00:02:51.850> leaves<00:02:52.150> does<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.079> count<00:02:53.230> as<00:02:53.470> cutting

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
axe on leaves does it count as cutting

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.130 
axe on leaves does it count as cutting
down<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> tree<00:02:54.519> or<00:02:55.060> does<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.450> take<00:02:55.570> twice<00:02:56.109> as

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
down a tree or does it take twice as

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.990 
down a tree or does it take twice as
many<00:02:56.380> uses<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.920> cut<00:02:57.070> down<00:02:57.190> through<00:02:57.489> ease<00:02:57.640> I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
many uses to cut down through ease I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.699 
many uses to cut down through ease I
don't<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.810> that's<00:02:59.109> something<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.440> was<00:02:59.560> always

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
don't know that's something I was always

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.229 
don't know that's something I was always
curious<00:02:59.799> about<00:03:00.160> why<00:03:00.579> isn't<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:00.910> falling

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239

that's<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.319> big<00:03:17.470> tree<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.230> use<00:03:20.230> trees<00:03:20.590> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
that's a big tree but it use trees to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.820 
that's a big tree but it use trees to
take<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.340> tree<00:03:21.579> use

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
take the tree use

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.600 
take the tree use
ah<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.810> tree<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.080> way<00:03:25.290> too<00:03:25.350> big<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.860> don't

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
ah this tree is way too big I don't
