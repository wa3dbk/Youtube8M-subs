and<00:00:21.480> then<00:00:21.630> before<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.900> know<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.619> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and then before you know it you have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.470 
and then before you know it you have
designer<00:00:23.279> templates<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.880> over<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> place

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
designer templates all over the place

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.140 
designer templates all over the place
and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:26.099> us<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:27.000> our

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and I know for us that was our

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.269 
and I know for us that was our
experience<00:00:27.349> expecially<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.500> especially

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
experience expecially with especially

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
experience expecially with especially
when<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.580> were<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> Expos<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.140> be

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
when we were at the Expos we would be

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
when we were at the Expos we would be
demoing<00:00:31.619> every<00:00:32.279> five<00:00:32.550> minutes<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:34.050> would

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
demoing every five minutes and we would

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
demoing every five minutes and we would
pull<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.680> different<00:00:34.860> sets<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.910> pull<00:00:36.329> out

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
pull out different sets and we pull out

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
pull out different sets and we pull out
just<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.170> show<00:00:37.200> different<00:00:37.710> customers<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just to show different customers the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.610 
just to show different customers the
different<00:00:38.700> designs<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> do

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
different designs and what they can do

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.799 
different designs and what they can do
with<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> before<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.600> had

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
with them and before we know it we had

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
with them and before we know it we had
templates<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.590> over<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> place<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.940> was

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
templates all over the place and it was

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.720 
templates all over the place and it was
not<00:00:45.239> organized<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.430> did<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
not organized at all so what we did is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
not organized at all so what we did is
we<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.180> came<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> DT<00:00:49.110> working

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
we actually came up with the DT working

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
we actually came up with the DT working
tray<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.489> our<00:00:50.610> solutions<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.329> wandering

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
tray for our solutions for wandering

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.069 
tray for our solutions for wandering
around<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> Expos<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.190> kept<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> sets

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
around the Expos and it kept the sets

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
around the Expos and it kept the sets
separated<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> organized<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> see

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
separated and organized like you can see

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.240 
separated and organized like you can see
here<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.170> found<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.129> got

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
here what we found is that when we got

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.510 
here what we found is that when we got
home<00:00:59.609> we<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.780> miss<00:01:00.989> having<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> tray<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
home we really miss having the tray to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
home we really miss having the tray to
work<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.559> sped<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
work from it really just sped it up the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090 
work from it really just sped it up the
design<00:01:05.610> process<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:06.510> more<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.049> us<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
design process even more for us and so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.289 
design process even more for us and so
what<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> want<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> give<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> close

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
what I want to do is give you a close

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.620 
what I want to do is give you a close
look<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> DT<00:01:10.170> tray<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.090> there

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
look at the DT tray as you can see there

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
look at the DT tray as you can see there
are<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.740> compartments<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
are a lot of different compartments so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
are a lot of different compartments so
you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> different<00:01:16.770> sets

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you can have a lot of different sets

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.240 
you can have a lot of different sets
just<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.729> next<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.240> easy<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> play<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just right next to easy to play with and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
just right next to easy to play with and
you'll<00:01:20.580> notice<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.119> they<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.560> dividers

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you'll notice that they have dividers

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.910 
you'll notice that they have dividers
here<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.330> let<00:01:24.330> me<00:01:24.420> pull<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
here and let me pull this out so you can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.999 
here and let me pull this out so you can
keep<00:01:26.400> these<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:28.049> far<00:01:28.259> apart<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> see

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
keep these this far apart like you see

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
keep these this far apart like you see
here<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.390> dividers<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.140> what

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here now all of these dividers is what

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
here now all of these dividers is what
comes<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> tray<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.689> say<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
comes with the tray but if you say you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.850 
comes with the tray but if you say you
wanted<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:35.810> dividers<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
wanted to have more dividers there is a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.030 
wanted to have more dividers there is a
divider<00:01:38.810> add-on<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:40.829> well

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
divider add-on that you can get as well

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480 
divider add-on that you can get as well
okay<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.500> can't<00:01:43.770> fit<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.369> with

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
okay but you really can't fit just with

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that or even a fun border but it would

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.750

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.580 
so I love it like I said before the fact
that<00:03:44.459> these<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.730> separate<00:03:45.269> allows<00:03:46.140> me<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.440> say

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that these are separate allows me to say

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.080 
that these are separate allows me to say
you<00:03:46.650> know<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.519> some<00:03:47.760> minis<00:03:48.000> into<00:03:48.329> this

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
you know I do want some minis into this

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.750 
you know I do want some minis into this
and<00:03:51.170> then<00:03:52.170> let<00:03:52.530> me<00:03:52.560> go<00:03:52.739> ahead<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.040> try<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
and then let me go ahead and try a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.650 
and then let me go ahead and try a
fotomat<00:03:54.329> here

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.320 

can<00:04:00.660> add<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.020> photo<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.740> one<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.970> let's<00:04:03.150> go

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
can add a photo on this one and let's go

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.130 
can add a photo on this one and let's go
ahead<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.890> map<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.040> other<00:04:05.250> side<00:04:06.080> okay<00:04:07.080> so

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
ahead and map this other side okay so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.210 
ahead and map this other side okay so
that's<00:04:07.380> enough<00:04:07.500> playing

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that's enough playing

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.980 
that's enough playing
it<00:04:08.460> is<00:04:08.640> definitely<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.120> about<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.480> DT<00:04:09.780> tray

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
it is definitely all about the DT tray

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.630 
it is definitely all about the DT tray
but<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.950> really<00:04:11.100> does<00:04:11.220> keep

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
but as you can see it really does keep

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.240 
but as you can see it really does keep
things<00:04:11.880> nicely<00:04:12.150> organized<00:04:12.840> easy<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.770> access

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
things nicely organized easy to access

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.390 
things nicely organized easy to access

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.430 
scrapbooking it is a great working
solution<00:04:28.620> if<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.550> are<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.540> go<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.230> have

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
solution if you are on the go we do have

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.290 
solution if you are on the go we do have
some<00:04:31.620> ideas<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.250> then<00:04:32.640> aren't<00:04:32.910> available<00:04:32.970> yet

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
some ideas and then aren't available yet

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.030 
some ideas and then aren't available yet
but<00:04:33.450> we<00:04:33.720> are<00:04:33.750> working<00:04:33.990> on<00:04:34.230> some<00:04:34.440> solutions<00:04:34.860> as

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
but we are working on some solutions as

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.790 
but we are working on some solutions as
far<00:04:35.070> as<00:04:35.310> storage<00:04:35.490> when<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.270> go<00:04:36.420> places<00:04:36.800> but

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
far as storage when you go places but

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.380 
far as storage when you go places but
you<00:04:37.860> can<00:04:38.100> always<00:04:38.250> even<00:04:38.670> hang<00:04:38.850> them<00:04:39.030> because

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
you can always even hang them because

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.270 
you can always even hang them because
each<00:04:39.600> set<00:04:39.900> does<00:04:40.140> come<00:04:40.290> with<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> ring<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:41.220> you

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
each set does come with the ring so you

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.190 
each set does come with the ring so you
can<00:04:41.370> keep<00:04:41.640> them<00:04:41.790> stored<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:42.540> hanging

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
can keep them stored like this hanging

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.090 
can keep them stored like this hanging
up<00:04:43.970> or<00:04:44.970> if<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.780> want<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.230> do<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.890> all<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.010> time

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
