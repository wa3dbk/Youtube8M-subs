here<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.949> another<00:00:02.220> brain<00:00:02.639> as<00:00:03.859> we<00:00:04.859> blow<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.279> up

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
here is another brain as we blow it up

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.390 
here is another brain as we blow it up
you<00:00:05.879> could<00:00:06.060> quickly<00:00:06.359> see<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.799> many<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
you could quickly see that many of the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.570 
you could quickly see that many of the
blood<00:00:08.760> vessels<00:00:09.269> within<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.809> brain<00:00:10.080> are

blood vessels within the brain are

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.480 
blood vessels within the brain are
severely<00:00:11.580> cuffed<00:00:12.150> by<00:00:12.990> inflammatory<00:00:13.440> cells<00:00:14.219> as

severely cuffed by inflammatory cells as
is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.480> brain<00:00:15.780> substance<00:00:16.289> proper<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.570> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
is the brain substance proper if the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.019 
is the brain substance proper if the
over<00:00:18.900> Lang<00:00:19.140> meninges<00:00:19.770> were<00:00:19.920> also<00:00:20.400> inflamed

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
over Lang meninges were also inflamed

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.769 
over Lang meninges were also inflamed
then<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.109> would<00:00:22.380> legitimately<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.779> deserve

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
then this would legitimately in deserve

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
then this would legitimately in deserve
the<00:00:25.490> anatomic<00:00:26.490> diagnosis<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.570> man<00:00:28.470> enjoy

the anatomic diagnosis of a man enjoy
encephalitis<00:00:30.590> if<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:32.009> look<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.880> cells

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
encephalitis if we look at the cells

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.310 
encephalitis if we look at the cells
which<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.320> inflaming<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.430> brain<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
which are inflaming the brain and the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.130 
which are inflaming the brain and the
blood<00:00:37.320> vessels<00:00:37.800> within<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.340> brain<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> first

blood vessels within the brain the first

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
blood vessels within the brain the first
thing<00:00:40.320> you'll<00:00:40.469> notice<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.640> stain

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
thing you'll notice is that the stain

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.209 
thing you'll notice is that the stain
does<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.930> pink<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.500> usual<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
does not look as pink as usual and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.069 
does not look as pink as usual and
that's<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.450> did<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.430> eosin<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
that's because we did not use eosin and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
that's because we did not use eosin and
hematoxylin<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> usual<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.700> we

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hematoxylin in the usual way on this we

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.590 
hematoxylin in the usual way on this we
stained<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.879> preferentially<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
stained it more preferentially with a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.910 
stained it more preferentially with a
stain<00:00:55.289> called<00:00:55.670> pas<00:00:56.690> which<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> perri<00:00:58.320> otic

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
stain called pas which is perri otic

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.569 
stain called pas which is perri otic
acid<00:00:59.699> shift<00:01:00.210> stain<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.100> sustain

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
acid shift stain because that sustain

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.289 
acid shift stain because that sustain
that<00:01:02.969> stains<00:01:03.680> fungal<00:01:04.680> hyphae<00:01:04.939> very<00:01:05.939> nicely

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that stains fungal hyphae very nicely

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.160 
that stains fungal hyphae very nicely
and<00:01:07.049> notice<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.930> little

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and notice that you see these little

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
and notice that you see these little
rods<00:01:10.590> inside<00:01:12.770> these<00:01:13.770> inflamed<00:01:14.340> areas<00:01:14.850> like

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
rods inside these inflamed areas like

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
rods inside these inflamed areas like
here<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.840> some<00:01:16.500> areas<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.100> appear<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
here in some areas they appear to be

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.780 
here in some areas they appear to be
tangled<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.320> fungal<00:01:19.920> hyphy<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
tangled up these are fungal hyphy and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.530 
tangled up these are fungal hyphy and
technically<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.439> any<00:01:22.680> fungus

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
technically it could be any fungus

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
technically it could be any fungus
sometimes<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> determine<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.759> kind

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
sometimes one way to determine what kind

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
sometimes one way to determine what kind
of<00:01:27.270> fungus<00:01:27.570> would<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.130> if

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
of fungus would be to look to see if

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690 
of fungus would be to look to see if
these<00:01:29.729> phung<00:01:30.119> fungal<00:01:31.110> hyphae<00:01:31.140> branch<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.220> 90

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
these phung fungal hyphae branch at 90

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
these phung fungal hyphae branch at 90
degrees<00:01:32.869> like<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.460> do

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
degrees like they do here and if they do

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
degrees like they do here and if they do
then<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> could<00:01:36.210> limit<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.990> certain

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
then you could limit it to a certain

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.429 
then you could limit it to a certain
numbers<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.299> fungi<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> branch<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.079> 90

infects the brain in patients that are
severely<00:01:52.229> immunocompromised<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> a
