00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.420
 Now I really want to be with 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.330
 you again because today we are going to give 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.119
 a very special thing we are going to give a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.970
 little practical theory for 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.609
 guitarists for everyone who plays 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.410
 good guitar really for all the 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:29.830
 world that plays well there are three ways 1 2 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 3 one two three there are three ways to 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.150
 start a song or song 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.580
 and those three ways, you know it 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.770
 instinctively but now we're going to 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.140
 give it a name because when it comes to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 teach the patterns then then you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 can you tell if it's one of the three 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.850
 ways 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 the first way is that it starts in the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:01.270
 first time 1 21 24 a.m. if you start here 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.220
 it is called that is an ethical principle 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.950
 I'm sorry you have to learn this word 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.260
 synthetic means that it starts in your 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.290
 first time well I'll give an example 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:18.240
 for example of the song yesterday 12 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.240
 12 of spades and this of 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.270
 well that song is from beginning te tico 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.670
 most of the songs and the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.760
 topics begin in the first time 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.170
 then it is normal but the name 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.930
 easy-to-remember aesthetic of cobb 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 very good now let's see it 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.710
 on the board here we have the four 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.030
 times this is the countdown one two 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 three four 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.820
 and listen more not the change of the etcetera 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.259
 then the hymn of aesthetic joy 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.369
 1234 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.390
 pam pam pam pam pam very well now 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.550
 we have the second way to start 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.620
 this is very beautiful this very handsome and it is 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.530
 what all the rockers and all the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.410
 Blues and everything that jazz has 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 to know how to play and know how to 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 call 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.250
 then this starts before the first 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.980
 weather 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 so we have 1 2 3 for dad 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.210
 then it is as if I took breath to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.540
 number 2 the second way to start a 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:48.050
 theme you will have heard the national anthem 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:53.040
 French well it sounds like this dad dad dad 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.330
 dad good the beginning dad is like 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.690
 if I took breath to pompom and it's more 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.590
 dramatic that principle is called anna 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 crosses 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.870
 you have to learn it I'm sorry anna like 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.650
 miss ana and crosses ana crosses if you 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 It's hard to remember what you can 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.569
 imagine that it had once been a 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.989
 beautiful girl very talented and the 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.989
 piano class was called ana su 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.980
 last name was to cross then the anna 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.069
 He crossed himself, so he insisted on going to 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.769
 learn to play the piano and it always came 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.040
 five minutes before to be there 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.700
 before the class began what 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.540
 It seems 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.170
 anna crosses well that is to say here we have 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.800
