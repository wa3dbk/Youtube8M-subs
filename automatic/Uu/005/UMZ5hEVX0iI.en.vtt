00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.939
 good afternoon friends today we will tell 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.390
 to you about a few unusual non-standard 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.150
 use of laboratory power supply in 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.199
 our sample took 2 power 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.070
 rx n 305 d supplied 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.009
 output adjustment options 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.589
 voltage current w and also protection from 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 short circuit and connect 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.759
 reverse polarity let's get that market 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.150
 waste shroud 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.470
 immediately unpack here instructions on 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.600
 English language 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.260
 we will return to it a little later 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.739
 now let's open the power supply 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.230
 To make it easier to open, we recommend 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.260
 this position on the side 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.359
 since it weighs quite a lot 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.449
 pretty on because done by 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:57.600
 transformer carriers here at once we 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:04.829
 show you the bundled goes network 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.829
 block itself remove the packing elements 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.890
 choose this here is a protective shell 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.770
 by the way, as you can see 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.159
 principle you can hold it in one hand 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.340
 so want we will tell tonight 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.209
 look here there are digital indicators 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.369
 and voltage and current regulators now we 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:38.409
 we show you how it all works let's 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:43.390
 connect to the network connects to the network 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.569
 the back of the connector is turned on first 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.709
 but first we say that there is lower 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.599
 the ability to replace yourself 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.879
 power supply unit without any disassembly unit 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.509
 more precisely fuse fuse on 

00:01:52.879 --> 00:02:03.579
 2 amps and so we include here 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:09.319
 let's all 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:11.090
 Use the power button to turn it on and so right 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.880
 voltage indicator 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.560
 left current indicator left why 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.130
 shows us because we have a load 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.549
 not connected load connects 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.829
 minus plus 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.829
 and it is desirable to connect the ground 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:28.849
 grounding if you have a home circuit 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:32.030
 grounding right regulators regulate 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.639
 roughly these left regulators 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.680
 adjusts smoothly how it works 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:41.299
 now we show and now the most important thing 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.359
 what are we going to do this power supply 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.540
 can act as a charger 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.069
 battery devices 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.660
 only a laboratory power supply can 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.370
 charge the battery and at the same time 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.169
 it means that the internal will not be damaged 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.359
 scheme why because there is a mode here 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.750
 voltage stabilization stabilization 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.150
 current 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.849
 why I showed them the battery because 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.480
 that there are a number of parameters that we 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.350
 now install the recommended 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.960
 voltage 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.230
 13 6 13 8 and the maximum current from the studio 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.320
 then even here principle 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.210
 1 and 2 amps let's put it 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.930
 maximum current maximum let's 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.490
 supply 1 amp and 13.8 volts voltage 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
 and also we will use 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.120
 special probes 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.340
 which we also have for sale 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.380
 very convenient principle 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.630
 use and wire 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.690
 but agree with them it is more convenient to want by 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.920
 the reason is that there are crocodiles 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.010
 yusb output and also a number of other conclusions 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.070
 used in various cases 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.030
 so before you connect the probes 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.300
 note the voltage set 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 simpler 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.780
 do not need to connect anything 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.890
 set 13 8 volts how it works smoothly 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.570
 i'm fine adjustment let's set 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:19.850
 here are 13 two and try smoothly with 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.810
 an interval of one tenth will put 13.8 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.350
 volts 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.370
 But the drain pre 1 amp not 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 everything is so simple 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.190
 for this we have to use on 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.750
 practice capabilities of this power supply 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:40.700
 so we insert one year we insert the second 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.320
 conclusion and now see what happens 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.300
 here 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:51.880
 test leads to set current 1 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.540
 amp we need where such an experiment 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.380
 let's see what we have we 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.870
 reduced 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.830
 styli note short mode 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.050
 circuit voltage dropped to near zero 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.540
 short circuit current we can 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.070
 set yourself let's set the current 1 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.970
 ampere which is needed to charge 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:20.040
 battery first group then smoothly 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:23.760
 and now we can proceed to our 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.940
 process and so positive probe 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.830
 we put on + battery minus on 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.810
 minus the battery and see what we have 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.760
 on the screen 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.480
 on the screen we have tension leg dropped 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.130
 the current is literally two hundredths actually 1 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.190
 amperes what will happen next 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.200
 further as the battery current 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.940
 the voltage will fall 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.040
 increases as you can see the power supply 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.820
 perceives mode absolutely normal 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.200
 charge mode power supply 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.930
 stabilizer stabilization mode is included 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.300
 current and this red light comes on 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.730
 the indicator is a grid that block 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.460
 power supply is in stabilization mode 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.280
 current that is, you can leave it so 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.070
 absolutely safe to repeat 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.720
 the current will increase exactly the current will 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.700
 decrease and the voltage will be 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.610
 increase until reach those 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.630
 parameters that are provided for 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:25.030
 this kind of battery since 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:30.090
 power supply capabilities are pretty 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:33.600
 many and not all of you have the opportunity 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.040
 read in English and even more so 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.240
 some instructions are in chinese 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.590
