knitter<00:00:05.720> loom<00:00:06.640> so<00:00:07.640> I'm<00:00:08.000> going<00:00:08.150> to<00:00:08.210> show<00:00:08.450> you

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
knitter loom so I'm going to show you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.720 
knitter loom so I'm going to show you
how<00:00:08.870> you<00:00:08.930> wrap<00:00:09.350> the<00:00:09.650> loom<00:00:09.860> for<00:00:10.100> that<00:00:10.280> I<00:00:10.310> have

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
how you wrap the loom for that I have

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.630 
how you wrap the loom for that I have
the<00:00:10.940> pink<00:00:11.210> nifty<00:00:11.750> knitter<00:00:11.960> here<00:00:12.410> which<00:00:13.220> is<00:00:13.430> the

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
the pink nifty knitter here which is the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.270 
the pink nifty knitter here which is the
smallest<00:00:14.000> of<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.420> long<00:00:14.750> looms<00:00:15.110> I<00:00:15.410> have

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
smallest of the long looms I have

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.930 
smallest of the long looms I have
created<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:17.300> slipknot<00:00:17.660> and<00:00:17.930> secured<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.980> to

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
created a slipknot and secured that to

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.360 
created a slipknot and secured that to
the<00:00:20.240> anchor<00:00:20.660> peg<00:00:20.930> on<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.260> end<00:00:21.680> of<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.920> loom

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
the anchor peg on the end of the loom

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.930 
the anchor peg on the end of the loom
you<00:00:23.030> take<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.690> yarn<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:25.130> make<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.640> loop

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
you take the yarn and you make a loop

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.590 
you take the yarn and you make a loop
around<00:00:26.210> your<00:00:26.810> first<00:00:27.140> peg<00:00:28.000> just<00:00:29.000> like<00:00:29.270> with

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
around your first peg just like with

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.400 
around your first peg just like with
every<00:00:30.140> wrap<00:00:30.650> of<00:00:30.949> a<00:00:31.070> peg<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:31.550> always<00:00:32.060> make<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
every wrap of a peg you always make the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.890 
every wrap of a peg you always make the
top<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.190> cursive<00:00:34.670> ethat<00:00:35.210> you're<00:00:35.360> forming

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
top of the cursive ethat you're forming

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.740 
top of the cursive ethat you're forming
if<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.680> can<00:00:36.890> see<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.370> face<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.000> outside<00:00:38.149> of

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
if you can see that face the outside of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.990 
if you can see that face the outside of
the<00:00:38.870> loom<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.860> should<00:00:40.070> always<00:00:40.220> crisscross

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
the loom and it should always crisscross

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.440 
the loom and it should always crisscross
on<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.420> inside<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.170> loom<00:00:43.060> okay<00:00:44.060> so<00:00:44.120> you're

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
on the inside of the loom okay so you're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.300 
on the inside of the loom okay so you're
going<00:00:44.630> to<00:00:44.690> draw<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.020> yarn<00:00:45.290> across

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.940 

okay<00:00:53.780> now<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> pattern<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.740> you

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
okay now that's the pattern that you

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.850 
okay now that's the pattern that you
make<00:00:56.310> with<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.600> yarn<00:00:57.840> we're<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
make with the with your yarn we're just

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.410 
make with the with your yarn we're just
going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.040> keep<00:00:59.280> doing<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.060> kind<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
going to keep doing that it's kind of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.860 
going to keep doing that it's kind of
hard<00:01:00.720> to<00:01:00.930> explain<00:01:01.080> in<00:01:01.620> words<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> can

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
hard to explain in words but if you can

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.580 
hard to explain in words but if you can
just<00:01:04.050> watch<00:01:04.290> me<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.690> do<00:01:06.690> two<00:01:06.990> pegs<00:01:07.290> on

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
just watch me do this you do two pegs on

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.780 
just watch me do this you do two pegs on
each<00:01:07.890> side<00:01:09.500> before<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.800> back<00:01:11.310> across<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
each side before going back across the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.650 
each side before going back across the
loom<00:01:16.070> because<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.880> pegs<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.420> each

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
loom because you do two pegs on each

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.330 
loom because you do two pegs on each
side<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.229> where<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.130> double

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
side that's where you get your double

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
side that's where you get your double
ribbing<00:01:24.740> okay<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> do

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ribbing okay now what we're going to do

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
ribbing okay now what we're going to do
is<00:01:28.259> we're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.640> once<00:01:29.910> around<00:01:30.119> this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is we're going to go once around this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.100 
is we're going to go once around this
last<00:01:30.720> peg<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.580> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.300> follow<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
last peg and you are going to follow the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.430 
last peg and you are going to follow the
path<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> yarn<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.700> wrap

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
path of the yarn from the first wrap

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.219 
path of the yarn from the first wrap
trace<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.920> across<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> loom<00:01:39.300> just

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
trace it back across the loom just

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.580 
trace it back across the loom just
exactly<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.720> first<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.410> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
exactly like it is the first time you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.960 
exactly like it is the first time you
wrapped<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.920> goal<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.580> get

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
wrapped it so that's your goal is to get

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.950 
wrapped it so that's your goal is to get
the<00:01:48.330> yarn<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.930> match<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.979> exactly<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.720> wrap

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the yarn to match up exactly as you wrap

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
the yarn to match up exactly as you wrap
it<00:01:54.050> in<00:01:55.050> its<00:01:55.289> path<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.920> across<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> loom<00:01:56.819> as

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it in its path back across the loom as

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
it in its path back across the loom as
you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.869> only<00:02:01.080> place<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> yarn

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you can see the only place the yarn

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.450 
you can see the only place the yarn
doesn't<00:02:02.520> match<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.700> exactly<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.710> last

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
doesn't match up exactly is this last

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.499 
doesn't match up exactly is this last
peg<00:02:05.819> which<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> only<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.690> around<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.200> time

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
peg which you only go around one time

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.840 
peg which you only go around one time
and<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.679> tracing<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and I'm just going to keep tracing that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.309 
and I'm just going to keep tracing that
yarn<00:02:12.270> oops<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:14.270> always<00:02:15.270> like<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.510> keep<00:02:15.810> my<00:02:16.020> thumb

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
yarn oops I always like to keep my thumb

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.850 
yarn oops I always like to keep my thumb
right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:17.690> holding<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> yarn<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.260> position

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
right here holding the yarn in position

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.600 
right here holding the yarn in position
so<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.520> miss<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.850> peg<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.709> off<00:02:22.890> track<00:02:23.250> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
so if I miss a peg or get off track it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.520 
so if I miss a peg or get off track it
doesn't<00:02:24.230> come<00:02:25.230> loose<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.800> unravel<00:02:27.290> okay<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
doesn't come loose and unravel okay and

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.589 
doesn't come loose and unravel okay and
Here<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.740> am<00:02:28.860> back<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> beginning

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599
