00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi friends of 4th efe in this video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 we will be giving a brief information 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.450
 about what plasma televisions are 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 lcd and led a greeting for the engineer 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 daniel fields a plasma television is a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.859
 flat screen device 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.189
 commonly used in televisions 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.439
 37 to 70- inch large format also 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.039
 nowadays it is used in televisions 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 of small formats like 22 26 and 32 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 inches a disadvantage of this kind of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 screens in large formats like 42 45 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.100
 50 and up to 70 inches is the high 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 amount of heat emanating what does not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 it's very nice for a user that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 like long hours of television or 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.469
 Video games consists of many cells 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 tiny ones located between two panels of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 crystal containing a mixture of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 noble gases neon and xenon the gas in the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.690
 cells is electrically converted into 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 plasma which causes a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.970
 phosphorescent substance that is not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.610
 phosphorus can emit light 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.320
 characteristics of plasma screens 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.510
 they have a very low level luminance 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 of blacks creating a black that results 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.340
 most desirable to watch movies the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.290
 plasmas use so much energy per meter 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.440
 square like tube TVs 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.420
 cathodic lightning the electrical consumption can 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.790
 vary greatly depending on which 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.460
 the scenes are being seen in the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 bright as a football match 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 they will need more energy than 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.900
 dark scenes like a night scene 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.080
 from a movie 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.899
 nominal measurements indicate 400 watts 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.789
 for a 50-inch screen 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.090
 the relatively recent models 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.490
 consume between 220 and 310 watts for 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 50-inch TVs when you 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.289
 is using in cinema mode the majority 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 of the screens are configured with 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.460
 store mode by default and consume 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 at least twice as much energy as with 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.050
 a more comfortable configuration for 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.210
 home the life time of the last 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.310
 generation of plasma screens is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.800
 estimated at 100,000 hours or 30 years 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 to 8 hours of use per day of real time 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.940
 of viewing however they have 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.010
 produced term televisions 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.020
 that have reduced energy consumption and 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.720
 They have extended the life of the TV 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.790
 in concrete this is the time of life 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.350
 estimated average for the screen the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.150
 moment in which the image has 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.790
 degraded to half its brightness 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.740
 original can still be used but it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.620
 considers the end of functional life 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.510
 of the device the main advantage of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 Plasma technology is that screens 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 very large can be manufactured using 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.230
 extremely thin materials already 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.060
 that each pixel is illuminated 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.070
 individually the image is very 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.640
 bright and has a wide angle 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.610
 view lcd televisions or screen 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.860
 Liquid crystal is a thin screen 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.840
 and flat formed by a number of pixels 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.910
 in color or monochrome we have placed 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 in front of a light source or reflector 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.210
 to characteristics of lcd televisions 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.220
 each pixel of an lcd typically 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.740
 It consists of a layer of molecules 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.760
 aligned between two electrodes 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.190
 transparent and two filters 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.020
 polarization the transmission axes of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.600
 everyone that are in most of the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.130
 perpendicular to each other without 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.450
 liquid crystal between the filter 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.250
 polarizing 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.050
 what happens through the first filter would be 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.160
 blocked by the second crossing 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.590
 polarizer resolution the dimensions 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.590
 horizontal and vertical are expressed in 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.500
 pixels the hd screens have a 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.950
 native resolution from 1280 x 720 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:38.940
 720p pixels up to 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.030
 1080p size the size of an LCD panel 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.019
 it is measured along its diagonal 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.819
 generally expressed in inches 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.180
 colloquially called area of 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.030
 display active response time 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.880
 is the time it takes a pixel in 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.910
 change from one color to another angle 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.579
 vision is the maximum angle at which a 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.769
 user can watch the lcd is being 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.170
 displaced from its center without 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.239
 lose image quality the new 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.660
 screens come with a viewing angle 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.930
 of 178 degrees 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.000
 Input ports have several ports 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.220
 inside like the traditional audio and 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.190
 video also have input from 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.410
 hdmi video the hdmi port has 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.180
 another port vga in which the screen 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.010
 is configured as a monitor and the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.350
 USB port integration for the 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.270
 visualization of photos movies and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.750
 listen to music through a memory 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.090
 Best led led lighting replaces 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.680
 to fluorescent lamps in the new 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.980
 generation of high televisions 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.650
 definition basically a screen 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.680
 'led' either television or monitor is a 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.300
 lcd screen illuminated by leds llc 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.220
 Normal illuminated by tubes 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.520
 fluorescent as its main source 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.320
 of light therefore a TV lade 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.810
 is lit from the back 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.820
 of the panel for at least 1000 leds this 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.000
 Technology presents us with several advantages 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.920
 among which are a television 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.470
 led can handle the tones better 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.300
 dark reaches better levels of 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.750
 black and therefore its contrast 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.060
 considerably increases the LEDs are 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.230
 very small and narrow therefore the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.750
 panel of our 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.220
 and it considerably reduces its size and 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.160
 weight 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.270
 the LEDs have a useful life 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.280
 extraordinarily long with this 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.100
 you make sure that your TV gives you many 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.890
 years of fun the LEDs are more 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.080
 efficient in energy management of 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.020
 in case the televisions and monitors to 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.910
 obvious they have an ecological conscience 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.560
 developed and consume little energy with 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.040
 the use of LEDs in our new 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.600
 models we decrease even more up to 40% 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.380
 the consumption of electricity 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.810
 in short they occupy less space offer 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.910
 a resolution and sharper colors at 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.700
 able to control the brightness of the 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.860
 screen by zones also get 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.900
 reduce energy expenditure around 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.790
 a square we continue with our 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.650
 exhibition on television sets 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.300
 new generation in the world of 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.610
 technology there are several companies 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.710
 dedicated to the development of this between 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.370
 these can find the zombie company 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.770
 live samsung panasonic among others 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.510
 this time we will be giving you more 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.510
 information about the samsung brand
