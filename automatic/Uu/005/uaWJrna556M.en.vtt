play with over the fence so I handed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.650 
play with over the fence so I handed
them<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.220> remote<00:02:08.429> control<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:09.179> played<00:02:09.539> with

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
them the remote control we played with

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.199 
them the remote control we played with
it<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.170> toss<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> include<00:02:10.920> around<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
know enjoy the toy my debt my dad's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.949 
know enjoy the toy my debt my dad's
going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.450> love<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:15.930> dad's<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.530> 57

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
going to love this my dad's you know 57

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.730 
going to love this my dad's you know 57
always<00:02:18.959> won<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> floor<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:19.920> never

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
always won the floor but never

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.680 
always won the floor but never
so<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.770> dragged<00:02:22.190> him<00:02:22.280> out<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:23.000> getting<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.450> desk

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
so I dragged him out is getting the desk

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.170 
so I dragged him out is getting the desk
again<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.840> 845<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:28.550> knew<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.060> my

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
again it's like 845 and I knew in my

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.910 
again it's like 845 and I knew in my
head<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.870> dad<00:02:30.080> keep<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.500> down<00:02:30.650> nice<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
head is just a dad keep it down nice and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.100 
head is just a dad keep it down nice and
low<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.430> if<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.700> lose<00:02:32.060> control<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.720> it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
low so if you lose control of it it's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.730 
low so if you lose control of it it's
recover<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> he's<00:02:35.990> get<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> feel<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
recover but so he's get the feel for it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.970 
recover but so he's get the feel for it
it's<00:02:37.100> kind<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:38.350> slow<00:02:39.350> circle<00:02:39.770> built

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
it's kind of kind of slow circle built

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.760 
it's kind of kind of slow circle built
into<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.290> kind<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.560> if

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
into it so that it just kind of if

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.050 
into it so that it just kind of if
you're<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.160> thinking<00:02:43.550> it'll<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.880> kind<00:02:43.970> of

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you're not thinking it'll just kind of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.720 
you're not thinking it'll just kind of
loop<00:02:44.209> around<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.250> watching<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> single<00:02:46.610> up

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
loop around and watching the single up

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.510 
loop around and watching the single up
and<00:02:47.000> up<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.709> starts<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.280> drift

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
and up and up and it starts to drift

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580 
and up and up and it starts to drift
over<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.150> top<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.540> house<00:02:50.750> towards<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
over the top of the house towards the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.890 
over the top of the house towards the
street<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.850> told<00:02:53.090> my<00:02:53.209> dad<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.420> cut<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
street and I told my dad just cut the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.550 
street and I told my dad just cut the
throng<00:02:54.250> kill<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.340> let<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.700> glide<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.480> dad<00:02:57.260> does

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
throng kill it let it glide and dad does

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.930 
throng kill it let it glide and dad does
trying<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.860> save<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.100> but<00:02:58.280> he<00:02:58.489> hasn't<00:02:58.730> got<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
trying to save it but he hasn't got the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.220 
trying to save it but he hasn't got the
whole<00:02:59.090> reversal<00:02:59.600> thing<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.930> if<00:03:00.110> you're

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
whole reversal thing like if you're

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.780 
whole reversal thing like if you're
looking<00:03:00.500> at<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> airplane<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.489> want<00:03:01.670> to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
looking at the airplane and you want to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.940 
looking at the airplane and you want to
go<00:03:01.940> left<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.330> get<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> steer<00:03:02.720> right<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.830> we'll

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
go left you get a steer right so we'll

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.650 
go left you get a steer right so we'll
go<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:04.190> way<00:03:04.370> or<00:03:05.320> conversely<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:07.420> also<00:03:08.420> when

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
go this way or conversely and also when

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.680 
go this way or conversely and also when
you<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.890> got<00:03:10.100> simple<00:03:10.489> thrust<00:03:10.730> vectoring<00:03:11.090> so

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
you it's got simple thrust vectoring so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.890 
you it's got simple thrust vectoring so
when<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.019> get<00:03:13.010> when<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> turn<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.600> it's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
when you get when you turn it just it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.840 
when you get when you turn it just it's
got<00:03:15.019> two<00:03:15.170> blades<00:03:15.530> two<00:03:16.130> propellers<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.610> ones

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
got two blades two propellers and ones

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.910 
got two blades two propellers and ones
pushing<00:03:17.150> what<00:03:17.450> harder<00:03:18.050> than<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.200> other<00:03:18.350> so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
pushing what harder than the other so

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.970 
pushing what harder than the other so
you<00:03:19.010> start<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.310> lose<00:03:19.430> altitude<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.590> should

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
you start to lose altitude so I should

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.100 
you start to lose altitude so I should
just<00:03:22.100> grab<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.370> promote<00:03:22.640> book<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.810> went<00:03:23.959> out

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
just grab the promote book it went out

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.930 
just grab the promote book it went out
of<00:03:24.170> range<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.910> his<00:03:25.910> rough<00:03:26.600> rustling<00:03:27.320> crash

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
of range and his rough rustling crash

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.370 
of range and his rough rustling crash
and<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.269> must<00:03:29.480> have<00:03:29.600> crashed<00:03:29.810> into<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> trees

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
and you must have crashed into the trees

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.410 
and you must have crashed into the trees
across<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.860> street<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.820> can't<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.299> it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
across the street you can't see it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.670 
across the street you can't see it
you're<00:03:32.570> after<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.930> flashlight<00:03:33.380> digging

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
you're after the flashlight digging

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.420 
you're after the flashlight digging
around

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
around

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.720 
around
maybe<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> same<00:03:35.329> mistake<00:03:35.629> I<00:03:35.750> did<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.670> it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
maybe the same mistake I did and is it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.209 
maybe the same mistake I did and is it
easy<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.329> get<00:03:38.480> excited<00:03:38.840> about<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.989> toy<00:03:39.230> whether

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:40.219 
easy to get excited about a toy whether

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.459 
easy to get excited about a toy whether
you're<00:03:40.459> 24<00:03:42.250> 457<00:03:43.569> but<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:44.659> just<00:03:44.780> funny<00:03:45.019> I'm

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469

you're 24 457 but it's just funny I'm
sure<00:03:45.709> if<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.890> give<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.370> plane<00:03:46.670> 18<00:03:46.909> year<00:03:47.060> old

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
sure if you give the plane 18 year old

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.729 
sure if you give the plane 18 year old
kid<00:03:47.480> or<00:03:47.659> 10<00:03:47.840> year<00:03:47.959> old<00:03:48.079> kid<00:03:48.290> he'd<00:03:48.469> make<00:03:48.620> the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
kid or 10 year old kid he'd make the

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.460 
kid or 10 year old kid he'd make the
same<00:03:48.980> mistake<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.889> yeah

so<00:03:55.330> Earhart's<00:03:56.380> toys<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.800> lot<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.850> fun<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.090> fly<00:03:59.300> if

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
so Earhart's toys a lot of fun to fly if

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.960 
so Earhart's toys a lot of fun to fly if
you<00:04:00.020> go<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.170> spin<00:04:00.500> master<00:04:00.890> calm<00:04:01.370> even<00:04:01.670> have<00:04:01.880> a
