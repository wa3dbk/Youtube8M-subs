00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 and there is everyone his hippo is hoping 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 that you have me well it has very well 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we find ourselves not on 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.280
 black ops two but of course modern 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.559
 warfare 2 I know you are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.349
 a lot of you are very 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 want the mw2 because you will not say 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 not fed up with bo 2 but it's true that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.060
 all the time that bo two bullets to the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.470
 long is a bit boring and I 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.760
 understand of course I understand 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.500
 that's why today we're on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
 a double and two so that 's maybe 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.199
 to be a bit complicated because that makes 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 a moment that I have not touched this game 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 I took it back that game yesterday and it's 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 While bah this is the sniper 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 completely different is not going to be the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 hide so good we'll try to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 do a little bit what we can and then 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.940
 we will especially try to find a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 general melee game because there is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.739
 a lot of fashion on this game so bah 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 listen I I 'm coming back to you when 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.379
 I found a game is good here we are 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 in a game this is the second like 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.680
 in tariff you know how to do because in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 the first one was in a game all 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.129
 was going very well except that I got 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 blow up the mouth at the time 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 obviously present you a video where 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 I 'm totally fucked so we 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.910
 will do what we can of course 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.910
 the guys there 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.770
 a brand a strong tag brand 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.280
 happens to stall there is the spot 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.990
 the spot wah hoon and better everything 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.650
 simply good I still want to 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.030
 specify that I have like two on the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.970
 last tap five movies i think that 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.880
 you saw I created an address or 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.220
 fucking bastard to create an address 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.800
 for the top 5 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.150
 it's top 5 hypo @ or docs.com so I 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.119
 immediately want to clarify we do not 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.650
 do not send me a clip on those on this 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.280
 address just that I do not arrive 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.600
 not to open it so so good I you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 you will not be able to see your 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.340
 clips that continue to send me your 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 play your clips in private message on 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.820
 youtube so how do you have 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.650
 on my channel in the topic about 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.450
 and then sent a message all 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.800
 just not more complicated than that and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.810
 then with a little luck maybe 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.910
 you'll be part of the next top 5 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.440
 tomorrow next friday it takes 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.440
 simply and there is no one 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.670
 hawley with external disk that does good 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.980
 oh la la 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.549
 oh the good thing is to know also that the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.230
 trikes i'm gonna do it 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.299
 is a bit of a disaster in the sense that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.830
 well here before I do not cry that this 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.470
 was not on that I he did days 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.569
 so you do not expect anything 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 of incredible because it did not have 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.209

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.739
 I can but I promise you that I 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.849
 will watch tutorials next time 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.440
 for how to make a little 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.420
 titine to blow things like that I 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.290
 will train me and the next video that 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.790
 you will present will be all the better 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.989
 olÃ© yeah I knew to do some 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.430
 complex stuff because there are times 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.510
 I watch players either on 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.430

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.370
 messaging chat and a unfortunately 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.470

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.690

 video if that's the case do not hesitate to 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.349
 like how to share the video 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.150
 especially at the league and if you want that 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.310
 I continue to make videos on 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.289
 modern warfare 2 since I know it 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.689
 I leave you now 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.430
 with two small ponds heart stops 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.529
 for pr marc I have a reaction a little 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.879
 a little amazing a little equestrian then 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.199
 that yet the markers is not a 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.639
 scene and that's right it was one of 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.710
 my first markers since a very 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.180
 very heavy takes on mw2 and more 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.740
 that's where wall stutters so it's for 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.029
 that a small reaction is the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.169
 second lessor no sound there is that 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.939
 the sound of the game because I was not 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.259
 flirting with my voice it was so 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.520
 for friends have a good day 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.080

00:05:47.820 --> 00:06:00.200
 mark or sense
