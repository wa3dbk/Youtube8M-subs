 it's impressive 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 publish the sharks are on this planet as well 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.449
 decidedly the period 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.449
 those greater than the time of crisis 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.970
 We're going to unite together. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 this is the story of the dinosaurs 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.099
 In fact, sharks change shape and size often to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.819
 changes 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.329
 over 400 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 millions of years 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.110
 there are today 37 species of humble houses twenty-five of God search 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 to get access is a kind of wall 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.170
 together do not even reach 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 the birth of shark species 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 with almost 400 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 if the sale of currency and the border 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.360
 also difficult to mark 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 I ask you to carry them 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.380
 what would happen if the entire human population were concentrated in many places 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 what would it be if all 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.920
 the people of New York decided to be in the same amount on the same night 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.700
 it would be impossible to survive this way 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 that is why the 400 species of shark have spread through the waters of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 all the planet and have adapted to occupy any position of romarinho

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.350
 well cared for by fresh water 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.690
 after you live after living all the water for sure they are by 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.689
 close 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.219
 it is no wonder that many believe that human sharks 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.380
 therefore there are no certainties that few species will bear the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.019
 the biggest job where 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.950
 They all ended up whale for example. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.950
 feeds exclusively on duty 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.310
 these are more of me 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.679
 predators are designed to hunt alone

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.009
 your vision is very developed

 its Chilean periodic aerodynamic format with great speed and 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.549

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.529
 most persistent names in history 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.659
 I'm happy with what you'd resist if you shrink 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.669
 what would you do if from tomorrow the food destination available by 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.019
 long long time 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.569
 much more than neymar open patrolling important is that we are 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.999
 always in search of an opportunity 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.540
 they must so because after being released 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.000
 they know it will take a week a judge to eat again sometimes

 the answer is very simple 5 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.939
 the quantity of salt quality the sharks are many 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.369
 after this 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.230
 the partners 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.219
 others prefer to walk in groups 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.929
 altogether seven other incredibly individualistic companions 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.239
 but all have something in common do not want to be disturbed per month 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.859
 psp is precisely one of the most frequent causes of its attacks on beings 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.769
 humans 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.739
 I need to be careful since we are really terrible but not to the point of 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.739
 promote your public act 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:16.150
 I invite 172 attacks to people around the world with 63 fatalities without more 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.199
 he still remembered his brother. 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 it can not be denied that this happens but generally attacks

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.050
 it's not the reason 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 the confusion 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.569
 tracks down the bathers especially if they are infected 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.860
 those of always this precious animal have been annulled 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.270
 but never in such a way 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.379
 indiscriminate as in the present day 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.289
 there are already seven extinct species 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.319
 but what is the reason for this killing? 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.289
 her fins she got to do said 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.289

 investnews 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 we must treat them with respect that we deserve 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.530
 that there are human resources that special bidding features 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.229
 will be the sharks as always the same level we experienced one of them 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.009
 are close by
