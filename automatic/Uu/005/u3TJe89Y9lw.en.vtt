upgrade<00:00:04.620> i<00:00:04.650> would<00:00:04.859> guess<00:00:05.069> um<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.930> um

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
upgrade i would guess um this is um

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.060 
upgrade i would guess um this is um
regarding<00:00:08.790> different<00:00:09.389> kinds<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.080> timing<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
regarding different kinds of timing and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.640 
regarding different kinds of timing and
different<00:00:11.969> kinds<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:13.820> would<00:00:14.820> say<00:00:15.650> firing

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
different kinds of i would say firing

different kinds of i would say firing
rate<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.779> dispenser<00:00:18.779> our<00:00:19.320> shooter<00:00:19.949> things

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
rate for dispenser our shooter things

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.910 
rate for dispenser our shooter things
that's<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.720> pretty<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.680> we

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
that's what it is pretty much what we

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.429 
that's what it is pretty much what we
call<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> machine<00:00:23.760> gun<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
call it a machine gun so this is the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.599 
call it a machine gun so this is the
first<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.609> resets<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.539> everything<00:00:27.990> um

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
first one it resets about everything um

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.690 
first one it resets about everything um
i<00:00:29.810> would<00:00:30.810> say<00:00:31.019> every<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.740> often<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.430> maybe

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
i would say every so often like maybe

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
i would say every so often like maybe
every<00:00:33.000> 10<00:00:33.420> seconds<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.230> um<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.390> makes<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
every 10 seconds or so um and it makes a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.430 
every 10 seconds or so um and it makes a
rapid<00:00:37.649> pulse<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.850> could<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.120> used<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
rapid pulse this could be used for you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280 
rapid pulse this could be used for you
have<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> machine<00:00:41.700> gun<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
have like a machine gun and you want it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
have like a machine gun and you want it
to<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:44.129> angry<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.910> something<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.420> don't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to like be angry or something I don't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
to like be angry or something I don't
know<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.649> second<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
know for like a second or two this is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
know for like a second or two this is
how<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
how would you do it this is how you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
how would you do it this is how you
would<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.930> um<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.860> next<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
would do it um the next one we have is a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
would do it um the next one we have is a
rapid<00:00:55.170> pulsar<00:00:55.910> which<00:00:56.910> uses<00:00:58.399> just<00:00:59.399> redstone

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
rapid pulsar which uses just redstone

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.539 
rapid pulsar which uses just redstone
torch<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> redstone<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.399 

this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.880> always<00:01:06.060> effective<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:07.080> if

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this is not always effective because if

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.429 
this is not always effective because if
you<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.990> redstone

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you don't have a lot of the redstone

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.370 
you don't have a lot of the redstone
torches<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.510> work<00:01:12.570> might<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
torches it might not work might just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.030 
torches it might not work might just
lock<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:15.110> which<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.439> happens<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:19.040> as

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
lock it which is what happens here as

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.660 
lock it which is what happens here as
you<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:20.909> doesn't<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.540> fire<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:22.259> each

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
you see doesn't really fire when each

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
you see doesn't really fire when each
when<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:23.939> indicates<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.350> red

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
when it actually indicates on the red

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
when it actually indicates on the red
stone<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.000> bet<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> flickering<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
stone but if I bet it's flickering I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
stone but if I bet it's flickering I
don't<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.740> why<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.939> should<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.650> have

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
don't know why it should this I have

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
don't know why it should this I have
this<00:01:32.220> problem<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> other<00:01:32.909> red<00:01:33.090> pulsar

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this problem with the other red pulsar

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.319 
this problem with the other red pulsar
but<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> had<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:34.890> other<00:01:35.100> minecraft<00:01:35.759> gun

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
but I had on my other minecraft gun

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.230 
but I had on my other minecraft gun
video<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> um<00:01:41.030> Adam<00:01:42.030> were

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
video and this is just a um Adam were

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
video and this is just a um Adam were
blocks<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.280> wasn't

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
blocks here as you see because it wasn't

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.410 
blocks here as you see because it wasn't
working<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.020> I'm<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.200> trying<00:01:46.439> things<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:47.420> um

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
working so I'm just trying things out um

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.760 
working so I'm just trying things out um
and<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.649> found<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.350> thing<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and I found out that the more thing the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
and I found out that the more thing the
more<00:01:52.979> um<00:01:53.420> redstone<00:01:54.420> torches<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.110> blocks<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
more um redstone torches and blocks you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.069 
more um redstone torches and blocks you
place<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.939> shoots<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
place the more of this thing shoots so

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.520 
place the more of this thing shoots so
I'm<00:01:58.140> guessing<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> hook<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.159> on<00:02:00.530> three

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I'm guessing if you hook up on three

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm guessing if you hook up on three
sides<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.969> fat<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
sides of this fat this kind of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.950 
sides of this fat this kind of
rapid<00:02:04.500> pollster<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.159> work<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.430> well

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
rapid pollster it would work really well

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.479 
rapid pollster it would work really well
and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.229> next<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and the next time we have is just a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.449 
and the next time we have is just a
regular<00:02:08.700> clock<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:10.459> redstone

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
regular clock with two redstone

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.850 
regular clock with two redstone
repeaters<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.050> problem<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.680> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
repeaters and the problem is this one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.330 
repeaters and the problem is this one
your<00:02:14.040> thumb

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
your thumb

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.190 
your thumb
only<00:02:14.519> reset<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.300> manually<00:02:15.959> activated<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
only reset and manually activated and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.190 
only reset and manually activated and
that<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.470> always<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.980> problem<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:21.000> clocks<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that is always a problem with clocks and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.490 
that is always a problem with clocks and
it<00:02:23.190> also<00:02:23.340> locks<00:02:24.060> every<00:02:24.360> time<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.599> log<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:25.280> so

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
it also locks every time you log in so

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.259 
it also locks every time you log in so
this<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.530> probably<00:02:29.010> one<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.209> more<00:02:32.269> found

redstone clock machine gun fire Raider

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.240 
redstone clock machine gun fire Raider
deciding<00:02:42.120> thing<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.980> would<00:02:43.980> say<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.980> just

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
deciding thing I would say and it just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.789 
deciding thing I would say and it just
shoots<00:02:47.549> mix<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.420> nice<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:49.290> times<00:02:51.799> higher

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
shoots mix it a nice good times higher

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.750 
shoots mix it a nice good times higher
rate<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.560> might<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> adjust<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
rate so you might have to adjust the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.180 
rate so you might have to adjust the
fire<00:02:57.120> rate<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.660> little<00:02:58.110> because<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.860> doesn't

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
fire rate a little because it doesn't

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.580 
fire rate a little because it doesn't
fire<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.760> don't<00:03:00.299> know<00:03:00.390> why<00:03:00.599> when<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.170> flickers

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
fire I don't know why when it flickers

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.339 
fire I don't know why when it flickers
like<00:03:01.890> every<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.879> tick<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.599> has<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.049> like

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
like every one tick it has to be like

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.170 
like every one tick it has to be like
three<00:03:04.709> four<00:03:04.980> tix<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:07.400> thing<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.610> wanted<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.030> show

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
three four tix so thing I wanted to show

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.680 
three four tix so thing I wanted to show
you<00:03:09.329> guys<00:03:09.709> for<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.860> video<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.390> happens

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
if you combine all three of them into

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.039 
if you combine all three of them into
one<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.940> your<00:03:18.209> own<00:03:18.630> you're<00:03:18.870> eating

one so I have your own you're eating

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.640 
one so I have your own you're eating
milk<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.519> your<00:03:20.519> clock<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.569> your<00:03:21.650> rapid

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
milk here your clock and your rapid

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.800 
milk here your clock and your rapid
pulsar<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.060> combine<00:03:24.269> all<00:03:24.450> three

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
pulsar and if you combine all three

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:35.000 
pulsar and if you combine all three
makes<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.380> super<00:03:25.829> amazing<00:03:27.950> machine<00:03:28.950> gun

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:04:22.700 

so<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.299> guys<00:03:36.450> watch<00:03:36.720> this

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.150 

so<00:04:23.550> as<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.819> see<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.389> very<00:04:24.539> fast

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
so as you see this is a very fast

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.330 
so as you see this is a very fast

or<00:04:53.849> even<00:04:54.270> multiplayer<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.710> I've<00:04:55.860> gone<00:04:56.039> ahead

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
or even multiplayer so I've gone ahead

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.810 
or even multiplayer so I've gone ahead
and<00:04:56.460> me<00:04:56.789> made<00:04:57.509> a<00:04:58.220> massive<00:05:01.039> what<00:05:02.039> I'm<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:02.400> wrapped

and me made a massive what I'm I wrapped

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.330 
and me made a massive what I'm I wrapped
one<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.360> angry<00:05:03.720> makers<00:05:04.139> with<00:05:04.889> lots<00:05:05.220> of

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
one of the angry makers with lots of

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.909 
one of the angry makers with lots of
those<00:05:05.580> one<00:05:06.150> with<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> cloth<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.080> one<00:05:07.590> with<00:05:07.889> a

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
those one with a cloth and one with a

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.210 
those one with a cloth and one with a
minecart<00:05:09.139> clock<00:05:10.139> which<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.889> pretty<00:05:10.979> much<00:05:11.160> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
minecart clock which is pretty much the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.610 
minecart clock which is pretty much the
same<00:05:11.520> thing<00:05:11.820> but<00:05:11.849> there<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:13.050> don't<00:05:13.470> have<00:05:13.530> to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
same thing but there I don't have to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.430 
same thing but there I don't have to
reset<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.009> like<00:05:14.599> every<00:05:15.599> time<00:05:15.750> they<00:05:15.870> log<00:05:15.990> on<00:05:16.050> so

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
reset it like every time they log on so

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.620 
reset it like every time they log on so
this<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.889> minecart<00:05:17.340> one<00:05:17.520> just<00:05:18.180> goes<00:05:18.330> over

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
this is the minecart one just goes over

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.879 
this is the minecart one just goes over
at<00:05:18.960> every<00:05:19.229> few<00:05:19.740> seconds<00:05:20.099> every<00:05:20.340> like<00:05:20.849> second

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
at every few seconds every like second

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.540 
at every few seconds every like second
so<00:05:22.889> this<00:05:23.099> is<00:05:23.130> me<00:05:23.460> manually<00:05:24.150> resetting<00:05:25.550> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
so this is me manually resetting the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.719 
so this is me manually resetting the
clock<00:05:26.930> look<00:05:27.930> redstone<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:29.340> enough<00:05:29.550> air

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
clock look redstone and have enough air

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.940 
clock look redstone and have enough air
was<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:30.000> there

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
was in there

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.320 
was in there
so<00:05:31.580> let's<00:05:31.850> turn<00:05:32.210> off<00:05:32.480> the<00:05:33.440> lock<00:05:33.710> on<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.340> angry

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
so let's turn off the lock on the angry

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.730 
so let's turn off the lock on the angry
makers<00:05:37.630> pick<00:05:38.630> up<00:05:38.780> instant<00:05:39.200> line<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:41.650> here<00:05:42.650> we

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
makers pick up instant line and here we

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.760 
makers pick up instant line and here we
go<00:05:42.860> summers<00:05:43.370> got<00:05:43.550> what<00:05:43.730> what<00:05:44.180> you<00:05:44.210> enjoy

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
go summers got what what you enjoy

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.400 
go summers got what what you enjoy
probably<00:05:45.770> about<00:05:45.920> maybe<00:05:46.750> seven<00:05:47.750> or<00:05:47.840> eight<00:05:47.990> per

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
probably about maybe seven or eight per

00:05:48.410 --> 00:06:08.810 
probably about maybe seven or eight per
second

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:18.820 

let's<00:06:09.360> watch

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.890
