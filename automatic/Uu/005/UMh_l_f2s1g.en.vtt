00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 Yes it is unfair 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.200
 8 summary It was 2000 yen in the hard off who bought junk PC . 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.780
 Though 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.040
 a First 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.830
 If the manual is not energized it will not start 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:31.300
 By say not to the 2 o'clock and not Toka orbit 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.380
 I bought it for some reason why I bought something that didn't start 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.030
 Huh 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:41.050
 And Well bring in well start to state that this does not start sound 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:46.059
 I like that sort of is by say fun when moved 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.430
 At first I bought it , so if it is 2000 yen, it's not expensive because I do not have cherry blossoms 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.430
 It was a matter of course 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.079
 I think I'm wondering, but first of all that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:01.070
 The coach is equipped with cpu is high pressure for well e 8500 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:08.180
 Originally I had a model number with that mouse computer, so I checked it 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:13.220
 The net search was done because the feature was found. Well cpu alone at a low price alone 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.510
 It 's worth noting that it is sold for about 700 yen, so the remaining 300 yen worth is well 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.540
 Somewhere variety 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.900
 It means that let's find Well 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.200
 I thought that I was loaded 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 I'd tried to currently doing now power put 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.799
 It's okay 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880
 I do not know anyone who plays 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.620
 In a 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.650
 It is generally said that you do not have to go ahead 2 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.500
 this 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:43.030
 Made on whether or motherboard-related or if the switch is wrong has been done field power at home 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.860
 But it is wrapped is roughly where to look first to the Well 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.290
 Hey you 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.800
 Well now 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.630
 It's in this state, so I wo n't add anything. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.880
 Well from now in various ways 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 I will try to find out 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.980
 It is not that the Yes eh 8 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.120
 We have to state that the roses come for from Well case I pay taken everything from the inside 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.950
 so 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.970
 I will not a little horizontal and memory 22 Tsun 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.970
 It feels like I renovate two sheets because I care about tr corner 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.740
 I 'm getting out of the case right now In this state the power supply is well alive power supply 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.080
 And Well But I'm a person of switch 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.710
 Or Te such a push to see that bedding 13 bodies in Fu say Well this Well When was if any 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.640
 Of Risaku pc owner 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:49.680
 Well I think that it should be corresponding to say so in those and say, switch and Kagu' of the power confirmation 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.790
 Oh now cpu 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.989
 Well, the very first in the state one memory of the cpu and cpu cooler to the motherboard 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.470
 It is the configuration 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.920
 So that's the motherboard that 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:11.500
 As there is gpu function , from there 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.500
 It is in the state which is making the screen white well, and I think that I would like to put on the switch with this. 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.500
 The cpu cooler is turning and now I'm in a state that I'm all 2 now 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.500
 right 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.830
 Te' have 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 As you can see if you see it, we have started bios 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:36.230
 That means that Mother and her cpu and memory were alive. 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.470
 Well gamers death seater cause also Well this guy is does it mean Well the power supply was useless 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.310
 It means 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.940
 But it is the fact that revert to the state based on the move once the power even I exchange because 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.940
 Yes 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.020
 Because it has gpu also attached , I would like to check the operation of the gpu 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.020
 I will 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.790
 It's was great N moat live 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.840
 Well speaking of the power supply 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.250
 gpo's visit 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.060
 I was stuck in turning this 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 Advance of the power supply or minutes of guarantee cash here 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.060
 Various places are good Hey yes 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.409
 It Tteyuu always listened also towards the gpu so we out bios screen today 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.489
 Yes yes no problem 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.489
 It's broken because of that, it's just that it was completely in power . 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.449
 Beneath Well Well power reassemble in So yes 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.860
 Replace it 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:55.740
 Two that I Well doctor increases is also memory 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.830
 Two 1st places added 2 pieces of junk goods of junk goods 50 yen 1 piece 50 yen 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.800
 so 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:10.630
 in the direction of geforce 9600 is more of there Well I'd have been first installed 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.630
 9800 gtx here was also reloaded to 500 yen column in the junk 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.150
 Penalty law Well power button too 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.440
 Like 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.440
 As we put on without problem 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.889
 Switcher enters 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:35.490
 It also says a problem things better between screen 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.490
