00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
people know this but the DNA patterns

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.300 
people know this but the DNA patterns
and<00:04:12.600> our<00:04:12.660> cloning<00:04:13.200> banks<00:04:13.530> are<00:04:13.680> becoming<00:04:13.800> more

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
and our cloning banks are becoming more

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.870 
and our cloning banks are becoming more
and<00:04:14.580> more<00:04:14.640> degraded<00:04:15.390> with<00:04:15.510> each<00:04:15.750> new<00:04:16.079> clone

retain our immortality through cloning
of<00:04:22.800> course<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.700> bad

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
of course it's bad

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.280 
of course it's bad
