00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.989
 the high price for doctors the golden key let's see an introduction about the 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.769
 that really connect me the camera on the hand and the forearm that just by josue b 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.580
 then virtually all the sites you access 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.240
 it is done in html so you can check it by pressing the control key or 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.230
 you will notice a number of handles warning marking - in the source code 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.000
 of the html site means and perplexes to mark by the agent or is a language of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 It's important to use that one until half a baby is not a 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 programming language is a markup language less than 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.449
 marking is a set of tax 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.550
 your marking is usually in 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.440
 html uses dialing times to describe web pages and such 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.520
 of marking that we are learning and curriculum of the technical course of tmn 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.579
 marking beating on it are usually called dites agathe metal then it is 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.900
 When we tite people, you hardly ever heard of them. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.010
 html markup and integrates the first step 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.149
 it is the first action 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.549
 Angle Prejudices as in this example here that we have 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.389
 the early afternoon is the opening of the tmn until it reaches me it normally 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.680
 come in pairs like in this example that we have one has a cry is with signal 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.879
 here of smaller dirty signal of greater here would be the content signal of smaller bar 

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:30.659
 space 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.579
 that she 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.520
 the closure until then only the north of the majority 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.140
 we would have a content markedly my granddaughter 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.479
 and that this content when viewed in the bold series browser is then 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.780
 that way you can do some marking we will do 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.900
 some examples there in the course of ideologues the first until it has a 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.500
 parent until ataÃ­de beginning 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 that your team b 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.320
 the second and final technique 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.500
 until the end you usually did she bounced the potato 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.540
 We'll learn more about this. 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.290
 in the video if you are going to stop here some tax is not necessary 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.150
 technicians to repair to be the agent which is what some examples of html 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.300
 Tarp demarcation so you may notice that these examples that are 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.530
 examples will be in all codus camouflaged 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.359
 so we open ourselves to the first step that is this form and the 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.269
 closing of the first bad hypothesis delivery the first hypothesis the delivery 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.069
 first write the web page so that you 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.690
 pre-season website 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.889
 strength in the marking that is the first power between borebi 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.689
 to power is the harmful content of the page then the page you 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.819
 view the ninth on your screen 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.619
 m 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.210
 all markings 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.610
 what html stay 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.639
 stay inside these tags here 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.529
 that the beautiful tag means the body of the user the full text effect calls 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.309
 eternal 1 displayed as a title 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.409
 so if you usually have the map title you normally do 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.960
 marking this title with organ stems 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.720
 it expects that the paragraph is later displayed a paragraph 1 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.810
 the content you normally train on your pages these tags here are 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.210
 very simple does not have much secret late and here comes the doubt of the staff as they are 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.569
 various voltage html html bridge or html point 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.719
 when you are saved here you can use both the full-length mishap 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.180
 merit there is no difference 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.569
 usually if we are going to use some html file you will see the 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.790
 usually human as html bridge 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 It's because I'm used to it, but you can save it. 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.570
 if you want to point out that even my tip of the tmn does not make a difference 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.480
 so use the introduction class name about what my team is 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.760
 is because from the next videotape we will not start to develop 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360
 that will be practical video lessons are all that we develop people 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.480
 already going to test at the time things work and you can follow up doing in 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.920
 your computer then our best stayed here until the next
