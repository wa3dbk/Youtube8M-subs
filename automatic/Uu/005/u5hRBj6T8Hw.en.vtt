00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 We had sauce based on that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 then for the filling we take spinach 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.620
 Sauce comes afterwards on top of cheese substitute 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660

 delicious and still nutmeg for the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 Laundry then we go right away 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.129
 For the filling you just have to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.140
 heat spinach 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 I already have onions here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 can also shop normal removals yet 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 fry before 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.610
 the spinach and our soja 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 Collect this that we heated together 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.220
 does not have to cook properly 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.270
 not really really hot and wanted 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 yourself only this frozen spinach solution 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.850
 next time the tomato sauce 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.710
 I now have olives here before 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.640
 and hot comes here comes the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640
 cut a lot in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.750
 and that will be for two minutes now 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.340
 glassy sweat that now the spinach 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 Soon you can finish salting 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.520
 pepper with it gets the taste 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.930
 but otherwise he is ready so far 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.880
 no longer does the onions are now 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 so far done here come the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.020
 tomato sauce to it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.270
 Stir 10 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.150
 what I still like to do with it 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 pieces are not that big 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.210
 I know and potato mash and do 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.740
 you all still a bit smaller so 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.920
 that according to those so big tomato pieces 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.570
 are in the sauce and sauces this 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.810
 basis the economy set 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.180
 you have to go with aline spices and salt and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.500
 pepper a little sugar always on the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.140
 tomato sauce a little bit sugar 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.810
 make the superphone like itself and then 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 that is already finished 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.440
 Now we have minimal work 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.390
 already the tomatoes and the for and for 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.420
 Never finish the channels first 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 we just take a few spoonfuls of that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 tomato sauce as a basis in the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:50.120
 distribute casserole dish 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.570
 and then come the category on the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.070
 still medium stuffed when I have the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.300
 filling in the camel without making power 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.760
 Of course, I am always numerous around 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.530
 just spoon and you stop yours 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.310
 purest determined to prove but elegant 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.709
 I'm doing this, however, like the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.769
 coalition with the fingers a bit 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.660
 to everything as the plate because it 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.890
 that's why traveling is good too 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.800
 if the game is way too hot 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.400
 then you can do that but I want 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.400
 intervene 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.820
 whole spinach now comes next to money 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.230
 he after the studies head after so 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230
 nothing is left 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.500
 the full is just hang up 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.010
 make our tomato sauce that until the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.680
 casserole dish really nice when 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.230
 normal filled they are so out 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.370
 also nothing left of the player 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:55.480
 and now comes the rest 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.480
 tomato sauce distributed nicely 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:15.950
 and now only the till is missing 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.199
 now something must be in between 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.449
 can be addressed with the topic dose man 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.769
 always feeling and then you 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.210
 you will need it afterwards 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.759
 so take about the same amount 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.110
 me ever ready to make the wait 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.000
 it still short term or melted 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.600
 So the good side wants it 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.080
 disbanded 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.919
 Now we add something more 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.280
 and then with whisk together 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.280
 stir 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:53.449
 I never do that according to quantities 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:56.780
 but just feel so men 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:01.030
 there are no more in it then we can do that 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.030
 whole with him looking forward to flow 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.170
 unattractive mix that I no 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.810
 you can now also want to clink 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.350
 get started with salt pepper and 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.590
 nutmeg which must be beautiful 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.590
 wake up 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.090
 I'll just wait until I get this one 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.420
 little has been created and it can 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.070
 already 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.530
 and if the laundry in the good 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.770
 consistency then just comes here 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.770
 about it 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.979
 afterwards it shows until the 3 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.710
 scratching in the color noise 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.430
 and the good is not there now 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.650
 cheese or something over it 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.200
 that is perfect now that junes the 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.060
 then brown beautiful of taste is 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.910
 So what is cream so please no 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.610
 buy funny overpriced cheese substitute 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.450
 just leave out any interested in sow 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.450
 cyprus schmidt 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.110
 that can now be done in the preheated 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.090
 oven is about half an hour 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.690
 but you can always be with a 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.820
 fork is already through 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.500
 That's how it looks when it's done 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.419
 a pub like to sear them 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.550
 you could still do basilikum 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.620
 or fresh salad and the beautiful 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.090
 The recipe is based on the filling 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.680
 shape differently if you prefer 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.960
 you want to have mushrooms in it you make one 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.970
 Mushrooming is just great 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.500
 simple very fast recipe that 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.030

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.240
