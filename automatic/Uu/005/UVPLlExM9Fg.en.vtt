the<00:02:39.590> blade<00:02:39.820> because<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.150> contact<00:02:41.600> point<00:02:41.840> on

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
the blade because the contact point on

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.900 
the blade because the contact point on
that<00:02:42.080> would<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:43.010> small<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.580> with<00:02:43.730> this

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
that would be really small but with this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.020 
that would be really small but with this
notch<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.530> probably<00:02:46.190> two<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> three

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
notch you get probably two to three

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.650 
notch you get probably two to three
times<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.769> surface<00:02:48.980> area<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:50.060> contact<00:02:50.090> with

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
times the surface area in contact with

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.860 
times the surface area in contact with
the<00:02:50.780> blade<00:02:52.390> Scandi<00:02:53.390> grind

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the blade Scandi grind

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.300 
the blade Scandi grind
I<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.670> grind<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.840> outdoor

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
I like that grind on on the outdoor

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.670 
I like that grind on on the outdoor
bushcrafting<00:02:58.310> knives<00:02:59.200> just<00:03:00.200> good<00:03:00.500> for

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
bushcrafting knives just good for

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.220 
bushcrafting knives just good for
carving<00:03:01.070> not<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.090> other<00:03:02.510> grinds<00:03:02.900> don't<00:03:03.080> work

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
carving not that other grinds don't work

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.390 
carving not that other grinds don't work
but<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.530> prefer<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:05.030> Scandi<00:03:05.450> grind<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.140> that's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
but I prefer the Scandi grind so that's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.600 
but I prefer the Scandi grind so that's
usually<00:03:07.400> what<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.550> suggest<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.420> knife

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.960 

so<00:03:13.610> there's<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.940> knife<00:03:15.520> here's<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.730> sheath

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
so there's the knife here's the sheath

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.930 
so there's the knife here's the sheath
for<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.630> knife<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.890> black<00:03:19.190> Kydex<00:03:19.610> on<00:03:19.790> one

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
for the knife it's black Kydex on one

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.480 
for the knife it's black Kydex on one
side<00:03:20.260> high-visibility<00:03:21.260> yellow<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.460> other

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
side high-visibility yellow on the other

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.360 
side high-visibility yellow on the other
I<00:03:22.930> have<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.050> set<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.380> for<00:03:24.770> scout<00:03:25.070> carry

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
I have it set up here for scout carry

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.040 
I have it set up here for scout carry
this<00:03:25.820> is<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> way<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.390> carried<00:03:26.720> my<00:03:26.840> knife

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
this is the way that I carried my knife

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.310 
this is the way that I carried my knife
when<00:03:27.350> I'm<00:03:27.470> hiking<00:03:27.920> or<00:03:28.220> backpacking<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
when I'm hiking or backpacking so I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.590 
when I'm hiking or backpacking so I
these<00:03:31.100> loops<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.790> made<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.270> actually<00:03:32.510> be

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
these loops that I made can actually be

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.590 
these loops that I made can actually be
removed<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.560> turned<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.120> knife<00:03:35.390> can

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
removed and turned so that the knife can

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.560 
removed and turned so that the knife can
also<00:03:35.720> be<00:03:35.960> carried<00:03:36.200> vertically<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> fire

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
also be carried vertically the fire

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.110 
also be carried vertically the fire
steel<00:03:38.930> loop<00:03:39.170> can<00:03:39.860> all<00:03:39.950> be<00:03:40.130> removed<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.000> I'll

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
steel loop can all be removed so I'll

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.670 
steel loop can all be removed so I'll
held<00:03:41.330> together<00:03:41.450> with<00:03:41.630> Chicago<00:03:42.140> screws<00:03:42.410> here

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
held together with Chicago screws here

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.430 
held together with Chicago screws here
so<00:03:42.830> he<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.510> relocate<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.660> fire<00:03:44.840> steel<00:03:45.170> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
so he can relocate the fire steel to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.080 
so he can relocate the fire steel to
these<00:03:45.710> two<00:03:45.950> holes<00:03:46.190> or<00:03:46.490> these<00:03:46.640> two<00:03:46.850> holes

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
these two holes or these two holes

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.090 
these two holes or these two holes
depending<00:03:47.390> on<00:03:47.720> how<00:03:47.870> he<00:03:47.930> wants<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.320> carry<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.770> if

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
depending on how he wants to carry it if

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.380 
depending on how he wants to carry it if
he's<00:03:49.250> gonna<00:03:49.370> carry<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.790> night<00:03:49.940> vertically

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
he's gonna carry the night vertically

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.170 
he's gonna carry the night vertically
he'll<00:03:51.230> need<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.440> move<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.920> move<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.000> fire

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
he'll need to move the move the fire

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.570 
he'll need to move the move the fire
steel<00:03:53.480> down<00:03:53.690> one<00:03:54.320> thing<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.650> will<00:03:54.830> change<00:03:55.190> in

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
steel down one thing I will change in

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.510 
steel down one thing I will change in
future<00:03:55.750> sheets<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.650> will<00:03:57.800> also<00:03:58.100> make<00:03:58.280> these

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
future sheets is I will also make these

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.240 
future sheets is I will also make these
holes<00:03:59.420> down<00:03:59.630> here<00:03:59.959> at<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.140> bottom<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.980> same

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
holes down here at the bottom the same

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.100 
holes down here at the bottom the same
distance<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.270> actually<00:04:02.420> carry<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
distance so you can actually carry the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.230 
distance so you can actually carry the
fire<00:04:03.410> steel<00:04:03.740> horizontally<00:04:04.430> well<00:04:04.760> while<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
fire steel horizontally well while the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.470 
fire steel horizontally well while the
sheath<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.720> vertical<00:04:05.780> on<00:04:06.260> his<00:04:06.350> belt<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:08.150> can

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
sheath is vertical on his belt I can

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.520 
sheath is vertical on his belt I can
also<00:04:08.750> do<00:04:09.670> MOLLE<00:04:10.670> straps<00:04:10.820> if<00:04:11.330> he<00:04:11.450> wants<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.720> run

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
also do MOLLE straps if he wants to run

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.800 
also do MOLLE straps if he wants to run
it<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:12.800> MOLLE<00:04:13.040> pack<00:04:13.310> but<00:04:13.880> from<00:04:14.660> what<00:04:14.780> I

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
it on a MOLLE pack but from what I

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.420 
it on a MOLLE pack but from what I
understand<00:04:15.290> he'll<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:15.800> be<00:04:15.950> carrying<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.340> on

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
understand he'll just be carrying it on

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.690 
understand he'll just be carrying it on
his<00:04:16.549> belt<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.530> retention<00:04:18.830> on<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.190> sheath<00:04:19.370> is

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
his belt the retention on the sheath is

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:31.180 
his belt the retention on the sheath is
really<00:04:20.510> good<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.320> is

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.360 

and<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.820> made<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.950> made<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> matching<00:04:34.220> fire<00:04:34.670> steel

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
and I made a made a matching fire steel

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.490 
and I made a made a matching fire steel
with<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.400> same<00:04:37.700> g10<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.390> what<00:04:39.380> I'm<00:04:39.470> doing

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
with the same g10 and what I'm doing

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.120 
with the same g10 and what I'm doing
with<00:04:39.740> these<00:04:40.010> with<00:04:40.900> Ferro<00:04:41.900> rod<00:04:42.020> fire<00:04:42.620> steel<00:04:42.980> is

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
with these with Ferro rod fire steel is

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.270 
with these with Ferro rod fire steel is
a<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.850> brand<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.800> what<00:04:45.800> I'm<00:04:45.890> doing<00:04:46.160> with

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
a is a brand but what I'm doing with

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.900 
a is a brand but what I'm doing with
mine<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.670> I'm<00:04:46.820> using<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.450> little<00:04:47.660> rollover<00:04:48.440> pin

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
mine is I'm using a little rollover pin

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.220 
mine is I'm using a little rollover pin
drilled<00:04:49.910> through<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.240> Ferro<00:04:50.570> rod<00:04:50.690> and

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
drilled through the Ferro rod and

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.390 
drilled through the Ferro rod and
obviously<00:04:51.560> through<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.950> handle

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
obviously through the handle

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.970 
obviously through the handle
so<00:04:52.730> once<00:04:53.180> he<00:04:53.300> wears<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.930> if<00:04:54.170> he<00:04:54.530> ever<00:04:54.680> wears

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
so once he wears this if he ever wears
