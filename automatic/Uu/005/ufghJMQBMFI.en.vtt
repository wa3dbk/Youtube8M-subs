devastated around so I just got three
perks<00:02:17.120> once<00:02:17.599> right<00:02:17.810> here<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.380> went

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
perks once right here and then I went

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
perks once right here and then I went
back<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> sut<00:02:19.580> rest<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.870> let's<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:21.560> to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
back to the sut rest and let's get to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.180 
back to the sut rest and let's get to
the<00:02:21.739> second<00:02:22.100> down<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:22.400> which<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:23.390> round<00:02:23.630> 23

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the second down now which is on round 23

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.770 
the second down now which is on round 23
so<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.519> is<00:02:25.549> what<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.790> did<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.269> rid<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
so this is what I did to get rid of the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.580 
so this is what I did to get rid of the
zombies<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.319> used<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.769> Betty<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.200> yeah<00:02:30.200> Cameron

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
zombies I used a Betty and yeah Cameron

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.010 
zombies I used a Betty and yeah Cameron
rose<00:02:30.769> from<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.250> then

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
rose from and then

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.120 
rose from and then
Sean<00:02:32.800> now<00:02:33.010> which<00:02:33.580> seems<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> work<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:35.770> um

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
Sean now which seems to work because um

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.580 
Sean now which seems to work because um
STG<00:02:36.940> doesn't<00:02:37.210> have<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.450> much<00:02:37.570> damage<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
STG doesn't have that much damage to it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
STG doesn't have that much damage to it
so<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.860> would<00:02:38.950> take<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> long<00:02:39.340> time<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:40.060> hit

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
so it would take a long time to just hit

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
so it would take a long time to just hit
fire<00:02:40.630> though<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.350> didn't<00:02:41.590> even<00:02:41.620> notice<00:02:41.950> the
