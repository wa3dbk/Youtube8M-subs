00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
found a long time ago it was within
modern<00:01:25.409> warfare<00:01:25.650> 3<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> mission

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
modern warfare 3 and it was a mission

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.399 
modern warfare 3 and it was a mission
that<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that you can do and it's actually the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.289 
that you can do and it's actually the
interesting<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> couple

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
interesting thing is that it's a couple

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
interesting thing is that it's a couple
of<00:01:30.420> missions<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> too

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
of missions it's not just one it's too

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700 
of missions it's not just one it's too
and<00:01:32.340> basically<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> easter<00:01:33.810> egg<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and basically the easter egg is one of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
and basically the easter egg is one of
samantha<00:01:35.369> holding<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.000> teddy<00:01:36.210> bear<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.780> her

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
samantha holding a teddy bear with her

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
samantha holding a teddy bear with her
right<00:01:37.140> hand<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:37.979> went<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.310> left<00:01:38.520> hand

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
right hand and then went for left hand

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
right hand and then went for left hand
she<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> sledge<00:01:39.390> hammer<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.869> her<00:01:40.049> shoulder

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
she has a sledge hammer on her shoulder

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.389 
she has a sledge hammer on her shoulder
and<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.070> sledge<00:01:41.340> hammer<00:01:41.610> says<00:01:41.939> SH<00:01:43.100> G<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and the sledge hammer says SH G so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
and the sledge hammer says SH G so
sledgehammer<00:01:45.149> games<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.710> cool

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
sledgehammer games and it's really cool

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
sledgehammer games and it's really cool
because<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.270> modern

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
because this was back when modern

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
because this was back when modern
warfare<00:01:48.810> 3<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.860> when

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
warfare 3 was out this was back when

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
warfare 3 was out this was back when
sledgehammer<00:01:50.880> games<00:01:51.000> helped<00:01:51.600> make<00:01:51.899> modern

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
sledgehammer games helped make modern

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
sledgehammer games helped make modern
warfare<00:01:52.860> 3<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.579> think<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.060> actually

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
warfare 3 and I think they actually

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
warfare 3 and I think they actually
helped<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.899> survival<00:01:55.500> portion<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
helped out on a survival portion of the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.980 
helped out on a survival portion of the
game<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:57.390> made<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> reference<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
game and they made a reference to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
game and they made a reference to
Samantha<00:01:58.500> which<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> pretty<00:01:58.890> interesting<00:01:59.130> now

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
Samantha which is pretty interesting now

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.830 
Samantha which is pretty interesting now
what<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.909> mean<00:02:00.090> does<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.509> mean<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
what could that mean does that mean that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.380 
what could that mean does that mean that
maybe<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:02.189> were<00:02:02.490> told<00:02:02.729> hey<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> guys<00:02:03.270> are

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
maybe they were told hey you guys are

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.690 
maybe they were told hey you guys are
going<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
going to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.190 
going to
working<00:02:04.060> on<00:02:04.119> your<00:02:04.180> own<00:02:04.479> call<00:02:04.780> duty<00:02:04.960> game

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
working on your own call duty game

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050 
working on your own call duty game
sometime<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.890> future<00:02:06.039> and<00:02:06.490> maybe<00:02:06.850> they're

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
sometime in the future and maybe they're

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.279 
sometime in the future and maybe they're
thinking<00:02:07.420> hey<00:02:07.570> we're<00:02:07.719> going<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.899> do<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.019> quad

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
thinking hey we're going to do a quad

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.199 
thinking hey we're going to do a quad
most<00:02:08.500> similar<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.890> zombies<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.910> could<00:02:10.090> be

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
most similar to zombies it could be

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.729 
most similar to zombies it could be
anything<00:02:10.450> guys<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:10.989> at<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> end<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> day

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
anything guys but at the end of the day

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.650 
anything guys but at the end of the day
the<00:02:11.890> fact<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.160> they<00:02:12.340> put<00:02:12.519> in<00:02:12.640> Samantha<00:02:13.180> lets

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the fact that they put in Samantha lets

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.119 
the fact that they put in Samantha lets
us<00:02:13.810> know<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.989> they<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.290> really<00:02:14.650> aware<00:02:14.769> of

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
us know that they are really aware of

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.880 
us know that they are really aware of
just<00:02:15.700> how<00:02:15.819> big<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.360> present<00:02:16.810> zombies<00:02:17.349> has<00:02:17.620> on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
just how big of a present zombies has on

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.580 
just how big of a present zombies has on
the<00:02:18.040> community<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:19.060> could<00:02:19.720> we<00:02:19.810> possibly<00:02:20.230> still

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the community so could we possibly still

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.080 
the community so could we possibly still
be<00:02:20.650> seeing<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.430> co-op<00:02:21.790> mode<00:02:21.970> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
be seeing that for co-op mode that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
be seeing that for co-op mode that
everyone<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.660> hoping<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.200> there<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.440> going

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
everyone is hoping that there is going

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.680 
everyone is hoping that there is going
to<00:02:23.739> be<00:02:23.769> something<00:02:24.099> that's<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.550> survival<00:02:25.269> will

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
to be something that's not survival will

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.270 
to be something that's not survival will
never<00:02:25.840> know<00:02:25.989> guys<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.830> know<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> wanted<00:02:27.220> to
