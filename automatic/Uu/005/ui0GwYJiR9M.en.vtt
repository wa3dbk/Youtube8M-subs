from<00:00:09.120> exam<00:00:10.160> so<00:00:11.160> now<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.360> focus<00:00:12.809> was<00:00:13.049> on

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
from exam so now the focus was on

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.740 
from exam so now the focus was on
finding<00:00:13.889> out<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.370> biochemical<00:00:15.000> nature<00:00:15.179> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
finding out the biochemical nature of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.220 
finding out the biochemical nature of
the<00:00:15.960> transforming<00:00:16.710> principle<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> now

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the transforming principle so now

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
the transforming principle so now
regarding<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> biochemical<00:00:20.699> nature<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
regarding the biochemical nature of the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
regarding the biochemical nature of the
transforming<00:00:22.289> principles<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.100> transforming

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
transforming principles of transforming

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.500 
transforming principles of transforming
principle<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> name<00:00:24.960> given<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:26.510> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
principle was the name given to them the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.269 
principle was the name given to them the
substance<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> getting<00:00:28.560> passed<00:00:28.920> on

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
substance which is getting passed on

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.510 
substance which is getting passed on
from<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:30.080> bacteria<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.890> bacteria

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
from one bacteria to the other bacteria

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920 
from one bacteria to the other bacteria
so<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> substance<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.690> called

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so that substance was called

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.380 
so that substance was called
transforming<00:00:34.620> principle<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:35.280> Griffith<00:00:35.700> now

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
transforming principle by Griffith now

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
transforming principle by Griffith now
in<00:00:36.540> order<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> biochemical<00:00:38.879> nature

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
in order to know the biochemical nature

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.610 
in order to know the biochemical nature
of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> transforming<00:00:40.320> principle<00:00:40.850> somebody

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
of the transforming principle somebody

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
of the transforming principle somebody
thought<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.460> protein<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
thought that it could be protein some of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.549 
thought that it could be protein some of
them<00:00:45.960> thought<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> could<00:00:46.770> also<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.250> facts<00:00:47.730> or

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
them thought it could also be facts or

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
them thought it could also be facts or
carbohydrate<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.219> could<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.579> nucleic

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
carbohydrate or it could be nucleic

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
carbohydrate or it could be nucleic
acids<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.260> opinions

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
acids so there are different opinions

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.090 
acids so there are different opinions
than<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> could<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.100> bacteriologists

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
than what it could be so bacteriologists

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.069 
than what it could be so bacteriologists
performed<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> series<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> experiments<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
performed a series of experiments to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.189 
performed a series of experiments to
identify<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.059> transforming<00:01:00.059> principle<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
identify the transforming principle so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
identify the transforming principle so
some<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> experiments<00:01:02.309> which<00:01:02.489> they

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
some of the experiments which they

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.810 
some of the experiments which they
performed<00:01:03.270> where<00:01:03.739> they<00:01:04.739> precipitated<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
performed where they precipitated the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.950 
performed where they precipitated the
transforming<00:01:06.570> principle<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.680> alcohol<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
transforming principle with alcohol and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
transforming principle with alcohol and
it<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.170> found<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.369> transforming

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it was found that the transforming

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
it was found that the transforming
principle<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.990> precipitated<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:14.490> alcohol

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
principle was precipitated when alcohol

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.539 
principle was precipitated when alcohol
was<00:01:15.450> added<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.860> did<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> truth

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
was added to it so what did this truth

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
was added to it so what did this truth
thus<00:01:17.880> prove<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
thus prove that it was not a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
thus prove that it was not a
carbohydrate<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:21.960> been<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
carbohydrate because had it been a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
carbohydrate because had it been a
carbohydrate<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.210> not

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
carbohydrate it would have not

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
carbohydrate it would have not
precipitated<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.710> alcohol<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.790> these<00:01:26.909> are

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
precipitated with alcohol so these are

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.719 
precipitated with alcohol so these are
some<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.570> properties<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
some of the properties of a is a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.719 
some of the properties of a is a
different<00:01:31.130> biomolecules<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
different biomolecules like the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
different biomolecules like the
properties<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> carbohydrates<00:01:34.229> proteins<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
properties of carbohydrates proteins and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
properties of carbohydrates proteins and
I<00:01:35.070> hope<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.520> aware<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> they

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
I hope you are aware of them it is they

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.450 
I hope you are aware of them it is they
also<00:01:38.119> used<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:40.049> protein<00:01:40.560> digesting<00:01:41.280> enzymes

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
also used the protein digesting enzymes

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.630 
also used the protein digesting enzymes
called<00:01:42.090> proteases<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:43.619> found<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
called proteases so they found that the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
called proteases so they found that the
transforming<00:01:45.420> principle<00:01:45.540> could<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.439> be

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
transforming principle could not be

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
transforming principle could not be
destroyed<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.460> proteases<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> say

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
destroyed with proteases when I say

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
destroyed with proteases when I say
destroy<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.560> means<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.520> example

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
destroy it means that for example

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.660 
destroy it means that for example
proteins<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.290> enzymes<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:53.100> digest

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
proteins are the enzymes which digest

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.929 
proteins are the enzymes which digest
them<00:01:53.970> proteins<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> mix<00:01:56.340> protease

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
them proteins so if you mix protease

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.969 
them proteins so if you mix protease
with<00:01:57.390> approve<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.020> proteins<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.799> will

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
with approve with proteins what will

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
with approve with proteins what will
happen<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> proteins<00:01:59.790> will<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.180> destroyed

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
happen the proteins will get destroyed

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
happen the proteins will get destroyed
destroyed<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> sense<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> proteins<00:02:02.130> will

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
destroyed in the sense the proteins will

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.730 
destroyed in the sense the proteins will
get<00:02:02.520> digested<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.110> found<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
get digested but it was found that the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.770 
get digested but it was found that the
transforming<00:02:05.460> principle<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.540> be

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
transforming principle would not be

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.320 
transforming principle would not be
destroyed<00:02:07.290> with<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.590> proteases<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.879> does<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
destroyed with the proteases or does the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.940 
destroyed with the proteases or does the
school

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
school

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.800 
school
this<00:02:10.160> proves<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> transforming

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
this proves that the transforming

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.280 
this proves that the transforming
principle<00:02:11.959> was<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.620> even<00:02:13.250> proteins<00:02:14.290> because

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
principle was not even proteins because

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.660 
principle was not even proteins because
I<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.590> been<00:02:15.739> proteins<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> proteins

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
I have been proteins and the proteins

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.820 
I have been proteins and the proteins
would<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.330> digested<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.200> transform<00:02:18.680> in

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
would have digested the transform in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.160 
would have digested the transform in
principle<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.239> also<00:02:20.569> found<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.989> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
principle it was also found that the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.020 
principle it was also found that the
transforming<00:02:21.890> principle<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.610> not<00:02:22.849> be

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
transforming principle could not be

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.510 
transforming principle could not be
digested<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:24.020> could<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.650> destroyed<00:02:25.250> with

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
digested or could not be destroyed with

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.610 
digested or could not be destroyed with
light<00:02:25.760> breezes<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.930> means<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.440> were

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
light breezes so that means there were

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.309 
light breezes so that means there were
neither<00:02:27.980> lipids<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.300> they<00:02:29.540> were<00:02:29.600> not<00:02:29.959> fiber

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
neither lipids so they were not fiber

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.199 
neither lipids so they were not fiber
heads<00:02:30.890> they<00:02:31.069> were<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.340> proteins<00:02:31.910> they<00:02:32.180> are

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
heads they were not proteins they are

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.430 
heads they were not proteins they are
not<00:02:32.540> lipids<00:02:33.080> or<00:02:33.319> fats<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.660> what<00:02:35.840> were<00:02:36.019> they

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
not lipids or fats so so what were they

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
not lipids or fats so so what were they
now<00:02:36.980> these<00:02:37.160> transforming<00:02:37.880> principle<00:02:38.000> then

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
now these transforming principle then

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.660 
now these transforming principle then
looked<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.500> similar<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.099> nucleic

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
looked like little similar to nucleic

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.790 
looked like little similar to nucleic
acids<00:02:41.060> feathers<00:02:41.420> they<00:02:41.870> might<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.290> rich<00:02:42.500> in

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
acids feathers they might be rich in

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.250 
acids feathers they might be rich in
nucleic<00:02:43.489> acids<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.450> nucleic<00:02:44.810> acids

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
nucleic acids but in in nucleic acids

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.680 
nucleic acids but in in nucleic acids
there<00:02:45.739> were<00:02:45.890> two<00:02:46.069> options<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.760> RNA<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
there were two options one is RNA the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.509 
there were two options one is RNA the
other<00:02:47.840> one<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.110> DNA<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.980> what<00:02:49.130> would<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.400> that

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
other one is DNA so what would be that

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.660 
other one is DNA so what would be that
so<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:51.019> tried<00:02:51.410> with<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.100> enzyme

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
so then it was tried with the enzyme

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.809 
so then it was tried with the enzyme
that<00:02:53.239> digests<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.110> ripen<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:55.010> click<00:02:55.310> acid

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
that digests the ripen you click acid

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.539 
that digests the ripen you click acid
that<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.090> RNA<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.230> was<00:02:57.440> ripe<00:02:57.709> or<00:02:57.980> nucleus

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
that is RNA and that was ripe or nucleus

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.340 
that is RNA and that was ripe or nucleus
and<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.970> was<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.330> observed<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
and it was so observed that the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.870 
and it was so observed that the
transforming<00:03:01.069> principle<00:03:01.220> was<00:03:01.850> not

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
transforming principle was not

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.080 
transforming principle was not
inactivated<00:03:02.780> with<00:03:03.380> rival<00:03:03.860> nucleus<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:04.910> what

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
inactivated with rival nucleus so what

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.300 
inactivated with rival nucleus so what
did<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.420> goof<00:03:05.720> disproved<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> was<00:03:07.040> not

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
did this goof disproved that it was not

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.180 
did this goof disproved that it was not
RNA<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.569> now<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.780> only<00:03:09.140> option<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.650> was<00:03:09.920> left

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
RNA so now the only option that was left

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.310 
RNA so now the only option that was left
over<00:03:10.400> was<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.910> DNA<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.769> they<00:03:13.150> found<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.720> when

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
over was the DNA so they found that when

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.509 
over was the DNA so they found that when
they<00:03:15.500> use<00:03:16.209> deoxyribonucleic<00:03:18.519> debated

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
they use deoxyribonucleic debated

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.140 
they use deoxyribonucleic debated
proving<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.810> was<00:03:20.870> DNA<00:03:21.730> because<00:03:22.730> when<00:03:22.940> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
proving that it was DNA because when the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.720 
proving that it was DNA because when the
DNA<00:03:23.480> digesting<00:03:24.290> enzymes<00:03:24.440> were<00:03:24.950> added<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.549> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
DNA digesting enzymes were added to it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.199 
DNA digesting enzymes were added to it
the<00:03:26.180> transforming<00:03:26.840> principle<00:03:27.380> was

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
the transforming principle was

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
the transforming principle was
inactivated<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.690> means<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.109> was<00:03:30.320> DNA<00:03:30.920> so

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
inactivated so that means it was DNA so

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.150 
inactivated so that means it was DNA so
this<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.880> how<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.359> was<00:03:32.570> observed<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
this is how it was observed that the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.490 
this is how it was observed that the
genetic<00:03:35.120> material<00:03:35.600> or<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.870> material<00:03:36.380> that

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
genetic material or the material that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.240 
genetic material or the material that
passes<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.160> from<00:03:37.519> one<00:03:38.799> organism<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:40.100> another

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
passes on from one organism to another

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.680 
passes on from one organism to another
organism<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:41.480> nothing<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:41.840> DN<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:44.239> DNA

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
organism that is nothing but DN a so DNA

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.810 
organism that is nothing but DN a so DNA
is<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.109> genetic<00:03:45.140> material<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.609> was

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
is the genetic material so this was

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.910 
is the genetic material so this was
finally<00:03:47.060> proved<00:03:47.570> after<00:03:48.320> Griffin's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
finally proved after Griffin's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.130 
finally proved after Griffin's
experiment<00:03:49.700> when<00:03:50.180> Griffith<00:03:50.660> defined

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
experiment when Griffith defined
