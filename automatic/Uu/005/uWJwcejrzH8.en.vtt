00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
I have not done this tank hasn't been

cleaned in some time going to take this
off<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.950> tripod<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> tank<00:02:45.500> hasn't

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829

been cleaned in a while so there's

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.720 
been cleaned in a while so there's
actually<00:02:48.049> coralline<00:02:48.530> algae<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
actually coralline algae it's going to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.259 
actually coralline algae it's going to
be<00:02:49.819> hard<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.090> see<00:02:50.359> growing<00:02:51.230> on<00:02:51.760> your<00:02:52.760> summer<00:02:53.090> in

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
be hard to see growing on your summer in

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.369 
be hard to see growing on your summer in
here<00:02:55.269> coralline<00:02:56.269> algae<00:02:56.299> all<00:02:56.750> down<00:02:56.959> here<00:02:57.200> it's

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
here coralline algae all down here it's

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.020 
here coralline algae all down here it's
growing<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.040> front<00:02:58.280> glass<00:02:58.430> um<00:03:01.030> another

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
growing on the front glass um another

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.339 
growing on the front glass um another
interesting<00:03:02.359> fact<00:03:02.930> tidbit<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.370> this

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
interesting fact tidbit is that this

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.960 
interesting fact tidbit is that this
tube<00:03:06.349> quarrels<00:03:06.920> or<00:03:07.069> whatever<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.730> there

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
tube quarrels or whatever that is there

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.660 
tube quarrels or whatever that is there
they<00:03:08.780> seem<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.079> catch<00:03:09.409> a<00:03:09.650> lot<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.829> debris<00:03:10.190> so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
they seem to catch a lot of debris so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.309 
they seem to catch a lot of debris so
what<00:03:10.879> happens<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.389> I<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.629> some<00:03:11.900> cyano

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
what happens is I have some cyano

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.360 
what happens is I have some cyano
growing<00:03:12.799> on<00:03:12.950> there<00:03:14.319> which<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.530> kind<00:03:15.859> of<00:03:16.040> weird

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
growing on there which is kind of weird

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.900 
growing on there which is kind of weird
because<00:03:16.639> it's<00:03:16.970> right<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.389> front<00:03:17.419> of<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.870> mp40

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
because it's right in front of the mp40

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.569 
because it's right in front of the mp40
or<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.379> think<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.949> everything<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.430> we

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
or and you think that everything that we

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.300 
or and you think that everything that we
read<00:03:22.819> is<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.090> low<00:03:23.480> flow<00:03:23.810> causes<00:03:24.379> this<00:03:24.530> cyano

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
read is that low flow causes this cyano

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610 
read is that low flow causes this cyano
to<00:03:25.489> grow<00:03:25.699> but<00:03:25.940> let<00:03:26.629> me<00:03:26.660> tell<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.989> it's<00:03:27.379> right

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
to grow but let me tell you it's right

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.259 
to grow but let me tell you it's right
in<00:03:27.709> front<00:03:27.949> there<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.370> growing<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:29.060> can

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
in front there and it's growing you can

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.770 
in front there and it's growing you can
actually<00:03:29.419> see<00:03:29.629> it<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:32.060> can<00:03:32.209> actually<00:03:32.359> see<00:03:32.540> it

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actually see it you can actually see it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.580 
actually see it you can actually see it
moving<00:03:33.049> around<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.750> two<00:03:35.900> corals<00:03:36.319> just

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
moving around and the two corals just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.280 
moving around and the two corals just
making<00:03:36.919> it<00:03:37.010> stick<00:03:37.190> right<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.639> it<00:03:37.840> over<00:03:38.840> here<00:03:39.169> at

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
making it stick right to it over here at

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.729 
making it stick right to it over here at
the<00:03:39.379> upper<00:03:39.650> part<00:03:39.889> of<00:03:39.949> the<00:03:40.010> tank<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:42.530> some

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
the upper part of the tank I have some

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.619 
the upper part of the tank I have some
coralline<00:03:43.160> algae<00:03:43.190> growing<00:03:43.760> off<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> clam<00:03:44.359> back

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
coralline algae growing off a clam back

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.569 
coralline algae growing off a clam back
there<00:03:44.900> things<00:03:45.560> covered<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.190> rock<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
clam yeah I not coraline cyanobacteria

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.610 
clam yeah I not coraline cyanobacteria
that's<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.989> meant<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.199> say<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.530> that

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
that's what I meant to say in that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.400 
that's what I meant to say in that
coralline<00:03:52.010> algae<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.810> have<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.109> get<00:03:54.230> rid<00:03:54.379> of

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
coralline algae so I have to get rid of

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.089 
coralline algae so I have to get rid of
that<00:03:55.750> got<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> bunch<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.109> coraline<00:03:57.500> growing<00:03:57.949> on

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
that got a bunch of coraline growing on

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.869 
that got a bunch of coraline growing on
my<00:03:58.340> safe<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.180> tube<00:03:59.329> for<00:03:59.599> my<00:03:59.829> fluval<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:01.699> is

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
my safe and tube for my fluval this is

just<00:04:16.789> did<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.060> review<00:04:17.570> on<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.709> reef<00:04:18.889> light

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
just did a review on this the reef light

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.279 
just did a review on this the reef light
I<00:04:19.400> only<00:04:20.299> bought<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.780> because<00:04:20.989> the

I only bought this because the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.629 
I only bought this because the

fluorescent like that i was using that

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.510 
fluorescent like that i was using that
came<00:04:22.909> with<00:04:23.090> us<00:04:23.240> was<00:04:23.510> horrible<00:04:23.990> so

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
came with us was horrible so

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.800 
came with us was horrible so
I<00:04:24.610> figured<00:04:25.060> this<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.300> be<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.449> little<00:04:25.629> bit

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
I figured this would be a little bit

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.719 
I figured this would be a little bit
better<00:04:25.900> actually<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:26.830> adds<00:04:27.129> quite<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.490> bit<00:04:27.639> of

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
better actually it adds quite a bit of

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.029 
better actually it adds quite a bit of
shimmer<00:04:27.849> effect<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.509> don't<00:04:28.960> have<00:04:29.110> any<00:04:29.259> SPSS<00:04:29.889> in

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
shimmer effect I don't have any SPSS in

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.230 
shimmer effect I don't have any SPSS in
here<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:30.550> not<00:04:30.669> having<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.000> worry<00:04:31.060> about

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
here so I'm not having to worry about

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.779 
here so I'm not having to worry about
any<00:04:31.479> growth<00:04:31.750> or<00:04:31.900> anything<00:04:32.139> like<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.610> for

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
any growth or anything like that so for

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.680 
any growth or anything like that so for
what<00:04:33.909> I'm<00:04:34.030> using<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.449> for<00:04:34.629> it's<00:04:34.720> working<00:04:35.050> fine

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
what I'm using it for it's working fine

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.480 
what I'm using it for it's working fine
here's<00:04:37.770> something<00:04:38.770> else<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.190> saw<00:04:39.430> is

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
here's something else that I saw is

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.550 
here's something else that I saw is
there's<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:42.659> where<00:04:43.659> the<00:04:43.840> protein<00:04:44.259> skimmer

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
there's the where the protein skimmer

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.430 
there's the where the protein skimmer
dumps<00:04:44.919> into<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.129> tank<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:47.110> know<00:04:47.169> it's<00:04:47.349> hard

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
dumps into the tank and I know it's hard

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.969 
dumps into the tank and I know it's hard
to<00:04:47.530> see<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.860> light<00:04:48.039> shine<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.340> but<00:04:48.789> there

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
to see the light shine on but there

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.950 
to see the light shine on but there
there's<00:04:50.979> even<00:04:51.120> cyanobacteria<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.750> Harry

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
there's even cyanobacteria and Harry

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.249 
there's even cyanobacteria and Harry
algae<00:04:53.289> growing<00:04:53.560> on<00:04:54.810> if<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:55.900> can<00:04:56.020> give<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.229> a

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
algae growing on if I can give you a

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.580 
algae growing on if I can give you a
better<00:04:56.409> look<00:04:58.710> growing<00:04:59.710> on<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:01.470> where<00:05:02.470> the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
better look growing on the where the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.879 
better look growing on the where the
water<00:05:02.800> comes<00:05:03.099> out<00:05:04.169> there<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.289> go<00:05:05.409> you<00:05:05.470> can<00:05:05.680> see

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
water comes out there you go you can see

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
water comes out there you go you can see
it<00:05:06.180> it's<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> bunch<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:07.569> cyano<00:05:08.409> there<00:05:08.909> there's

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
it it's a bunch of cyano there there's

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.260 
it it's a bunch of cyano there there's
some<00:05:10.090> hair<00:05:10.300> algae<00:05:10.569> growing<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:12.090> won't<00:05:13.090> be<00:05:13.180> able

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
some hair algae growing I won't be able

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.089 
some hair algae growing I won't be able
to<00:05:13.360> see<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.919> aqueon<00:05:15.280> back<00:05:15.639> there<00:05:15.909> and

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.379 

yeah<00:05:21.099> this<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.639> won't<00:05:21.759> be<00:05:21.909> able<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.210> see

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
yeah this you won't be able to see

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.200 
yeah this you won't be able to see
either<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:22.960> I<00:05:23.699> thought<00:05:24.699> this<00:05:24.849> was<00:05:25.030> pretty

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
either but I thought this was pretty

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.920 
either but I thought this was pretty
interesting<00:05:26.219> my<00:05:27.219> protein<00:05:27.789> skimmer<00:05:28.180> actually

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
interesting my protein skimmer actually

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.200 
interesting my protein skimmer actually
has<00:05:29.139> these<00:05:29.440> little<00:05:29.740> um<00:05:30.099> I<00:05:32.849> don't<00:05:33.849> know<00:05:34.000> what

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
has these little um I don't know what

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.129 
has these little um I don't know what
you<00:05:34.240> call<00:05:34.360> them<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:36.539> little<00:05:37.539> white<00:05:37.719> cocoon

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
you call them the little white cocoon

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.719 
you call them the little white cocoon
things<00:05:38.469> they're<00:05:38.740> like<00:05:38.949> the<00:05:39.069> third<00:05:39.370> almost

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
things they're like the third almost

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.339 
things they're like the third almost
like<00:05:39.849> feather<00:05:40.090> dusters<00:05:40.509> growing<00:05:41.469> inside

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
like feather dusters growing inside

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.309 
like feather dusters growing inside
between<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.469> two<00:05:45.509> plastic<00:05:46.509> pieces<00:05:46.960> of<00:05:47.259> the

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
between the two plastic pieces of the

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.499 
between the two plastic pieces of the
protein<00:05:47.710> skimmer<00:05:47.949> nerds<00:05:48.190> actually<00:05:48.699> if<00:05:49.419> I

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
protein skimmer nerds actually if I

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.820 
protein skimmer nerds actually if I
could<00:05:49.659> show<00:05:49.779> you<00:05:49.810> up<00:05:50.020> close<00:05:50.050> but<00:05:50.500> there's

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
could show you up close but there's

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.640 
could show you up close but there's
actually<00:05:51.279> amphipods<00:05:51.880> in<00:05:52.090> there<00:05:52.270> um<00:05:52.500> that<00:05:53.500> was

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
actually amphipods in there um that was

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.230 
actually amphipods in there um that was
kind<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.949> weird<00:05:54.099> so<00:05:54.370> what<00:05:54.550> I'm<00:05:54.639> going<00:05:54.789> to<00:05:54.849> do<00:05:55.000> is

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
kind of weird so what I'm going to do is

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.330 
kind of weird so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:55.990> in<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.229> process<00:05:56.409> of<00:05:56.770> cleaning<00:05:56.979> all<00:05:57.219> my

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
I'm in the process of cleaning all my

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.100 
I'm in the process of cleaning all my
equipment<00:05:57.759> for<00:05:57.880> my<00:05:57.969> 72<00:05:58.389> gallons<00:05:58.719> so<00:05:58.840> i<00:05:58.870> am

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
equipment for my 72 gallons so i am

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.040 
equipment for my 72 gallons so i am
going<00:05:59.349> to<00:05:59.469> empty<00:06:00.190> this<00:06:00.340> system<00:06:00.819> put<00:06:01.779> it<00:06:01.870> into

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
going to empty this system put it into

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.200 
going to empty this system put it into
my<00:06:02.169> sump<00:06:02.469> put<00:06:03.159> the<00:06:03.250> fishes<00:06:03.580> in<00:06:03.610> there<00:06:03.909> and<00:06:04.120> the

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
my sump put the fishes in there and the

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.570 
my sump put the fishes in there and the
inverts<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:04.719> everything<00:06:05.310> clean<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.430> up<00:06:06.550> clean

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
inverts and everything clean it up clean

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.760 
inverts and everything clean it up clean
this<00:06:07.090> tank<00:06:07.389> all<00:06:07.569> out<00:06:07.779> add<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.169> scene<00:06:08.409> but<00:06:08.650> the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
this tank all out add the scene but the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.170 
this tank all out add the scene but the
rocks<00:06:08.949> back<00:06:09.190> in<00:06:09.400> try<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.639> make<00:06:09.819> a<00:06:09.849> little<00:06:10.090> bit

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
rocks back in try to make a little bit

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.670 
rocks back in try to make a little bit
nicer<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:12.210> go<00:06:13.210> from<00:06:13.389> there<00:06:13.569> so<00:06:13.630> that's<00:06:14.409> what's

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
nicer and go from there so that's what's

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.580 
nicer and go from there so that's what's
been<00:06:14.770> going<00:06:15.099> on<00:06:15.190> with<00:06:15.400> me<00:06:16.409> just<00:06:17.409> been<00:06:17.560> busy

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
is I'll put up another video after I'm

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.769 
is I'll put up another video after I'm
done<00:06:28.900> cleaning<00:06:29.169> this<00:06:29.529> tank<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.039> I<00:06:30.759> have<00:06:31.150> a<00:06:31.180> the

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779
