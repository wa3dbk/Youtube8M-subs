 I'm Constable Ichabod Crane. 

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.000
 They sent me from New York to investigate the murders in Sleepy Hole. 

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.500
 How much did your superiors tell you? 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.500
 Only that the three were killed in the open 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.000
 and their heads were ... separated from their bodies. 

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:42.000
 Taken by the headless rider. Taken back to hell. 

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:49.000
 He used to ride a giant black horse. And who saw him was freezing blood in his veins. 

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:55.000
 Even today, the western forests are a frightening place not even brave men will go. 

00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:01.000
 We have murderers in New York without the contribution of ghouls and goblins. 

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.670
 You're far from New York, Constable ... 11 00: 01: 05,801 -&gt; 00: 01: 08,200 Is everyone in this village just talking about superstitions? 

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.000
 We have a lot to talk about, even in this backcountry. 

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.200
 - Excuse me, I'm not used to ... - Women's company? 

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:18.500
 Murder! Rider kills again !! 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.300
 Our killer is a man of flesh and bones, and I find him. 

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.500
 Are you all so sure? 

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.500
 - Maybe there's a witch in you, Katrina. - Why do you say that? 

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.502
 Because you charmed me.
