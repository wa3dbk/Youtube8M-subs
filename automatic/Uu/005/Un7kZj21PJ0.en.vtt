00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
scope as well something that's an

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.249

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
structural damage there

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.620 
structural damage there
aha<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.400> can<00:01:30.640> win<00:01:30.759> free<00:01:31.000> pieces<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.540> the

season<00:01:35.170> seven<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:37.079> mean<00:01:38.079> I'm<00:01:38.229> gonna<00:01:38.320> go<00:01:38.590> for

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829

season seven I mean I'm gonna go for
that<00:01:38.920> actually<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.610> don't<00:01:40.149> think<00:01:40.360> that's

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
that actually I don't think that's

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.050 
that actually I don't think that's
particularly<00:01:42.000> brilliant<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.509> white<00:01:43.689> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.730 

it's<00:01:49.060> not<00:01:49.240> pieces<00:01:49.719> it's<00:01:49.869> not<00:01:50.020> material<00:01:50.469> to

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
it's not pieces it's not material to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.679 
it's not pieces it's not material to
give<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.899> win<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.140> queen<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
give up just to win my queen so the

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.330 
give up just to win my queen so the
question<00:01:56.020> now<00:01:56.049> is<00:01:56.140> coordination<00:01:56.649> as<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.159> big

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
question now is coordination as the big

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.240 
question now is coordination as the big
priority<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.689> pieces<00:01:59.020> coordinate<00:01:59.500> well

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
priority can the pieces coordinate well

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.839 
priority can the pieces coordinate well
together<00:02:00.430> as<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.759> team<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:01.619> um<00:02:06.450> let's<00:02:07.450> see

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
together as a team so um let's see

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.339 
together as a team so um let's see
he's<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.689> to<00:02:09.750> play<00:02:09.869> D<00:02:10.170> takes<00:02:10.469> 1895<00:02:12.079> might

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:22.369 

think<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.469> can<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.739> way<00:02:16.829> this<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:18.530> hope<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:21.379> ok

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
think I can get way this I hope I can ok

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.280 
think I can get way this I hope I can ok
he's<00:02:22.560> weakened<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.129> background<00:02:23.549> temporarily

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
he's weakened my background temporarily

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
he's weakened my background temporarily
but<00:02:25.290> Queens<00:02:25.620> e8<00:02:25.890> rook<00:02:26.159> F<00:02:26.310> 8<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.909> then

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
but Queens e8 rook F 8 and then then

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.020 
but Queens e8 rook F 8 and then then
what<00:02:27.359> happens<00:02:28.069> Bishop<00:02:29.069> f6<00:02:29.189> maybe<00:02:29.579> Bishop<00:02:29.909> f6

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
what happens Bishop f6 maybe Bishop f6

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.470 
what happens Bishop f6 maybe Bishop f6
line<00:02:30.420> protecting<00:02:30.750> d8<00:02:32.000> maybe<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.209> I'm<00:02:33.359> gonna

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
line protecting d8 maybe then I'm gonna

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.300 
line protecting d8 maybe then I'm gonna
Queen<00:02:33.870> d5<00:02:34.260> though<00:02:34.909> pinning<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.030> rook

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
Queen d5 though pinning the rook

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.099 
Queen d5 though pinning the rook
so<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> question<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.879> maybe<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.599> maybe<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.870> just

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
so the question is maybe it maybe I just

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.690 
so the question is maybe it maybe I just
move<00:02:40.290> my<00:02:40.319> M<00:02:41.359> on<00:02:42.359> Bishop<00:02:42.689> out<00:02:43.430> ok<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.459> think<00:02:44.579> it's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
move my M on Bishop out ok I think it's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.240 
move my M on Bishop out ok I think it's
probably<00:02:44.970> worth<00:02:45.239> protecting

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
probably worth protecting

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.539 
probably worth protecting
ace<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.970> b5<00:02:48.419> port<00:02:50.209> if<00:02:51.209> I've<00:02:51.329> got<00:02:51.510> time<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
ace the b5 port if I've got time and

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:00.080 
ace the b5 port if I've got time and
I'll<00:02:53.549> play<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> six<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:58.669> some<00:02:59.669> points<00:02:59.909> to<00:03:00.000> try

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
I'll play a six and some points to try

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
I'll play a six and some points to try
and<00:03:00.180> kick<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.510> Bishop<00:03:00.900> maybe<00:03:01.139> if<00:03:02.069> I'm<00:03:02.159> gonna

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and kick this Bishop maybe if I'm gonna

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
and kick this Bishop maybe if I'm gonna
play<00:03:02.370> Bishop<00:03:02.609> f5<00:03:03.980> actually<00:03:09.230> about<00:03:10.230> losing

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
play Bishop f5 actually about losing

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.729 
play Bishop f5 actually about losing
material<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:12.389> then<00:03:12.659> some<00:03:12.989> connecting<00:03:13.650> my

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
material and then some connecting my

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.649 
material and then some connecting my
routes<00:03:13.979> potentially<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.940> other<00:03:15.030> work<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.389> f4

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
routes potentially the other work to f4

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.490 
routes potentially the other work to f4
8<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.849> should<00:03:18.120> start<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.479> be<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.599> bit<00:03:18.659> more

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500

h5 so just to protect that rook when I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.240 
h5 so just to protect that rook when I
for<00:04:12.120> seven<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.479> I<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.689> play<00:04:12.840> rook<00:04:13.019> if<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.040> in

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
for seven and I can play rook if I in

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.379 
for seven and I can play rook if I in
fight<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.639> I<00:04:14.669> don't<00:04:14.819> want<00:04:14.939> to<00:04:14.970> lose<00:04:15.120> even<00:04:15.269> that

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
fight but I don't want to lose even that

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.099 
fight but I don't want to lose even that
b7<00:04:16.019> 4<00:04:16.229> -<00:04:17.000> but<00:04:18.000> unless<00:04:18.299> it's<00:04:18.510> worth<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.900> which<00:04:19.019> I

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
b7 4 - but unless it's worth it which I

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.479 
b7 4 - but unless it's worth it which I
think<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:20.010> should<00:04:20.519> be

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
think it it should be

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.439 
think it it should be
okay<00:04:21.819> I<00:04:21.849> have<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.120> move<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.419> back<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:25.240> I'm<00:04:25.300> not

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
okay I have to move that back so I'm not

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.670 
okay I have to move that back so I'm not
not<00:04:25.840> losing<00:04:26.110> any<00:04:26.410> material<00:04:26.740> back<00:04:26.919> yet<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:28.680> could

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
not losing any material back yet I could

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.350 
not losing any material back yet I could
actually<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:29.979> try<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> unpin<00:04:30.669> this<00:04:30.819> rook<00:04:31.060> if

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
actually just try to unpin this rook if

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.700 
actually just try to unpin this rook if
rook<00:04:32.319> d7<00:04:32.470> isn't<00:04:33.099> played<00:04:34.199> but<00:04:35.199> if<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.500> played

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
rook d7 isn't played but if it is played

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.360 
rook d7 isn't played but if it is played
rook<00:04:35.889> IFA<00:04:36.280> rook<00:04:36.580> takes<00:04:36.759> b7<00:04:37.330> then<00:04:37.479> maybe<00:04:37.720> King

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
rook IFA rook takes b7 then maybe King

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.890 
rook IFA rook takes b7 then maybe King
h8<00:04:42.660> my<00:04:43.660> hand<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.380> don't<00:04:44.470> know<00:04:44.940> about<00:04:45.940> just<00:04:46.300> b6

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
h8 my hand I don't know about just b6

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.309 
h8 my hand I don't know about just b6
for<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.500> moment<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.990> see<00:04:50.139> what<00:04:50.169> the

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
for the moment to see what the

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.390 
for the moment to see what the
opponent's<00:04:50.680> doing<00:04:50.889> here

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
opponent's doing here

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.430 
opponent's doing here
I<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:52.300> know<00:04:52.389> activating<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.020> brook<00:04:53.229> though

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
I don't know activating the brook though

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.129 
I don't know activating the brook though
it<00:04:53.500> seems<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.919> seems<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.159> logical<00:04:54.310> move<00:04:54.639> as<00:04:54.759> well

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
it seems it seems a logical move as well

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:12.320 
it seems it seems a logical move as well
so<00:04:56.139> maybe<00:04:56.289> c8<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.889> one<00:05:02.039> so<00:05:03.039> Brooke<00:05:03.250> b7<00:05:09.960> yeah

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
so maybe c8 so one so Brooke b7 yeah

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:20.430 
so maybe c8 so one so Brooke b7 yeah
it's<00:05:13.330> good<00:05:13.479> question<00:05:13.840> from<00:05:14.139> c7<00:05:16.830> k<00:05:17.830> f8<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:19.440> then

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
it's good question from c7 k f8 and then

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.339 
it's good question from c7 k f8 and then
Queen<00:05:20.740> before<00:05:21.069> Bishop<00:05:21.190> e7<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:22.050> I'll<00:05:23.050> try<00:05:23.289> this

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
Queen before Bishop e7 and I'll try this

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.300 
Queen before Bishop e7 and I'll try this
just<00:05:23.710> unpin<00:05:24.340> try<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.360> get<00:05:25.449> this<00:05:25.539> rook<00:05:25.810> walking

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.070 

so<00:05:30.310> queenly<00:05:30.669> for<00:05:30.849> Bishop<00:05:31.120> e7<00:05:31.479> becomes

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
so queenly for Bishop e7 becomes

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.499 
so queenly for Bishop e7 becomes
possible<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.740> don't<00:05:33.250> like<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.520> pin<00:05:33.940> there's

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
possible I don't like this pin there's

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.810 
possible I don't like this pin there's
an<00:05:34.630> expression<00:05:34.900> pin<00:05:35.229> on<00:05:35.409> win<00:05:35.590> it's<00:05:36.550> kind<00:05:36.729> of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
an expression pin on win it's kind of

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.490 
an expression pin on win it's kind of
vicious<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.509> use<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.810> pin<00:05:38.020> all<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.259> time

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
vicious to use that pin all the time

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.950 
vicious to use that pin all the time

Bishop<00:05:52.150> c5<00:05:52.509> next<00:05:52.960> whatever<00:05:53.440> happens<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:54.009> might

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
Bishop c5 next whatever happens I might

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.420 
Bishop c5 next whatever happens I might
be<00:05:54.849> winning<00:05:54.969> this<00:05:55.180> rook<00:05:56.069> so<00:05:57.069> that's<00:05:57.219> why<00:05:57.400> I

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
be winning this rook so that's why I

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.740 
be winning this rook so that's why I
think<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.699> three<00:05:57.880> pieces<00:05:58.090> are<00:05:58.330> coordinating

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
think the three pieces are coordinating

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.200 
think the three pieces are coordinating
multicolored<00:05:59.199> these<00:05:59.409> two<00:05:59.650> and<00:06:00.280> are<00:06:00.460> friends

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
multicolored these two and are friends

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.770 
multicolored these two and are friends
with<00:06:01.300> each<00:06:01.360> other

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
with each other

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.860 
with each other
so<00:06:02.110> okay<00:06:02.440> rook<00:06:02.590> takes<00:06:02.969> so<00:06:03.969> I<00:06:04.000> material<00:06:04.479> up<00:06:04.630> now

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
so okay rook takes so I material up now

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.129 
so okay rook takes so I material up now
clearly<00:06:06.270> it's<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.330> kind<00:06:07.509> of<00:06:07.569> Bishop<00:06:07.870> work<00:06:08.020> with

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
clearly it's a kind of Bishop work with

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.740 
clearly it's a kind of Bishop work with
the<00:06:08.199> two<00:06:08.380> rules

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.750 

right<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.680> don't<00:06:13.950> want<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.130> just<00:06:14.280> distantly

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
right I don't want to just distantly

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.570 
right I don't want to just distantly
grab<00:06:15.060> material<00:06:15.540> without<00:06:15.720> them<00:06:15.900> coordinating

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
grab material without them coordinating

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.330 
grab material without them coordinating
