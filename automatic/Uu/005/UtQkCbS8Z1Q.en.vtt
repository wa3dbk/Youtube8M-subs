00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.349
 now 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.349
 the sabadell and athlete of the air people 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.640
 the truth that pretty good because 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.469
 all the objectives that we have 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
 marked so far are being met 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.820
 both nationally and at the level 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 European objective was to reach the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.530
 final four and the truth is that one more year 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.149
 we have it again in the phase 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 previous in the groups we did the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.479
 work that we have to do we stay 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 group measures then we get a 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.489
 rival more affordable and once there in your 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.379
 house we also knew how to mark the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.379
 difference and take that income from 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.840
 goals and good now that's going to think the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.789
 'Final four' already in the william men and that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.619
 is the team that has touched us the truth 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.840
 is that this year we are we are 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.280
 gathering enough because both league 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.720
 world in between and we have already left 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.679
 gathering a lot and the truth is that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.210
 pretty good we are a group of 18 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.560
 players we all know each other 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.929
 we all get along very well and that is 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.789
 note also in the water and always 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.920
 It's nice to work with all of them and 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.390
 re-raise and the truth is yes 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.100
 now everyone is with good in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.040
 barcelona the gold then there is also that 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.230
 think that they are more selections than 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.930
 that the Olympics here are 16 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.730
 elections and that there are teams that are very 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.370
 hard, obviously, we're going to 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.470
 give everything the same as we did in london and 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.900
 what we are going to do is go step by step and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.030
 rival to rival and try to get as much 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.580
 high possible the truth and it is a little what 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.340
 what mike said to also be the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.410
 country is not going through a good time 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.850
 and it shows a lot in sports about 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.520
 all in minority sports as is the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 water polo but we are 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 training day by day we are giving it 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.670
 all with the same illusion to be able 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.399
 take this forward because it was in the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 Mediterranean 'doing courses that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.200
 they wanted to assemble a team of everything from 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.700
 little girls and then they were 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.010
 catching people to go testing and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 the rest 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.930
 and I started I started to introduce in this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 world they told me you is that is the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.000
 goalkeeper for your body because I know that if 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.340
 you have the way it was and I started to get 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 in the goal began to like not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.290
 I had nothing was quietly 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.709
 and so far right now that you enjoy 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.569
 of water polo and never give up that 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.109
 obviously it's going to happen as bad 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.519
 moments but as we have all passed and 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.590
 surely we will have to live many more 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.450
 but above all, never give up 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 move forward and mark a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.790
 objective 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.610
 my life is already everything is there 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.920
 It's water polo 24 hours a day because it 's a 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.409
 my friends are water polo people we are 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.910
 a family and the truth that water polo 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.280
 in my life 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.550
 the Olympic gold and if it can be the river 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550
 green
