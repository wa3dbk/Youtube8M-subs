not<00:02:28.430> impressed<00:02:28.880> with<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.630> overall<00:02:29.660> look<00:02:30.380> of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
not impressed with the overall look of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
not impressed with the overall look of
this<00:02:30.709> figure<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.549> just<00:02:31.790> doesn't<00:02:32.329> feel<00:02:32.599> very

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
this figure it just doesn't feel very

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.069 
this figure it just doesn't feel very
sturdy<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:34.250> very<00:02:34.370> thin<00:02:34.879> very<00:02:35.060> wobbly<00:02:35.540> not

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
sturdy it's very thin very wobbly not

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.780 
sturdy it's very thin very wobbly not
much<00:02:36.230> playability<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:37.010> don't<00:02:37.459> personally

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
much playability I don't personally

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.930 
much playability I don't personally
think<00:02:38.090> um<00:02:38.829> if<00:02:39.829> her<00:02:40.100> legs<00:02:40.370> were<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.609> little<00:02:40.760> bit

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
think um if her legs were a little bit

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330 
think um if her legs were a little bit
better<00:02:41.139> she<00:02:42.139> could<00:02:42.260> actually<00:02:42.380> stand<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.220> her

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
better she could actually stand on her

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.629 
better she could actually stand on her
legs<00:02:43.370> without<00:02:43.940> them<00:02:44.590> hop<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.799> forward<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.430> mean

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
legs without them hop and forward I mean

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.660 
legs without them hop and forward I mean
like<00:02:46.819> if<00:02:47.000> she<00:02:47.120> could<00:02:47.269> do<00:02:47.359> this<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:48.549> mean<00:02:49.549> this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
like if she could do this I mean this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.240 
like if she could do this I mean this
isn't<00:02:49.880> bad<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.389> got<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> heels<00:02:51.739> closed<00:02:52.010> off

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
isn't bad I got the heels closed off

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
isn't bad I got the heels closed off
kind<00:02:52.609> of<00:02:52.760> maybe<00:02:53.209> I'll<00:02:53.359> glue<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.840> heel<00:02:54.079> or

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
kind of maybe I'll glue the heel or

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.879 
kind of maybe I'll glue the heel or
something<00:02:54.739> I<00:02:54.920> don't<00:02:54.980> know<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.889> mean

something I don't know but I mean

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.800 
something I don't know but I mean
overall<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.430> not<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.639> horrendous<00:02:59.269> figure<00:02:59.600> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
overall it's not a horrendous figure I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.190 
overall it's not a horrendous figure I
am<00:03:00.470> NOT<00:03:01.329> going<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:02.359> recommend<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.079> unless

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200

actually but I did only pay retail price
for<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.590> being<00:03:37.830> said<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.459> guess<00:03:38.819> you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
for it so that being said I guess you

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.059 
for it so that being said I guess you
can't<00:03:39.120> complain<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.599> ten<00:03:39.930> dollars<00:03:40.080> but<00:03:40.890> her

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
can't complain about ten dollars but her

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.610 
can't complain about ten dollars but her
pose<00:03:41.280> ability<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.940> limited<00:03:42.420> by<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.290> way<00:03:43.470> her

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
pose ability is limited by the way her

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.479 
pose ability is limited by the way her
retarded<00:03:44.010> legs<00:03:44.780> function<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:49.590> that's<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
retarded legs function but that's it so

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.309 
retarded legs function but that's it so
to<00:03:50.760> transform<00:03:51.180> her<00:03:51.330> back<00:03:51.540> what<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.080> want<00:03:52.230> to

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
to transform her back what you want to

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.500 
to transform her back what you want to
do<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.620> again<00:03:53.069> rotate<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.420> shin<00:03:55.140> plates<00:03:56.510> so

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
do here again rotate the shin plates so

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.490 
do here again rotate the shin plates so
that<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.930> knee<00:03:58.319> will<00:03:59.069> become<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.459> tip<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.030> her

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
that the knee will become the tip of her

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.380 
that the knee will become the tip of her
spiderleg<00:04:02.239> quite<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:05.209> lifts<00:04:06.209> her<00:04:06.360> arm

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
spiderleg quite like that lifts her arm

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.809 
spiderleg quite like that lifts her arm
just<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.049> get<00:04:07.140> those<00:04:07.290> out<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.620> way

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
just going to get those out of the way

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.949 
just going to get those out of the way
spin<00:04:08.819> these<00:04:09.060> little<00:04:09.390> doodads<00:04:09.780> out<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.840> like

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
spin these little doodads out just like

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.949 
spin these little doodads out just like
so<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:14.599> then<00:04:15.599> rotate<00:04:16.260> these<00:04:16.590> little<00:04:17.959> spider

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
so and then rotate these little spider

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.810 
so and then rotate these little spider
things<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.220> front<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:22.190> rotate<00:04:23.190> those<00:04:23.370> it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
things to the front and rotate those it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.170 
things to the front and rotate those it
all<00:04:23.970> into<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.360> front<00:04:25.729> come<00:04:26.729> around<00:04:26.820> here<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
all into the front come around here to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.850 
all into the front come around here to
the<00:04:27.270> back<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.870> you're<00:04:28.110> going<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.560> bring

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.640 

yeah<00:04:36.610> position<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.449> little<00:04:37.719> bit<00:04:37.930> trickily

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
yeah position this a little bit trickily
