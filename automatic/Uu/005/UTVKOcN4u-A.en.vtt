00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.250
 My name is James Grant and I'm from Glasgow, Scotland. I call myself SweetWaveAudio 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.490
 and I create for Pond5. 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200
 I'm a drummer. I've always played in a band since I was 12 years old 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.860
 and I always enjoyed making music, but I'm not singing 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.920
 so I always composed instrumental songs. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.800
 One friend gave me a piece of paper where Pond5 was written and said: 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.240
 "Look at this website, you can make money there." 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.900
 I had no idea what this stock audio or stock media was. So I'm the next day 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 he came home and looked at it and told myself to try it. Someone bought mine 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.859
 a song and I felt like I won a Sportce, and I thought this would be my job. 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.439
 In three years, thanks to my hard work, I have done it, so I'm happy! 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.340
 Thanks to stock and Pond5 I could buy some nice musical toys. 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.580
 Also, the musician's complete novelty can go on vacation or somewhere on a trip 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.659
 while revenues do not decline and do not stop. Pond5 can still make money in the background 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.059
 it's like rent, which is a totally unknown concept for all the musicians I know 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.660
 so I'm pretty lucky. Thanks for that, Pond5! 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.440
 If anyone wanted to start creating stock music, I'd say 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.700
 The most important thing is to play what you want. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.820
 Find out what you're best at, and compose the music of this genre first 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.200
 maybe you have one or two genres best for you. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.160
 And don't get down to specific songs. 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.860
 If you record a song you love and nobody buys it, don't be unhappy. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.060
 Just upload it, almost forget it and start composing more. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.000
 My approach is that everything will be fine. I stick to that and so far it has always been. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.020
 In addition to royalty-free music for Pond5 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.520
 I would also like to compose music for film and television, such things. 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.800
 And I also work on a "device" that will brainwash all Pond5 customers 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.760
 to buy music only from me. So just after I finish the prototype, 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.940
 I'll put it on the internet and take over the world. 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.920
 Buy my songs!
