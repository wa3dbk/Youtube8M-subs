00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.230
 Peter Wegner 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.450
 old the game is so exaggerated 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.610
 bad oh such a nonsense 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.939
 as if you knew what I'm talking about 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.070
 a game, yes, but not any 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 play this is dead space 3 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 what is so bad about it now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:41.070
 it got him something let it me that way 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.769
 express 120 this company great that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.470
 now she is just horribly doing mine 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.640
 just play broke I can not do that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
 understand 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.369
 sing first fsc and cedars dead space 3 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.369
 the good times are over 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.589
 I was really looking forward to it 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.119
 now even judge is not important if 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.650
 he hardly a year of 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.720
 I freak out then I throw these 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.339
 soup from decision I install 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.830
 not that never comes here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.479
 the games should be bigger and because 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.430
 more content and then come there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.880
 usually never not the head me so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.130
 on 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 and that the systems are already annoying 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.079
 alone microtransactions go here 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.850
 just make it worse and the tlz the 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.619
 disturb because they do not belong yet 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.490
 brings something out too fast and so fast 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.659
 then usually so expensive 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:33.109
 Otherwise, play with too many 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.470
 action like are just stupid because 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:41.490
 Risk is what it really is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.220
 you do not think dance is great either 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.400
 and yes, if I do something now 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.560
 tell me that was really great 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.020
 The games are just wonderful 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.540
 I the deconsecrated today and puts 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.160
 it was this horror qual today is mine 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.320
 the fucking shit not even that at 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.630
 craig will go soon 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.730
 But the best he still experiences 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.290
 out of every hole the adversaries from there 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.000
 this attacked you are the author of that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.770
 Worst work is still the same 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.840
 so I believe a piece of lungs but what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.290
 will bring me will ask 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.930
 so now comes that when you come down 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.510
 no matter if day or night 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.520
 you need to log in it yet 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.500
 important, but why is that? 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.500
 so bad these days 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:44.950
 8 also not easy that was really 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 wonderful where there is point deduction in the b 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 Note the text does not really exist 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.680
 you do not find it fitting to tune well 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.989
 besides, you're pretty 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.190
 strong from the clock to that comes yet 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.450
 you really do not sing at all 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.040
 I can not do that already 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.540
 But that was really on a scale 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.160
 from 1 to 10 I would give you one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.630
 give generous 7 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.190
 simply because that's your first 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.610
 I was really good 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.319
 were entertained 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.160
 just not another one of mine 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.610
 That 's clear, melodies 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.610
 um, sorry
