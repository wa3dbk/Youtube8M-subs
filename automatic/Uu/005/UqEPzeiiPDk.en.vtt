00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.119
 January 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.709

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.689
 the tax island 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.050
 during the landing when you are late to get to know the famous tourist spot 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:24.980
 but who arrives 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.010
 neither can you imagine the history that the castle and the island said 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.890
 it was here on November 9, 1889 that the Chilean ship docked at the docks 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 right here in guanabara bay 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 on the occasion the Viscount of Black Gold invited every empire to participate 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.990
 of the party that event entered history and was marked as the last 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.340
 great part of the empire 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.250
 the royal family and other great personalities of the empire participated 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 in the neighborhood that night 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.440
 The island was crowded with about two thousand people scattered around the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 Castle 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.000
 cuba it was tribute to the chilean ship chilean chi chi arrived 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.660
 here on the 9th of January to visit 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.530
 the truth ana told the petebista not 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.060
 the action worth was an aponia ours 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440
 to cabinet 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 which was planned should opt for the power at the moment 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.130
 with all the problems that were on sale at the end of the monarchy that solved 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.120
 show that he can not 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.050
 and so did a bar it with a wizard a little exaggerated in relation 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.230
 at the normal age of the monarchy the castle was inaugurated in 1889 led 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 seven years until the registered Portuguese that eliminated the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.460
 construction 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.939
 at first known as rat island 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.090
 the place was chosen to serve as a customs checkpoint 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.940
 hence the name fiscal fiscal creates a fiscal position 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.750
 this was indicated in guanabara Bay 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.330
 after it was built in the river there was a project a first project 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
 very simple that was raised that the emperor saw 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.440
 and when he saw that he thought it was not enough for what it is. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 an important position in the middle of guanabara bay 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:19.900
 and they say he said mafra z more or less so be it and that island was 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.899
 like a case ready to receive a beautiful jewel 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.669
 well this was the signal for the architect of alverca 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.989
 to fischer if the project really of a monument 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.609
 at that time he did in neo-Gothic style 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.729
 the last analysis that is an exit that we are 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.619
 accustomed for a long time 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.719
 the expenses with the preparation was very strong the ps got all the wealth 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.809
 prepared for the thousands of guests food 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.620
 I was hired as an important confectioner than the one of January at the time 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:54.919
 that gave a defect 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.729
 and the steak and there were taken to me in the back of the island where people 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.709
 take turns 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.389
 they were not all at the same time 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.919
 with poetry 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:11.809
 with an extremely varied menu when it is a party of this 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:12.489
 type 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.430
 they limit the number of silver in the party of great and practice these great 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.769
 wine 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.430
 it really was a party unlike whoever drank the side of 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.699
 outside the island the royal family has a specially prepared banquet 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.339
 previous castle 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.089
 this was where the royal family dines during the great father 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.959
 was so much food and drink plenty of it the candidate came to have 12 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.679
 the society of Rio de Janeiro only spoke in the 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:46.579
 until today the event is known by striking curiosities the biggest problem 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.589
 was from brother to island had no beach toilets with a population of 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:51.809
 Sergipe 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.639
 pm 2 thousand people 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.639
 1 provenzano preceded the prayer began 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.360
 with paul di remains films of other things 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.829
 and the names also improvised a bath 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.099
 the bari that would improve the image of the emperor generate many results 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.049
 positive six days after the great party was proclaimed the republic of Brazil 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.590
 the complete document of the public tender 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.949
 the others were from the country 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.249
 it's an attraction 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.809
 is what people see in the middle of the guanabara bay that is possible 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:25.889
 visit 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.280
 and that has a remarkable architecture where stands out the works of masonry 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.919
 their work in stone 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.150
 in fact with the stone 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.570
 the same stone of the next one goes of sugar of those mountains of the entrance 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.289
 of rio de janeiro bar 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.770
 are too much 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.770
 and also very beautiful vital 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.099
 the floor of the main lion bear tower teach that I share 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.990
 Brazilian forest woods 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.319
 all worked 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.710
 I think these are the stock car recharge points 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.509
 on the way home we say goodbye to the island 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.780
 it is impossible not to go back to the 19th century and dream of the one that was the greatest 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.629
 Brazilian monarchy party
