one to the sound crap and they get a
little<00:04:39.919> tuning<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.160> notch<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.729> pic<00:04:42.380> strap<00:04:43.380> clip

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
little tuning a notch in pic strap clip

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.370 
little tuning a notch in pic strap clip
so<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:44.790> strap<00:04:45.210> doesn't<00:04:45.630> keep<00:04:45.780> falling<00:04:46.290> off

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380

you should get this into a more secure
place<00:04:51.080> yeah<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.110> guess<00:04:52.290> front<00:04:52.979> strap<00:04:53.460> pegs<00:04:55.669> yeah
