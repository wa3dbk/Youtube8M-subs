00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.129
 good day in front of me lies a watermelon it 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.830
 such a tasty berry 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.330
 and today I want to show you how and 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.029
 conventional kitchen knives 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.270
 watermelon turn a very beautiful bouquet 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.399
 flowers for this you need one bigger knife 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.340
 and another knife is smaller 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:43.170
 so we proceed with a large knife cut off 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:46.210
 peel and knife burn blood in a glass 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.110
 cut down about half the floor 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.700
 centimeter further knife at an angle of 45 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:01:01.720
 degrees I cut this circle so that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:04.269
 he was visible to us well 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.049
 rounded edges i will cut sharp here 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:14.350
 corners I'll come back and cut out a semicircle here 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.370
 such a line do further at an angle of 45 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 degrees i cut the flesh under it 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.820
 leaflet 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.790
 the first petal and done further do 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.909
 take the second petal knife and start 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.870
 a little bit and that's the territory of the first 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.960
 petals and even semicircle all cut out 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.200
 at an angle of 45 degrees crawl through the flesh 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 watermelon 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:54.040
 cut a semicircle with a knife and cut it out again 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:57.189
 the flesh under the petal we remove well 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.670
 the middle of our flower is ready lady 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:08.429
 hurt cut the petals i take the knife and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:12.280
 I start with a knife to cut a petal 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:17.069
 first and undercut the flesh under it 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.109
 45 degree angle free petal 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:26.030
 Here is the first petal 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:33.409
 looking for a knife for the first petal and cut it 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.409
 2 and cut the flesh by petal 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.550
 trim slightly and do more 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:01.240
 one petal winding need previous 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:06.420
 petal pruned flesh and do 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.420
 probably the last petal in this row 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:19.680
 I cut the pulp here the first row is ready 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:26.670
 then I will remove a little under the petals 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:31.240
 let our down and so here I cut out and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.130
 cut off the flesh and so I will try 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.130
 do the whole row 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:39.750
 Well, the first rosette is ready and now I 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:44.970
 I will make the buds with a knife and I will 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:52.800
 these are the semicircular oval 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:05:02.000
 I will cut the notches and cut them off so that 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:02.000
 they were so visible 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:14.939
 sharp corners i cut and form a bud i 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:23.249
 I take a knife and from here 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:27.439
 I make such notches and cut the flesh then 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.439
 from the middle do the other side down 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:45.110
 and on the other hand it turns out 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:54.819
 such a bud will make such curly 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:54.819
 the cuts free the pulp from on the dirty 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:15.840
 I will make another such bud the same 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:17.939
 the way i cut and the other button here 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.169
 we got such a rose with two life 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:27.889
 Well, now I will cut the leaves 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:27.889
 etc. I take our here and do this here 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.979
 from points 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:46.830
 making a notch so here we cut out then 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:52.820
 you will see the leaf and cut out the flesh under 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:56.610
 a little bit of everything and I will do such 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.840
 crossbars from physics to be seen 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.840
 that we have this leaf 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.870
 and I cut another sheet a little bit trimmed 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.310
 and 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.310
 from here you want if 

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:33.909
 such a principle i will cut and others 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.909
