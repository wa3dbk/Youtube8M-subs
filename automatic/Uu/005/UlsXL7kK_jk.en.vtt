00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.980
 it's great it's my dream what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.570
 the 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.460
 this choice we will discover many things 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.760

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.500
 not review see in xl never was 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.989

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:02.089
 canvas comes out it's gone 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.949
 to say is that I will not go there 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.970
 in my no that's why I read 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.500
 know them when I was younger 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.560
 and I'm pretty attached to their 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 characters 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 his mother 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 that for children it's really very 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.549
 well thought very funny very cool 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.180

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.340
 many times been laughing 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.700
 Demorand the humor I really have a lot 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.049
 love 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 at the level of jokes at the level of 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.030
 Munich and still two characters that 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.890
 allows marvel to introduce new 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 characters as yet animated 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.400

 the nice gamma ogc this 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.840
 I made communities in 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.900
 preview of the bonuses I would have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.540
 of avengers so sympathetic with a 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.500
 little documentary this is it the 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.120
 documentary on special effects 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.680
 were really good we can not manage to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.300
 differentiate otherwise than seeing them 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.540
 like really knowing how the movie has 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.750
 been designed 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.670
 visual effects 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.620
 the graphics part all that can be 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 to do 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.069
 really loved discovering the film under a 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.220
 other angle actually I was asked to 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.510
 sit down the room to breathe better 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 cell because a few people to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.599
 my dealer seen I pose right away 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.599
 guess 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.880
 good to see something else that does not have 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.860
 has been released and has made the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.210
 room but how hysterical and with 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.070
 him the icing on the cake what is it 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.940
 these first images iron man 3 iron man 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:06.220
 3 3 and ron wood king tony stark gets dressed 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.060
 like that because at the height of kevin 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.580
 mass per person 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.599
 it always returns in the trend of 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.599
 couple an iron man 3 he is not bad thank you
