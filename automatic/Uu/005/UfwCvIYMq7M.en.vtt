00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
back lights back but now you can

all<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.770> those<00:01:42.040> features<00:01:43.200> let's<00:01:44.200> go<00:01:44.290> ahead<00:01:44.440> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
all of those features let's go ahead and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.140 
all of those features let's go ahead and
go<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.650> settings<00:01:45.190> real<00:01:45.550> quick<00:01:45.850> so<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.090> can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
go to settings real quick so you can

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
five android for da 12 but again

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.359 
five android for da 12 but again
hardware<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.380> clock<00:02:08.590> down<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.130> sort<00:02:09.280> of

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
hardware the clock down but we sort of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.210 
hardware the clock down but we sort of
we<00:02:09.489> know<00:02:09.640> most<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.119> stuff<00:02:11.100> there's<00:02:12.100> no

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
we know most of that stuff there's no

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.979 
we know most of that stuff there's no
they<00:02:12.340> look<00:02:12.550> at<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> menu<00:02:13.000> beats<00:02:13.540> audio<00:02:13.660> in

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
they look at the menu beats audio in

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.199 
they look at the menu beats audio in
there<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> lot<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.580> same<00:02:15.760> sort<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
there it's a lot of the same sort of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.180 
there it's a lot of the same sort of
sense<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:17.050> we're<00:02:17.260> seeing<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.620> past<00:02:17.860> just

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
sense that we're seeing in the past just

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.610 
sense that we're seeing in the past just
looks<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.519> little<00:02:18.640> bit<00:02:18.820> different<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:20.470> let's

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
looks a little bit different but let's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.780 
looks a little bit different but let's
take<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.800> look<00:02:20.950> at<00:02:20.980> some<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.280> scent<00:02:21.580> stuff

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
take a look at some of the scent stuff

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670 
take a look at some of the scent stuff
so<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.330> big<00:02:22.720> difference<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> scoop

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
so the big difference here is the scoop

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
so the big difference here is the scoop
blink<00:02:24.190> feed<00:02:24.459> they're<00:02:24.730> calling<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.690> it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
blink feed they're calling it and it's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.990 
blink feed they're calling it and it's
basically<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.100> live<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.760> think

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
basically like a live you know I think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.790 
basically like a live you know I think
it<00:02:28.090> looks<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> mix<00:02:28.540> between<00:02:28.800> Windows

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
it looks like a mix between Windows

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400 
it looks like a mix between Windows
dating<00:02:30.040> live<00:02:30.160> tiles<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.760> Flipboard<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.200> it's

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
dating live tiles and Flipboard so it's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.640

we<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.189> apps<00:02:58.459> or<00:02:58.730> say<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.209> really<00:02:59.420> quick

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
we go to apps or say that really quick

we go to apps or say that really quick
after<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.049> looks<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.530> little<00:03:00.830> bit<00:03:01.010> different<00:03:01.250> to

with<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:10.120> grid<00:03:11.120> size<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.019> default<00:03:12.409> size

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
with the grid size like the default size

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.770 
with the grid size like the default size
actually<00:03:13.370> 3<00:03:13.760> by<00:03:13.909> 4<00:03:13.970> which<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.540> sort<00:03:14.720> of

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
actually 3 by 4 which is sort of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.869 
actually 3 by 4 which is sort of
atrocious<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:16.190> go<00:03:16.370> back<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.670> home<00:03:16.849> screen

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
so do not just walk through this one

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.860 
so do not just walk through this one
screen<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.519> actually<00:03:19.790> swipe<00:03:20.060> over<00:03:20.269> here<00:03:20.599> get

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.050 
to zoom sort of give that old sense look
where<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.069> can<00:03:25.190> add<00:03:25.370> home<00:03:25.609> screens<00:03:25.909> and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
where you can add home screens and

where you can add home screens and
things<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.359> so<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.890> kind<00:03:28.129> of<00:03:28.189> a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
things like that so it's kind of a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
things like that so it's kind of a
different<00:03:28.609> experience<00:03:28.939> though<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.450> still<00:03:29.629> has

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
different experience though it still has

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.210 
different experience though it still has
some<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.230> same<00:03:30.440> stuff<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.920> we've<00:03:31.040> seen

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
from since in the past it's definitely

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.860 
from since in the past it's definitely
definitely<00:03:34.609> a<00:03:34.819> new<00:03:34.940> take<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.389> smartphone

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870
