00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.500 
we thought that given the small space
someone<00:04:07.950> needed<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.400> privacy<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.180> dress

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
someone needed to have privacy to dress

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.250 
someone needed to have privacy to dress
if<00:04:10.080> there<00:04:10.410> was<00:04:10.650> two<00:04:11.100> people<00:04:11.520> in<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.450> space<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
if there was two people in the space and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.170 
if there was two people in the space and
you<00:04:13.440> can<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.740> how<00:04:13.860> much<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.220> stops<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.910> wise

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.220 

yeah

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.890 

we<00:04:21.130> built<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.580> prototype<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.420> probably<00:04:22.690> cost

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
we built this prototype it probably cost

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.080 
we built this prototype it probably cost
us<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> couple<00:04:23.380> hundred<00:04:23.410> grand<00:04:23.830> but<00:04:24.130> we<00:04:24.730> needed

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
us a couple hundred grand but we needed

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.120 
us a couple hundred grand but we needed
really<00:04:25.210> needed<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.660> know<00:04:25.870> exactly<00:04:26.710> how<00:04:26.830> much

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
really needed to know exactly how much

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.650 
really needed to know exactly how much
is<00:04:27.310> enough<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.150> we've<00:04:28.300> learned<00:04:28.390> quite<00:04:28.510> a

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
is enough and so we've learned quite a

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.000 
is enough and so we've learned quite a
bit<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:28.930> if<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:29.170> learn<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:29.530> example<00:04:29.560> that

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
bit and if we learn for example that

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.230 
bit and if we learn for example that
ceiling<00:04:30.310> heights<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.730> be<00:04:30.820> at<00:04:30.880> least<00:04:30.940> nine

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
ceiling heights have to be at least nine

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.330 
ceiling heights have to be at least nine
feet<00:04:31.540> width<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.260> room<00:04:32.530> has<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.920> be<00:04:32.980> at<00:04:33.130> least

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
feet width the room has to be at least

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.390 
feet width the room has to be at least
ten<00:04:33.760> feet<00:04:34.000> eleven<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.050> much<00:04:35.230> better<00:04:35.890> for<00:04:36.100> a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
ten feet eleven is much better for a

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.830 
ten feet eleven is much better for a
variety<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.820> reasons<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.510> our<00:04:37.600> next

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
variety of reasons so our next

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.720 
variety of reasons so our next
generation<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.560> be<00:04:38.650> 11<00:04:38.920> feet<00:04:39.250> we

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
generation is going to be 11 feet we

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.970 
generation is going to be 11 feet we
need<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.060> know<00:04:40.300> how<00:04:40.720> big<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.050> bathroom<00:04:41.470> was<00:04:41.680> so

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
need to know how big the bathroom was so

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.610 
need to know how big the bathroom was so
you<00:04:42.160> two<00:04:42.670> people<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.270> turn<00:04:43.750> around<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.260> that

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
you two people can turn around and that

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.440 
you two people can turn around and that
sort<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.890> thing<00:04:45.160> how<00:04:45.670> much<00:04:45.820> counter<00:04:46.150> space<00:04:46.420> you

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
sort of thing how much counter space you

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.570 
sort of thing how much counter space you
need<00:04:46.840> we<00:04:47.500> also<00:04:47.820> have<00:04:49.500> cooktop<00:04:50.500> here<00:04:50.830> under<00:04:51.460> the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
need we also have cooktop here under the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.860 
need we also have cooktop here under the
counter<00:04:51.940> we<00:04:52.060> didn't<00:04:52.210> want<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.390> clutter<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
counter we didn't want to clutter up the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.150 
counter we didn't want to clutter up the
counter<00:04:53.200> top<00:04:53.380> too<00:04:53.530> much<00:04:53.680> this<00:04:53.920> is<00:04:54.070> an

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
counter top too much this is an

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.950 
counter top too much this is an
induction<00:04:54.490> heater<00:04:55.180> which<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> very<00:04:55.780> cool

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
induction heater which is a very cool

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.140 
induction heater which is a very cool
idea<00:04:56.200> because<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.710> never<00:04:56.860> gets<00:04:56.980> hot<00:04:57.190> but<00:04:57.580> we

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
idea because it never gets hot but we

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.820 
idea because it never gets hot but we
concluded<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.750> this<00:04:58.960> was<00:04:59.200> too<00:04:59.440> clever<00:04:59.680> by

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
concluded that this was too clever by

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.680 
concluded that this was too clever by
1/2<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.580> it's<00:05:00.820> going<00:05:01.090> back<00:05:01.390> on<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
1/2 and it's going back on the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.420 
1/2 and it's going back on the
countertop<00:05:02.170> this<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:02.920> another<00:05:03.130> cool<00:05:03.400> idea

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
countertop this is another cool idea

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.720 
countertop this is another cool idea
that<00:05:03.850> didn't<00:05:04.000> make<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.240> cut<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.980> round<00:05:05.980> sink

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
that didn't make the cut a round sink

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.450 
that didn't make the cut a round sink
it's<00:05:07.180> too<00:05:07.390> small<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.900> fit<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.260> real<00:05:08.560> big<00:05:09.040> pasta

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
it's too small to fit a real big pasta

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.310 
it's too small to fit a real big pasta
pan<00:05:09.820> it's<00:05:10.240> actually<00:05:10.660> much<00:05:10.840> better<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.170> have<00:05:11.200> a

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
pan it's actually much better to have a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.980 
pan it's actually much better to have a
much<00:05:11.500> larger<00:05:12.000> sink<00:05:13.000> where<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.300> can<00:05:13.480> put<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> lot

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
much larger sink where you can put a lot

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.480 
much larger sink where you can put a lot
of<00:05:14.140> dishes<00:05:14.290> instead<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.860> having<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> smaller

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
of dishes instead of having a smaller

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.460 
of dishes instead of having a smaller
cool<00:05:15.820> looking<00:05:16.150> one<00:05:16.180> we<00:05:16.540> learned<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:17.260> it's

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
cool looking one we learned that it's

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.820 
cool looking one we learned that it's
very<00:05:17.830> handy<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.550> small<00:05:18.790> space<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.960> have<00:05:20.170> air

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
very handy in a small space to have air

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.130 
very handy in a small space to have air
movement<00:05:21.490> even<00:05:21.670> if<00:05:21.940> it's<00:05:22.060> not<00:05:22.180> absolutely

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
movement even if it's not absolutely

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.010 
movement even if it's not absolutely
necessary<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.890> cool<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.280> place<00:05:24.870> it's<00:05:25.870> also

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
necessary to cool the place it's also

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.520 
necessary to cool the place it's also
nice<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.680> put<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:28.000> many<00:05:28.420> of<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.110> amenities

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
nice to put in as many of the amenities

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.310 
nice to put in as many of the amenities
as<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.310> can<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.450> that's<00:05:31.810> why<00:05:31.990> we<00:05:32.170> have

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
as you can and so that's why we have

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.780 
as you can and so that's why we have
built-in<00:05:32.800> tables

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
built-in tables

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.750 
built-in tables
built-in<00:05:34.600> banquettes<00:05:35.620> we<00:05:36.220> have<00:05:36.340> built-in

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
built-in banquettes we have built-in

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.360 
built-in banquettes we have built-in
lights<00:05:37.440> come<00:05:38.440> on<00:05:38.500> that's<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:38.980> a<00:05:39.040> light<00:05:39.220> right

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
lights come on that's not a light right

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.150 
lights come on that's not a light right
there<00:05:39.400> that's<00:05:40.120> actually<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.630> solar<00:05:41.200> tube<00:05:41.350> we

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
there that's actually a solar tube we

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.350 
there that's actually a solar tube we
wanted<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.520> see<00:05:42.700> if<00:05:42.790> it<00:05:42.820> was<00:05:42.940> worthwhile<00:05:43.150> to

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
wanted to see if it was worthwhile to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.710 
wanted to see if it was worthwhile to
put<00:05:43.690> light<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.260> get<00:05:44.410> into<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.770> bathroom<00:05:45.160> and

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
put light to get into the bathroom and

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720 
put light to get into the bathroom and
we<00:05:46.720> concluded<00:05:47.230> it<00:05:47.350> was<00:05:47.440> not<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:48.400> did<00:05:48.550> provide

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
we concluded it was not it did provide

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.960 
we concluded it was not it did provide
enough<00:05:49.210> light<00:05:50.170> for<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.950> headache<00:05:51.490> of<00:05:51.520> doing

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
enough light for the headache of doing

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.280 
enough light for the headache of doing
it<00:05:52.090> this<00:05:52.390> is<00:05:52.510> a<00:05:52.570> good<00:05:52.690> example<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:53.110> why<00:05:53.230> you

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
it this is a good example of why you

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.870 
it this is a good example of why you
