let's<00:01:32.450> sweet<00:01:32.810> let<00:01:33.020> me<00:01:33.079> show<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.289> how<00:01:33.439> we

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
let's sweet let me show you how we

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.539 
let's sweet let me show you how we
scrape<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.249> and<00:01:34.509> diagnose<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.189> so<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:37.219> take<00:01:37.520> a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
scrape it and diagnose it so I take a

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.459 
scrape it and diagnose it so I take a
slide<00:01:37.909> with<00:01:38.329> a<00:01:38.359> little<00:01:38.600> drop<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.810> oil<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.319> it

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
slide with a little drop of oil on it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.749 
slide with a little drop of oil on it
and<00:01:39.939> then<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:40.969> take<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> blade<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.549> put

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
and then I take a blade and then I put

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.240 
and then I take a blade and then I put
the<00:01:43.850> blade<00:01:44.060> into<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.420> oil<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:45.709> get<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:45.920> edge

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the blade into the oil to get the edge

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.240 
the blade into the oil to get the edge
coated<00:01:46.850> wit<00:01:47.090> with<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.079> oil<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:48.619> when<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:48.829> scrape

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
coated wit with the oil so when I scrape

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.510 
coated wit with the oil so when I scrape
the<00:01:49.490> skin<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.689> skin<00:01:50.929> is<00:01:51.469> on<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:51.859> edge<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.459> the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the skin the skin is on the edge of the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.889 
the skin the skin is on the edge of the
blade<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.209> look<00:01:53.329> at<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.509> under<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
blade and I can look at it under the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:54.849 
blade and I can look at it under the
microscope

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
microscope

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.309 
microscope
so<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:55.609> will<00:01:56.030> scrape<00:01:56.990> down<00:01:57.709> on<00:01:58.099> the<00:01:58.250> skin<00:01:58.640> like

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
so I will scrape down on the skin like

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.169 
so I will scrape down on the skin like
that<00:02:00.879> are<00:02:01.879> you<00:02:02.000> focusing<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.959> know<00:02:04.179> scrape

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
the automat on the skin it'll get a

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.440 
the automat on the skin it'll get a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
bunch of skin on the blade and demodex

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.660 
bunch of skin on the blade and demodex
you<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.440> scrape<00:02:12.709> till<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.099> get<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> little

you have to scrape till you get a little

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.360 
you have to scrape till you get a little
bit<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> blood<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.920> scrape<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
bit of blood so I'm going to scrape a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.940 
bit of blood so I'm going to scrape a
little<00:02:16.519> bit<00:02:16.700> more<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:18.200> I'll<00:02:18.349> take<00:02:18.620> this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
little bit more and then I'll take this

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.900

I'll put it into the side and then we'll

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.860 
I'll put it into the side and then we'll
look<00:02:25.190> at<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.459> under<00:02:25.609> the<00:02:25.760> microscope<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.720> let's

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
look at it under the microscope so let's

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.339 
look at it under the microscope so let's
go<00:02:27.019> look<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.739> got<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:29.109> or<00:02:30.109> did<00:02:30.260> you

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
go look it's here we got it or did you

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.990 
go look it's here we got it or did you
see<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> mage<00:02:30.829> mites<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.340> have<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.700> put<00:02:31.879> them

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
see the mage mites you have to put them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000 
see the mage mites you have to put them
on<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.269> side<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.810> put<00:02:33.139> the<00:02:33.200> slide<00:02:33.470> under<00:02:33.920> the

on the side and put the slide under the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.879 
on the side and put the slide under the
microscope<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.700> where<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:34.880> scraped<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:36.319> skin<00:02:36.620> I

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
microscope so where I scraped the skin I

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.640 
microscope so where I scraped the skin I
put<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.730> slide<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.329> put<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> drop<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.049> oil<00:02:39.349> on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
put on the slide I put a drop of oil on

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
going to put into the microscope let's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.080 
going to put into the microscope let's
see<00:02:43.940> what<00:02:44.090> we<00:02:44.209> see<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:46.099> my<00:02:46.340> computer<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.060> bought

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
see what we see so my computer I bought

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.030 
see what we see so my computer I bought
a<00:02:47.299> little<00:02:47.480> all<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.870> microscope<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> camera

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
a little all on microscope with a camera

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250 
a little all on microscope with a camera
on<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:50.120> sends<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> picture<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.109> my

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
on it and it sends the picture to my

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.539 
on it and it sends the picture to my
computer<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:51.859> let's<00:02:51.889> look<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> computer

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
computer so let's look on the computer

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.199 
computer so let's look on the computer
and<00:02:52.910> I'll<00:02:53.030> show<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.480> what<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:54.049> see<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:56.030> all
