00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 the staff imputing here the subject of the 31 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.679
 gari on the chassis and here was the bar 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.690
 this blazer here in 6s already had the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.719
 problem has been welded so much that it 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.210
 they even painted the weld by a well 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 thick here to solve the problem 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 mere point on this side was not so 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.439
 criticism, nor was it to prevent the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.529
 problem only expanded 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 was that bar now the bar is no longer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 100% home because you already moved here a little 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 to support his mother how to make a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.329
 here try to fit support to the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 prevent the problem from returning here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:52.620
 solder click again and personal 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.070
 we fit a side to shoot first 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 is makes it different as well as outside 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.710
 and make a forcinha here to for all 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.140
 to hit town will have to give a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.700
 opens a little more sound shakes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 problem of adjustment but the problem in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.570
 line heart problem what is bar and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.200
 did not fit the two sides was still 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 already made with a holder already open 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 to solve the problem but a little 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.909
 out that 2010 is the original car but 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.580
 we checked the tire and it is not wasting 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.579
 normally the alignment is still 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.500
 corrected this difference 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.280
 the staff is a job here but 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 we were able to align some screws 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.530
 cross here perfectly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.189
 supports are in place despite the weld 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 there that only prevent is worth that with said 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.190
 that align the bracket 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.280
 no big job here but like the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.720
 screw itself was able to pull the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.260
 support in place 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 Taio but an installed tent but 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.840
 senate program there
