the show it's he's about halfway to
being<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> would<00:01:14.100> consider<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
being what I would consider to be a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.330 
being what I would consider to be a
decent<00:01:15.000> sideswipe<00:01:15.720> toy<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.710> stands<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.280> he

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.670 
we're going to put the arms pointing
straight<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.390> front<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> figure<00:03:31.170> that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
straight in front of the figure that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.650 
straight in front of the figure that
will<00:03:31.920> then<00:03:32.190> give<00:03:32.550> us<00:03:32.670> enough<00:03:32.910> clearance<00:03:33.330> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
will then give us enough clearance to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.760 
will then give us enough clearance to
turn<00:03:34.230> these<00:03:35.100> red<00:03:35.820> sections<00:03:36.420> around<00:03:36.650> over<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
turn these red sections around over the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.090 
turn these red sections around over the
wheels<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.790> form<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.720> wheel<00:03:39.960> wells<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.980> we'll

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
wheels to form the wheel wells so we'll

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.040 
wheels to form the wheel wells so we'll
do<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.640> both<00:03:41.910> sides<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.690> figures

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
do that for both sides of the figures

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.320 
do that for both sides of the figures
and<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.680> way<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.030> have

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
and the way you want to do it is to have

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.690 
and the way you want to do it is to have
the<00:03:45.540> point<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.230> next<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.710> head<00:03:46.890> fold

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the point that's next to the head fold

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.510 
the point that's next to the head fold
out<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.000> away<00:03:48.780> from<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.290> body<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:50.070> really

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
out and away from the body that really

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.670 
out and away from the body that really
is<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.700> best<00:03:51.000> way<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:51.240> do<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.780> once<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.530> do

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
is the best way to do it once you do

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.920 
is the best way to do it once you do
that<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.490> can<00:03:53.670> put<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.210> arms<00:03:54.240> back<00:03:55.070> along<00:03:56.070> the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
that you can put the arms back along the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.710 
that you can put the arms back along the
parallel<00:03:57.930> or<00:03:58.350> parallel<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.490> body<00:03:59.820> take

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
parallel or parallel of the body take

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.080 
parallel or parallel of the body take
the<00:04:00.810> backpack<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.470> fold<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.010> up<00:04:02.400> over<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the backpack and fold that up over the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
the backpack and fold that up over the
robot<00:04:03.450> head<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.430> then<00:04:05.430> fold<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.210> arms<00:04:06.720> up<00:04:07.170> so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
robot head and then fold the arms up so

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.000 
robot head and then fold the arms up so
they<00:04:08.310> snap<00:04:08.610> into<00:04:08.880> place<00:04:09.320> next<00:04:10.320> for<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.800> legs

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
they snap into place next for the legs

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.980 
they snap into place next for the legs
what<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.090> fold<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.540> feet<00:04:12.750> down

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
what I like to do is fold the feet down

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.970 
what I like to do is fold the feet down
just<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.310> bit<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.910> then<00:04:15.810> rotate<00:04:16.710> the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
just a little bit and then rotate the

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.580 
just a little bit and then rotate the
entirety<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.299> lay<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.900> outside<00:04:19.290> leg

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
entirety of the lay of the outside leg

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.960 
entirety of the lay of the outside leg
along<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.070> wheel<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.880> foot

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
along the wheel and the foot

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.610 
along the wheel and the foot
around<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.300> back<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.720> figure<00:04:22.960> around<00:04:23.350> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
around the back of the figure around the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.960 
around the back of the figure around the
back<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:23.980> leg<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:26.410> will<00:04:26.890> fold<00:04:27.580> down

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
back of the leg and that will fold down

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.940 
back of the leg and that will fold down
and<00:04:28.870> into<00:04:29.470> place<00:04:30.270> like<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.680> bottom

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and into place like that so the bottom

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.230 
and into place like that so the bottom
of<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.100> foot<00:04:33.280> then<00:04:33.430> becomes<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.030> rear

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
of the foot then becomes the rear

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.800 
of the foot then becomes the rear
windscreen<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.980> engine<00:04:36.580> cover<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
windscreen and the engine cover of the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.380 
windscreen and the engine cover of the
alt<00:04:38.020> mode<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.460> kind<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.760> flip<00:04:40.150> that

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
alt mode so just kind of flip that

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.130 
alt mode so just kind of flip that
around<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.970> then<00:04:42.970> once<00:04:43.420> we<00:04:43.600> get<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.990> this

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
around and then once we get it to this

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.290 
around and then once we get it to this
point<00:04:44.470> we<00:04:44.680> can<00:04:44.860> combine<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.280> legs<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.910> then

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
point we can combine the legs and then

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.240 
point we can combine the legs and then
we<00:04:46.420> have<00:04:46.600> a<00:04:46.630> lot<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.930> panel<00:04:47.350> gaps<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.830> deal<00:04:47.980> with

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
we have a lot of panel gaps to deal with

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.850 
we have a lot of panel gaps to deal with
and<00:04:48.490> that's<00:04:49.480> actually<00:04:49.750> probably<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.470> hardest

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
and that's actually probably the hardest

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.410 
and that's actually probably the hardest
part<00:04:50.890> of<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.160> transformation<00:04:51.420> sideswipe

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
part of the transformation sideswipe

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.810 
part of the transformation sideswipe
doll<00:04:52.630> vote<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:53.050> really<00:04:53.590> really<00:04:54.160> cool<00:04:54.520> I

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
doll vote is really really cool I

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.700 
doll vote is really really cool I
actually<00:04:55.090> like<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.810> quite<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.200> bit

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
actually like it quite a bit

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.040 
actually like it quite a bit
there<00:04:57.160> are<00:04:57.490> some<00:04:57.790> issues<00:04:57.940> with<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.360> paint<00:04:58.690> but

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
there are some issues with the paint but

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.480 
there are some issues with the paint but
we'll<00:04:59.230> talk<00:04:59.440> about<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.830> in<00:04:59.890> a<00:05:00.010> moment

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
we'll talk about that in a moment

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.640 
we'll talk about that in a moment
I<00:05:00.520> like<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.330> design<00:05:01.630> back<00:05:01.930> here<00:05:02.320> with<00:05:02.500> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
I like the design back here with the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.620 
I like the design back here with the
kanji<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.460> don't<00:05:03.670> know<00:05:03.820> if<00:05:03.970> this<00:05:04.120> actually

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
kanji I don't know if this actually

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.990 
kanji I don't know if this actually
means<00:05:04.990> anything<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.130> Autobot<00:05:06.490> symbol<00:05:06.850> up

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
means anything and the Autobot symbol up

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.900 
means anything and the Autobot symbol up
in<00:05:07.180> front<00:05:07.420> is<00:05:07.600> nice<00:05:07.960> however<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.770> don't<00:05:09.550> know

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
in front is nice however I don't know

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.510 
in front is nice however I don't know
why<00:05:10.300> but<00:05:10.690> every<00:05:11.290> single<00:05:11.560> deluxe<00:05:12.010> figure<00:05:12.490> I

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
why but every single deluxe figure I

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.720 
why but every single deluxe figure I
have<00:05:13.090> has<00:05:13.810> their<00:05:14.260> Autobot<00:05:14.800> symbol<00:05:15.250> kind<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.580> at

a tilt off to the left it's very very
strange<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.600> don't<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.870> why<00:05:20.200> all<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.830> my

strange I don't know why all of my

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.340 
strange I don't know why all of my
figures<00:05:21.370> have<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:21.940> there<00:05:22.780> are<00:05:22.930> two<00:05:23.140> major

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
figures have that there are two major

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.080 
figures have that there are two major
