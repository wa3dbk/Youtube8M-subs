paying attention Bolivar I didn't
discover<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.090> my<00:02:34.330> estimation<00:02:35.020> laws

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
discover that my estimation laws

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.220 
discover that my estimation laws
internet<00:02:35.800> okay<00:02:36.610> then<00:02:37.060> what<00:02:37.660> was<00:02:37.840> my<00:02:37.989> actual

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
internet okay then what was my actual

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.699 
internet okay then what was my actual
survival<00:02:38.890> rate<00:02:39.330> well<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> let<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.930> upside<00:02:41.380> down

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
survival rate well I let you upside down

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.930 
survival rate well I let you upside down
so<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.280> means<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.440> means<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.770> was<00:02:45.040> still<00:02:45.580> 3

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
so that means that means it was still 3

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.449 
so that means that means it was still 3
