to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.490> Serena<00:02:02.880> serve<00:02:03.240> basically<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.079> going

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to be Serena serve basically it's going

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.480 
to be Serena serve basically it's going
to<00:02:04.259> make<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> difference<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:05.040> way<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to make the difference one way the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.819
