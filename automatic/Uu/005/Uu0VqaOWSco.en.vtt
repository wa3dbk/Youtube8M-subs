00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
specific video I'm going to be reviewing

specific video I'm going to be reviewing
for<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.830> ones<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.190> really<00:00:32.490> really<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for the ones that I really really like

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
for the ones that I really really like
and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.840> another<00:00:33.900> video<00:00:34.350> soon<00:00:34.620> off

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and I will have another video soon off

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.470 
and I will have another video soon off
another<00:00:35.280> case<00:00:35.580> that<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:35.850> did<00:00:36.030> send<00:00:36.239> me<00:00:36.360> which

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
another case that they did send me which

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
another case that they did send me which
I<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.989> quite<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.130> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I also do quite like but I think that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.380 
I also do quite like but I think that
that<00:00:38.400> would<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.640> deserves<00:00:39.090> its<00:00:39.300> own

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that would actually deserves its own

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
that would actually deserves its own
separate<00:00:39.750> video<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.100> starting<00:00:41.430> off

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
separate video so actually starting off

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280 
separate video so actually starting off
we<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.420> very<00:00:42.540> minimal<00:00:42.750> case<00:00:43.110> now

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
we have a very very minimal case now

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
we have a very very minimal case now
this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> called<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> mini<00:00:44.070> sued<00:00:44.340> ultra<00:00:44.730> thin

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this is called a mini sued ultra thin

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.210 
this is called a mini sued ultra thin
air<00:00:45.120> case<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> iphone<00:00:46.379> 5c<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
air case for the iphone 5c and this of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.710 
air case for the iphone 5c and this of
course<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:47.700> crystal<00:00:48.030> clear<00:00:48.270> version<00:00:48.480> as

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
course is the crystal clear version as

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.010 
course is the crystal clear version as
you<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.650> you<00:00:49.710> guys<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> probably<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.840> now<00:00:51.840> one

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you as you guys can probably see now one

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.210 
you as you guys can probably see now one
of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> reasons<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.950> do<00:00:53.070> like

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
of the reasons I really really do like

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.860 
of the reasons I really really do like
this<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> does<00:00:54.629> let<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this case is because it does let the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 
this case is because it does let the
entire<00:00:55.140> color<00:00:55.470> of<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.769> iphone<00:00:56.070> 5c<00:00:56.550> shine

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
entire color of your iphone 5c shine

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
entire color of your iphone 5c shine
right<00:00:57.600> through<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> reason<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.400> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
right through so the reason that you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
right through so the reason that you
probably<00:00:59.699> purchase<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.269> iphone<00:01:00.390> 5c<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
probably purchase an iphone 5c is

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
probably purchase an iphone 5c is
probably<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.769> color<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
probably just for the color because of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
probably just for the color because of
course<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> essentially<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.870> iphone<00:01:04.170> 5<00:01:04.470> now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
course it is essentially an iphone 5 now

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.350 
course it is essentially an iphone 5 now
this<00:01:05.129> case<00:01:05.370> provides<00:01:05.760> minimal<00:01:06.000> protection

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this case provides minimal protection

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
this case provides minimal protection
but<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> same<00:01:07.260> time<00:01:07.409> will<00:01:07.620> still<00:01:07.830> protect

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
but at the same time will still protect

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
but at the same time will still protect
you<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.460> scratches<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.120> scuffs<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> things

favorite case just because of the the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.110 
favorite case just because of the the

dual hard plastic polycarbonate the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.240 
dual hard plastic polycarbonate the
see-through<00:01:36.450> parts<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.890> TPU

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
see-through parts as well as the TPU

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.860 
see-through parts as well as the TPU
material<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:39.000> thought<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.510> a<00:01:39.570> really

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
material I thought this was a really

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.840 
material I thought this was a really
really<00:01:40.050> nice<00:01:40.230> combination<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.640> case

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
really nice combination but this case

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
really nice combination but this case
has<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.330> major<00:01:42.600> flaw<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.410> something

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
has one major flaw in this is something

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.110 
has one major flaw in this is something
that<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.830> lot<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.040> many<00:01:44.250> suitcases<00:01:44.490> actually

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
that a lot of many suitcases actually

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.060 
that a lot of many suitcases actually
have<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.560> power<00:01:46.770> button

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
have and that is that the power button

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
have and that is that the power button
is<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.610> super<00:01:48.150> super<00:01:48.300> tight<00:01:48.630> there's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
is just super super tight there's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.320 
is just super super tight there's
basically<00:01:49.140> no<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> adjust<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.090> when

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
basically no way to adjust this and when

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.240 
basically no way to adjust this and when
you<00:01:51.390> put<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.600> iphone<00:01:51.960> 5c<00:01:52.410> into<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.830> case<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you put your iphone 5c into the case it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.860 
you put your iphone 5c into the case it
will<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.520> end<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:54.030> holding<00:01:54.480> down<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
will actually end up holding down the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.120 
will actually end up holding down the
power<00:01:54.900> button<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.530> point<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> keeps

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
power button to the point where it keeps

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.250 
power button to the point where it keeps
requesting<00:01:56.370> you<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.730> turn<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.120> phone<00:01:57.300> off<00:01:57.480> now

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
requesting you to turn the phone off now

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.630 
requesting you to turn the phone off now
I<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.620> is<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> problem

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I know that this is not just a problem

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.280 
I know that this is not just a problem
with<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> Kinect<00:02:00.180> case<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.720> also<00:02:00.960> did

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
actually had to cut the power button

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.110 
actually had to cut the power button
connector<00:02:09.989> off<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.709> well<00:02:10.920> now<00:02:11.790> even

off the plastic power button here as you
guys<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.319> academy<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> press<00:02:17.430> down

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
guys can see academy of the press down

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.130 
guys can see academy of the press down
on<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.879> anymore<00:02:18.300> some<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> remaining

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
on it anymore some of the remaining

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.960 
on it anymore some of the remaining
rubber<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.800> still<00:02:20.159> pressing<00:02:20.459> down<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
rubber is still pressing down on the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
rubber is still pressing down on the
power<00:02:21.120> button<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.440> major

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
power button and this is the one major

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.259 
power button and this is the one major
feature<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.370> believe<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:23.819> renders

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
feature which I believe actually renders

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.089 
feature which I believe actually renders
this<00:02:24.420> case<00:02:24.629> entirely<00:02:24.989> useless<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.069> I

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
this case entirely useless and so I

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.710 
this case entirely useless and so I
can't<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.489> recommend<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.180> now<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.599> this

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
can't really recommend it now if this

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.540 
can't really recommend it now if this
doesn't<00:02:28.019> really<00:02:28.080> bother<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.430> I'm

built-in now this is one of the cases
that<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.469> was<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.829> pleasantly<00:02:47.189> surprised

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:47.999 
that I was actually pleasantly surprised

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that the last case did and i think that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.119 
that the last case did and i think that
the<00:02:51.239> design<00:02:51.569> was<00:02:51.599> phenomenal<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:52.859> as<00:02:53.040> you

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
and none of the cases that I mentioned

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.470 
and none of the cases that I mentioned

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
am glad that they do not bubble up

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.159 
am glad that they do not bubble up
screen<00:03:23.639> protectors<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.019> a

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
screen protectors because I do have a

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.629

screen protector on my phone and I has

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.280 
screen protector on my phone and I has
not<00:03:26.909> bubbled<00:03:27.269> up<00:03:27.329> using<00:03:27.629> any<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.139> cases

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
not bubbled up using any of the cases

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
not bubbled up using any of the cases
that<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.680> mentioned<00:03:28.949> in<00:03:29.219> this<00:03:29.340> video<00:03:29.519> now<00:03:30.239> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
that I mentioned in this video now the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.729 
that I mentioned in this video now the
buttons<00:03:30.599> on<00:03:30.689> this<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:30.959> very<00:03:31.139> very<00:03:31.319> tactile

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
buttons on this are very very tactile

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.229 
buttons on this are very very tactile
and<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.669> do<00:03:32.730> feel<00:03:32.969> really

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
and I think that they do feel really

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.240 
and I think that they do feel really
nice<00:03:33.389> this<00:03:34.049> case<00:03:34.260> overall<00:03:34.650> feels<00:03:34.859> really<00:03:35.069> nice

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
nice this case overall feels really nice

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.159 
nice this case overall feels really nice
in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> hand<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.909> does<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.299> has<00:03:36.449> almost<00:03:36.989> like<00:03:37.139> a

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
in the hand it does it has almost like a

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.449 
in the hand it does it has almost like a
matte<00:03:37.439> finish<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:38.010> doesn't<00:03:38.219> really<00:03:38.280> get

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
matte finish so it doesn't really get

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.219 
matte finish so it doesn't really get
grimy<00:03:38.790> or<00:03:39.090> anything<00:03:39.449> even<00:03:39.659> if<00:03:39.719> your<00:03:39.870> hands<00:03:40.139> are

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
grimy or anything even if your hands are

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.349 
grimy or anything even if your hands are
like<00:03:40.409> oil<00:03:40.620> you're<00:03:40.919> sweaty<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.849> overall<00:03:42.209> I

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
like oil you're sweaty and so overall I

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.270 
like oil you're sweaty and so overall I
really<00:03:42.389> really<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.259> this<00:03:43.500> case<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.009> the

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
the top part of this case and this is

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.849 
the top part of this case and this is
the<00:04:03.540> case<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.750> i<00:04:03.900> have<00:04:03.959> used<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.500> my<00:04:04.650> last

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
the case that i have used in my last

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.080 
the case that i have used in my last
couple<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.189> videos<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.639> i<00:04:05.699> did<00:04:05.849> get<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.030> few

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
couple of videos and i did get a few

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.550 
couple of videos and i did get a few
questions<00:04:06.599> about<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.199> I<00:04:07.229> wanted<00:04:07.500> to

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
questions about it and so I wanted to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.710 
questions about it and so I wanted to
include<00:04:07.859> it<00:04:08.069> in<00:04:08.189> this<00:04:08.280> video<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.849> thought<00:04:09.599> that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
include it in this video I thought that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.089 
include it in this video I thought that
it<00:04:09.810> would<00:04:09.870> make<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.049> separate<00:04:10.349> video<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.949> but

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
it would make a separate video on it but

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.309 
it would make a separate video on it but
it<00:04:11.189> isn't<00:04:11.430> anything<00:04:11.639> super<00:04:12.090> special<00:04:12.509> so<00:04:13.109> i<00:04:13.139> did

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
it isn't anything super special so i did

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.809 
it isn't anything super special so i did
think<00:04:13.470> i'd<00:04:13.620> make<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.829> video<00:04:14.009> and<00:04:14.370> put<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.669> in

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
think i'd make a video and put it in

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.909 
think i'd make a video and put it in
there<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.199> reasons<00:04:16.440> i<00:04:16.500> really<00:04:16.739> do

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
there now one of the reasons i really do

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.560 
there now one of the reasons i really do
like<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.250> case<00:04:17.459> as<00:04:17.639> well<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:18.030> not<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.509> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
like this case as well is not just the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.449 
like this case as well is not just the
matte<00:04:18.840> finish<00:04:19.169> which<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.949> course<00:04:19.979> actually

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
matte finish which of course actually

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.740 
matte finish which of course actually
does<00:04:20.609> feel<00:04:20.639> really<00:04:20.820> really<00:04:21.180> nice<00:04:21.449> in<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.719> hand

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
does feel really really nice in the hand

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.499 
does feel really really nice in the hand
but<00:04:22.500> also<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.099> because<00:04:23.759> it<00:04:24.030> actually<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.479> a

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
but also but because it actually is a

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.330 
but also but because it actually is a
slider<00:04:24.780> case<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.259> I'm<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.500> huge<00:04:25.800> fan<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:26.009> slider

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
slider case and I'm a huge fan of slider

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.399 
slider case and I'm a huge fan of slider
cases<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.969> really<00:04:27.419> like<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.719> design<00:04:27.840> i<00:04:28.050> really

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
cases I really like the design i really

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.140 
cases I really like the design i really
like<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> idea<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.520> what<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.789> cool<00:04:29.940> things

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
like the idea and what the cool things

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.730 
like the idea and what the cool things
is<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.449> isn't<00:04:30.719> just<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.020> bottom<00:04:31.320> slider<00:04:31.590> it

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
is it isn't just a bottom slider it

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.890 
is it isn't just a bottom slider it
actually<00:04:32.039> slides<00:04:32.280> half<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.820> case<00:04:33.360> open<00:04:33.539> and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
actually slides half the case open and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.240 
actually slides half the case open and
over<00:04:34.139> here<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.320> guys<00:04:34.530> can<00:04:34.800> see<00:04:35.009> from<00:04:35.159> that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
over here you guys can see from that

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.490 
over here you guys can see from that
clip<00:04:35.789> right<00:04:35.969> there<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:36.360> those<00:04:36.960> holes<00:04:37.259> are

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
clip right there then those holes are

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.930 
clip right there then those holes are
perforated<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.219> you<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.460> actually<00:04:38.610> kind<00:04:38.880> of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
perforated so you can actually kind of

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.249 
perforated so you can actually kind of
make<00:04:39.090> out<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.360> color<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.810> phone<00:04:40.020> from
