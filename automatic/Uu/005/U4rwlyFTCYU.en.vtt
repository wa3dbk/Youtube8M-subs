00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.320 
see that it just goes all the way down
so<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.900> one<00:02:34.110> side<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:35.460> LVS<00:02:35.850> are<00:02:36.000> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.240> be

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
so on one side the LVS are going to be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.880 
so on one side the LVS are going to be
upside<00:02:36.810> down<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.170> sides<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.710> two

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
upside down and then the sides are two

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.780 
upside down and then the sides are two
separate<00:02:41.310> pieces<00:02:43.940> there<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.270> then<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.960> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.880 

this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.330> nice<00:02:51.450> makeup<00:02:51.930> bag<00:02:52.140> they

buy<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.070> I've<00:02:56.070> had<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> few<00:02:56.700> years<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.420> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
buy it I've had it for a few years but I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.150 
buy it I've had it for a few years but I
know<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.990> I've<00:02:58.110> seen<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.740> pretty<00:02:58.890> sure

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
know that I've seen it I'm pretty sure

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340 
know that I've seen it I'm pretty sure
I've<00:02:59.310> seen<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.670> online<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.630> also<00:03:00.810> comes<00:03:01.140> in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
I've seen is online and it also comes in

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.199 
I've seen is online and it also comes in
I<00:03:01.560> think<00:03:01.680> three<00:03:02.130> different<00:03:02.490> sizes<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.150> is

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
I think three different sizes this is

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.870 
I think three different sizes this is
the<00:03:03.930> smallest<00:03:04.260> size<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> comes<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.370> but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
the smallest size that it comes in but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
the smallest size that it comes in but
like<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.180> said<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.510> really<00:03:06.570> roomy<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.670> it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
like I said it's really roomy and it's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.770 
like I said it's really roomy and it's
really<00:03:08.910> sturdy<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.270> lot<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.600> use

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
really sturdy and I like it a lot I use

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.540 
really sturdy and I like it a lot I use
it<00:03:12.930> every<00:03:13.140> day<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.950> leathers<00:03:14.310> really

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
it every day and the leathers really

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.930 
it every day and the leathers really
strong<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.209> holds<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.660> really<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.910> I

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
strong and it holds up really well so I

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.540 
strong and it holds up really well so I
