00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.380
 with his 75 horses 6,800 cubic centimeters the general gilles pelisson the 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.400
 sets new standards for the sporty maxi-scooter segment 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.700
 the Tamil tigers if max 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.069
 the category 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.369
 nothing is less sure especially as the famous bassist 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.339
 for this year 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.820
 you participated 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 Halff 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.330
 firstly his duel at the top the design and design 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.260
 the two behemoths 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.510
 mitarai to date 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.370
 designed with motors 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 6 he also names 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 most sprinters 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040
 the templates are pretty close with very similar dimensions the team axis 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.540
 however stands out by volumes a little more imposing while the gp800 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.620
 seems a little more fluid and especially narrower 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.450
 this finesse does not necessarily play in favor of Italian 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.920
 since its slender front end protects me these mounted parts alone 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 goal and max wider and especially endowed with an imposing by ear 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.440
 if can not match the gamma the gilera catches up with its windshield 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.010
 height adjustable 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 be careful, however, to engines that are struggling a little at high speed 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.080
 On the finishing side, mac tea is highlighted thanks to its concern for 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 permanent detail 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.650
 a little less gp800 is still a beautiful as in 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.020
 testifies its double tailpipe or are pretty fires 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.630
 back to leds 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 overall the practical details are a little more numerous on yamaha who 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 benefit for example pocket quote 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.000
 on its side the gpu seems to have no additional storage but we 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 know all the same accor must study well with a key that command 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.860
 remote opening 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.960
 in one case as in the other the capacity is quite limited since 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 only houses a small, full-face helmet 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.659
 once in the saddle the atmosphere is quite sporty the vest report poses by 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.729
 example openwork handlebar aluminum instrumentation is quite complete and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.729
 the display can be controlled directly in viral video 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.590
 on its side the action theme and a block counters rimmed with chrome everything 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 as complete it's not worth much to get around 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.040
 the first rounds of the wheels general gilles pelisson catches up however his 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.399
 delay thanks to its fabulous engine block 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.529
 more powerful of all diets but also more responsive at startup 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.529
 it also allows you to take the lead in terms of performance 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.109
 for example we record a top speed of 186 km hour and 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:34.920
 against only 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.029
 163 for the team 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.330
 the Italian also takes to the hip at the 200 meters standing start 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.969
 with more than one second 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.479
 so far the kid has benefited from a formidable new century part 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.660
 more precise and more efficient and durable better than theirs 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.929
 it offers a dynamic behavior of a rare effectiveness 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.929
 far from the new gp12 shaped a little outdated on 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.679
 especially as subsidies a little 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.239
 but that does not hold 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 anyway we now have the choice of weapons 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.339
 General 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.520
 certainly a little less powerful 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.339
 this is unacceptable 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.299
 we say that the general does not respond with a much more powerful engine 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.099
 to each his priorities
