 appreciate there has been a drop in money 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 massive which has affected all 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 seen that we have lowered the money but 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.440

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.690
 Roses has put that hard with us 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 with the users of gta 5 what happens that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 if I now blige that money trick 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.850
 they are going to be able to finish fighting me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 some risk of being shot for good 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.489
 doubts like those are the ones that come after 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 solve in this video that they are little 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.670
 and nothing, I'm going to comment on some 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.400
 any doubts 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.380
 of those and trying to solve the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.790
 If you have any doubt that does not say 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.980
 this video for the comments and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.480
 I'll try to solve it, so it's worth nothing 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.940
 Well, having said that, we are going to comment 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.800
 and it's good that first thing we have 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 risk today to be bathed in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 xerez to 5 online 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
 Well, really the only ones that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.900
 they have risks to be shot and with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 banned I mean being kicked out of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 gta 5 online is to say that I do not leave you anymore 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.260
 connect with that account that already 5 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.420
 online so those who have risks the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.820
 banned are the hackers I'll explain 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 why then the hackers have to have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 to be shot because they modify 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.530
 the game what do I mean with this then 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 that they for example are in a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 heading says look now I want that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 the people for killing for docking a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.180
 store instead of a thousand dollars that is like 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
 he has rocks on him as much as he 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.060
 rockstar has programmed that when it's 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.830
 which is a store, take you 1500 dollars 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 because as I want as I am a hacker 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.190
 now I put it to give us 200 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.330
 thousand dollars then it is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.250
 modifying the game we are not 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.080
 modifying the way rockstar 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 has created the game of gta 5 what happens 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.350
 so what to rockstar this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.090
 obviously you do not like it, do not imagine yourself 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.530
 you create you make a game you do not make a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.180
 game for people to play and 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 Now someone comes and oysters 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.850
 changes and people have to play like 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.520
 that person wants to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 being the city of grace then that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 it suits you to rockstar because obviously 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.560
 bathe the spas and expel them from 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.210
 gt5 online for the game to follow the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.100
 course as such and how they planned it 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.670
 when creating the game it does not remain as 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.080
 they like for example as an example 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.080
 then only only 1500 dollars 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.010
 sorry that the only ones who are in danger 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 of baneo are hackers because we 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.430
 we have no danger of panic because 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.540
 us and I say us because I do not 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.950
 I have plays hacked that there are many people 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.810
 what danny says is that you are a hacker and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.489
 have a lot of money, if it was not I had something 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 glitches tricks like you hackers 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.790
 they pass me money just like they do 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.880
 you I am not a hacker and nothing of it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.260
 so what happens then what because 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.690
 we are not varied and we get 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.150
 money illegally in quotation marks 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.540
 because we do not modify the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.430
 game we take advantage of the failures 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 who has the game then good 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.720
 really this if we for example 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 we duplicate a car illegally 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.799
 in quotes I repeat it again 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.269
 it really is not that we have already 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.400
 modified the game but it is a failure 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.610
 of rockstar and if we get 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.650
 money 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.300
 how to say it part of a failure of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.090
 rockstar because obviously the fault is 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.650
 rockstar is not the fault of our 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.580
 balance is not our fault but this 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.380
 has a flaw in the game 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 obviously the fault is yours, not if 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.710
 we take advantage of that failure to 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.390
 get money so guys that 's 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.740
 the dam was a villa I wanted to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.510
 of course because a lot of people putting it 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.960
 the comments and that is that you do not have 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.550
 risk of being banned but if you use 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.560
 tricks and clichÃ©s for 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.150
 money if today rock star has 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.459
 tucked in as a kind of how to say 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.900
 the locators which make 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 good now all those who have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.450
 lowered the money already you have installed in 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.760
 your user a kind of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.950
 locator which makes good if 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.290
 you get a lot of money in a period of 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.730
 a very short period of time then to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.830
 rockstar I suppose there in their 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.330
 offices because it will jump in the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.280
 computers and such in the statistics of 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.590
 the users of gta 5 because it jumps 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.530
 some kind of alarm so to speak 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.660
 Y 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.430
 that person who has got money 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.319
 a lot of money in that short period of 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.700
 time then rockstar will lower all the 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.590
 money earned in that period of 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.090
 time then what do we do 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.069
 we believe that we believe it because 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.840
 really if you start thinking what 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.180
 rockstar have to be attentive to each 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.250
 one of the users of gta 5 online and 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.380
 see if they use tricks or do not use 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.390
 tricks really is a bit difficult not 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.220
 of being attentive to each user then 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.750
 Well I really suspect I suspect 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.340
 that this message that we have been sent 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.350
 that we have located and that each 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 everything we do can have some 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.880
 retaliation etcetera etcetera I said 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.650
 that this really can be a something 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.210
 to load not to get scared and that 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.530
 really this is not going to be like that because 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.000
 fuck is that silence could 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.830
 think about it think how many users 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.060
 there is playing keita 5 online 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830
 imagine you rockstar that has to be 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.330
 pending of each one of them 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.590
 is that it would be very difficult is not 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.120
 Pending everyone to see it 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.260
 uses a trick the truth did to the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.640
 guys then put me for the comments 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.870
 your opinion that looks fix a lot 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.610
 is the comments of this video to see 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.200
 if I want to see different points of 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.760
 view of my subscribers and see what 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440
 you think to see if we get some 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.060
 deduction of all this something or something like that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.800
