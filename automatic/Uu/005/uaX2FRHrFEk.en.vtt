00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.780
 later to see are read a living book 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.519
 practical clear character in space by 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.300
 next to the lizard of luck 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.070
 but he did not see her with his yesterday and sponge 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.740
 encapsulated estimen who took the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.320
 language to draw fell skulls from 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.780
 aliens is in heaven gave great base dried 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.590
 the face and Clarence's father forgot 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.180
 of going to look for him at school 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 you forgot to pick me up at the school of a 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.190
 mountain and then 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 ah 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.620
 Clear 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.620
 another week in cardboard 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 very good friends what gives soul 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.170
 calm down, live, try to tame a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 monster with twigs potatoes potato chips 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.450
 I returned the family to me yes and luckily 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 monster also liked everything came 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.130
 coming out of wonder when suddenly 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.490
 and I was curious to know if at 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.030
 seagulls like the chips in the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.100
 real world 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.220
 so I went to the beach with chips and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.869
 I could see that if they love and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.880
 I also wanted to know if the monster of 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.270
 real world likes but I did not dare 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 about 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.020
 today in analyzing things there is everything to 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.579
 analyze to start a project box 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.619
 in the wall of a shadow shaped like 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.689
 clarence and I could see that in the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.679
 real world is not like clarence 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.679
 but if we open 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 On the other hand I discovered that when Darwin 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.659
 and rope are far away draw them 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.689
 like two little squares as you can see 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.409
 here and here they also continued to appear 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.649
 caritas in things like this house and in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.960
 this ladder or in the torso of skips 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.480
 hello in this palette that has caritas 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.070
 and in this video game convention note 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 that this lady in violet was 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.120
 repeated but when I started to see better 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.930
 I realized that everyone was 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 transmitted as here and here 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.109
 at the end it was a convention of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.109
 video games or twins 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.280
 it's not funny 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.560
 since he found a fly in his soup and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.510
 instead of just shooing the the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.450
 he killed so he came back in the form of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.130
 ghost to take revenge and I wonder how 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.150
 it may be that nobody has made a 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.150
 movie about this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.680
 after a sharp soup do not you dare to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.030
 kill her 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.740
 the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 the ghost fly 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.450
 no way 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.450
 this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.920
 before the world 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.290
 become music 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.750
 special participation of lie as 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.860
 the mysterious paranormal detective and 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.520
 sarastro wave as the fly the fly 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.930
 ghost the buzz of the dragon 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.790

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.379
 Listen 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.530
 will stay looking at the ceiling for 15 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.530
 minutes 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.030
 today I consider that if a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.100
 lost locker 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.230
 as we have been reporting since 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.750
 weeks are still disappearing things from 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.850
 the cartoons were also voted 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.500
 things are lost in this city if 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.720
 we have been noticing for a while 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.490
 but the disappearance of the locker was 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.860
 only one of several mysteries of this 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.810
 week how to know how it has been launched 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.870
 to eat chips with a mushroom in the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.290
 Mouth because this young woman is dressed 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.120
 same as cj 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.600
 or if this glove has two red buttons 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 or six as seen here 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
 Clarence appreciated the sunset 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.900
 quietly without imagining that the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.140
 face of a man with glasses was not 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.140
 observing 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.139
 and know whose face it is 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.520
 and let it be and 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.520
 the mystery of 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.100
 weeks are the centaur teenager 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.370

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.980

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:07.520

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.180
 we learned this week that uncle grampa 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.520
 it was pong that a wet trunk is very 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.740
 heavy for a backpack that boxes 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.110
 they make shades of wine that the seagulls 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.320
 they like the chips that several 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.300
 characters can stretch their arm a lot 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.980
 that if they cut off the tail the man will 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.990
 grow back 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.940
 Gis circle avoids the attack of the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.680
 ghost music but in the real world 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.460
 Cats can not avoid 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.460
 sit down 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.700
