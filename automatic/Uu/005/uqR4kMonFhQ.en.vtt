00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
were two examples of night forks black

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
were two examples of night forks black
one<00:01:27.900> first<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.650> white<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:30.000> at

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
one first and then white now look at

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.260 
one first and then white now look at
let's<00:01:30.630> look<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:32.270> advanced

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
let's look at a little more advanced

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
let's look at a little more advanced
example<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.220> couple<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.310> pieces<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
example a couple more pieces on the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
example a couple more pieces on the
board<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.750> case<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.470> White's<00:01:38.100> turn<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
board in this case it is White's turn to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.080 
board in this case it is White's turn to
move<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:40.350> looking<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> night<00:01:41.579> for

white which is right there and so work

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
white which is right there and so work
in<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.000> night<00:01:45.299> move<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.049> perform<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.710> pretty

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
in that night move to perform a pretty

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
with okay you might have seen that if

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
with okay you might have seen that if
this<00:01:55.290> night<00:01:55.590> moved<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.369> he's<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.299> attacking

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
this night moved here he's now attacking

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
this night moved here he's now attacking
the<00:01:58.380> rook<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.490> king<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.860> Queen<00:02:02.280> okay

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the rook the king and the Queen okay

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
the rook the king and the Queen okay
again<00:02:03.210> attacking<00:02:03.659> three<00:02:04.110> pieces<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.829> time

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
again attacking three pieces at one time

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.089 
again attacking three pieces at one time
and<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.420> our<00:02:06.570> last<00:02:06.780> example<00:02:07.099> once

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and just like our last example once

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.619 
and just like our last example once
since<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> king<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.000> danger<00:02:09.030> once<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
since the king is in danger once you

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.820 
since the king is in danger once you
move<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.800> Queen<00:02:11.069> would<00:02:11.610> be

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
move the Queen would be

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.180 
move the Queen would be
I'm<00:02:12.360> okay<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.540> little<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.190> advanced

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
I'm okay a little bit more advanced

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.950 
I'm okay a little bit more advanced
example<00:02:15.850> couple<00:02:16.060> more<00:02:16.150> pieces<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.660> now<00:02:16.750> we'll

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
example couple more pieces and now we'll

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.120 
example couple more pieces and now we'll
get<00:02:17.200> our<00:02:17.410> last<00:02:18.040> example<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:20.130> is

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
get our last example and this one is

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.590 
get our last example and this one is
definitely<00:02:21.460> more<00:02:21.820> advanced<00:02:22.120> when<00:02:22.300> they<00:02:22.390> flip

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
definitely more advanced when they flip

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.060 
definitely more advanced when they flip
the<00:02:22.720> board<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> give<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> proper

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
the board for you to give you proper

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.090 
the board for you to give you proper
perspective<00:02:24.370> okay<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.600> time<00:02:25.840> were<00:02:26.230> playing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
perspective okay this time were playing

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.080 
perspective okay this time were playing
as<00:02:27.400> black<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.650> what<00:02:30.580> we<00:02:30.670> notice<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.000> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
as black so what we notice in this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.420 
as black so what we notice in this
position<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.810> here's<00:02:32.710> our<00:02:32.860> night<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.310> we're

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
position is here's our night that we're

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.710 
position is here's our night that we're
going<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.580> use<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:33.970> fork<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.570> see

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
going to use for the fork and we see

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
going to use for the fork and we see
that<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.080> night<00:02:35.290> could<00:02:36.010> immediately<00:02:36.370> attack

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that the night could immediately attack

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
that the night could immediately attack
this<00:02:37.180> rook<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.110> that's<00:02:38.290> actually<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.890> what

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
this rook but that's actually not what

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.190 
this rook but that's actually not what
we<00:02:39.310> want<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.670> we're<00:02:39.880> looking<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> more

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
we want to do we're looking for a more

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.530 
we want to do we're looking for a more
powerful<00:02:41.730> attack<00:02:42.730> than<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.390> more

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
powerful attack than that and more

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.240 
powerful attack than that and more
powerful<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:44.710> not<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.980> fork

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
powerful for that's actually not a fork

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.710 
powerful for that's actually not a fork
that's<00:02:45.400> just<00:02:45.640> an<00:02:45.730> attack<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.450> we're<00:02:46.630> looking

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that's just an attack so we're looking

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.280 
that's just an attack so we're looking
for<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.080> powerful<00:02:47.560> fork<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:49.150> what<00:02:50.110> are<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
for a powerful fork so what are the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.640 
for a powerful fork so what are the
possibilities<00:02:50.740> in<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.670> case<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:53.290> see<00:02:53.470> that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
possibilities in this case we see that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.620 
possibilities in this case we see that
as<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:53.890> night<00:02:54.190> was<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.209> move<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:56.760> then<00:02:57.760> he

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
as this night was to move here then he

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.010 
as this night was to move here then he
would<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.930> attacking<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.700> king<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.780> he

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
would be attacking the king but he

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.840 
would be attacking the king but he
wouldn't<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:02.380> attacking<00:03:02.830> anything<00:03:03.040> else<00:03:03.400> so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
wouldn't be attacking anything else so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.360 
wouldn't be attacking anything else so
for<00:03:04.330> attacks<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.140> pieces<00:03:05.590> or<00:03:05.860> multiple<00:03:06.190> pieces

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
for attacks to pieces or multiple pieces

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.100 
for attacks to pieces or multiple pieces
at<00:03:06.580> once<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.120> case<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
at once in that case is just one so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.710 
at once in that case is just one so
that's<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> fork<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:10.000> can<00:03:10.270> see<00:03:10.540> that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
that's not the fork but we can see that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.380 
that's not the fork but we can see that
this<00:03:10.840> night<00:03:11.050> was<00:03:11.170> jump<00:03:11.500> here<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.880> he'd<00:03:13.300> be

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
this night was jump here that he'd be

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.380 
this night was jump here that he'd be
attacking<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.810> King<00:03:14.050> as<00:03:14.350> we<00:03:14.560> see<00:03:14.770> but<00:03:15.070> if<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
attacking the King as we see but if the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.780 
attacking the King as we see but if the
Queen<00:03:16.780> was<00:03:17.019> on<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.380> square<00:03:17.830> he<00:03:18.280> also<00:03:18.489> be

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
Queen was on this square he also be

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.400 
Queen was on this square he also be
attacking<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.330> Queen<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.780> would<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:20.019> forking

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
attacking that Queen it would be forking

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.070 
attacking that Queen it would be forking
them<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> how<00:03:21.790> can<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.970> force<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.510> Queen<00:03:22.810> onto

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
them so how can we force the Queen onto

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.229 
them so how can we force the Queen onto
that<00:03:23.170> square<00:03:23.590> well<00:03:24.489> here's<00:03:24.640> what<00:03:24.820> we<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.090> do

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
that square well here's what we can do

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.890 
that square well here's what we can do
if<00:03:25.600> black<00:03:26.080> puts<00:03:26.440> his<00:03:26.560> rook<00:03:26.830> down<00:03:27.100> there<00:03:27.900> you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
if black puts his rook down there you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.080 
if black puts his rook down there you
see<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.830> rook<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.280> threatening<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
see that the rook is threatening the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.390 
see that the rook is threatening the
king<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> king<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.200> in<00:03:32.290> check<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.800> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
king and so the king is in check and the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
king and so the king is in check and the
King<00:03:33.640> can't<00:03:33.910> move<00:03:34.180> anywhere<00:03:34.800> because<00:03:35.800> all<00:03:36.130> of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
King can't move anywhere because all of

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.830 
King can't move anywhere because all of
these<00:03:36.519> squares<00:03:37.209> are<00:03:39.239> being<00:03:40.239> attacked<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.720> he

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
these squares are being attacked and he

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.449 
these squares are being attacked and he
can't<00:03:41.080> get<00:03:41.230> out<00:03:41.290> cuz<00:03:41.530> his<00:03:41.650> pawns<00:03:41.890> are<00:03:42.070> blocking

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
can't get out cuz his pawns are blocking

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.350 
can't get out cuz his pawns are blocking
him<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:44.170> he<00:03:44.440> has<00:03:44.620> nowhere<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.459> go<00:03:45.489> but<00:03:46.120> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
him so he has nowhere to go but the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.780 
him so he has nowhere to go but the
Queen<00:03:46.690> has<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.170> help<00:03:47.320> out<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.130> when<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.489> Queen

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
Queen has to help out so when the Queen

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.449 
Queen has to help out so when the Queen
takes<00:03:49.540> rook<00:03:49.989> again<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.950> Queen<00:03:51.160> had<00:03:51.280> no

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
takes rook again the Queen had no

options<00:03:51.850> there<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.750> see<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.620> fork

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920

options there now we see that the fork
that<00:03:54.160> we<00:03:54.250> were<00:03:54.340> looking<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.640> before<00:03:55.300> is<00:03:55.690> set

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that we were looking for before is set

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.320 
that we were looking for before is set
up<00:03:56.050> by<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.739> night<00:03:57.070> light<00:03:57.700> hops<00:03:57.940> into<00:03:58.209> the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
up by this night light hops into the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.930 
up by this night light hops into the
appropriate<00:03:58.630> position<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.590> now<00:04:00.310> attacking

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
appropriate position and now attacking

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.560 
appropriate position and now attacking
the<00:04:01.330> Queen<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:01.959> king<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.040> again<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.390> we

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
the Queen and the king and again as we

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.090 
the Queen and the king and again as we
saw<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.870> for<00:04:05.050> all<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> previous<00:04:05.530> examples<00:04:05.950> when

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
saw it for all a previous examples when

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.699 
saw it for all a previous examples when
the<00:04:06.190> King<00:04:06.370> has<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.700> get<00:04:06.820> out<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:06.940> danger<00:04:07.709> can

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
the King has to get out of danger can

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.520 
the King has to get out of danger can
move<00:04:08.890> there<00:04:09.280> Knight<00:04:09.940> takes<00:04:10.150> clean<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
move there Knight takes clean and the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.210 
move there Knight takes clean and the
fork<00:04:11.830> is<00:04:11.980> complete<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:13.739> are<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> couple<00:04:15.040> of

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
fork is complete so that are a couple of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.289 
fork is complete so that are a couple of
those<00:04:15.430> are<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.670> couple<00:04:15.700> examples<00:04:15.970> of

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
those are a couple examples of

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.930 
those are a couple examples of
nightfort's<00:04:16.919> then<00:04:17.919> most<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.580> think<00:04:18.760> all<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
nightfort's then most I think all the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.969 
nightfort's then most I think all the
examples<00:04:19.299> we<00:04:19.419> had<00:04:19.630> were<00:04:19.900> forks<00:04:20.440> against<00:04:20.709> the

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
examples we had were forks against the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.950 
examples we had were forks against the
enemy<00:04:21.280> King<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:22.060> doesn't<00:04:22.330> have<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.539> be<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.660> for
