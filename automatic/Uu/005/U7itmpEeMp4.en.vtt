00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the one thing I did notice I thought the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.860 
the one thing I did notice I thought the
insert<00:02:35.860> was<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:37.540> thin<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.709> really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
insert was really thin it's really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.050 
insert was really thin it's really
really<00:02:41.100> perforated<00:02:42.100> too<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.910> kind<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:45.060> has

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
really perforated too so it kind of has

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.009 
really perforated too so it kind of has
a<00:02:46.090> lot<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.330> venting

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
a lot of venting

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:57.900 
a lot of venting

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the New Balance and the North wave would

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.420 
the New Balance and the North wave would
