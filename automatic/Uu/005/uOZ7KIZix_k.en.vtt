that<00:00:31.429> it's<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.329> little<00:00:32.720> tricky<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.560> hold<00:00:34.130> on

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
that it's a little tricky to hold on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.310 
that it's a little tricky to hold on
just<00:00:35.000> be<00:00:35.150> back<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.570> get<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.720> little<00:00:35.840> rough<00:00:36.110> for

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
just be back and get a little rough for

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.709 
just be back and get a little rough for
a<00:00:36.350> little<00:00:36.560> boat<00:00:36.680> like<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:37.760> ideally<00:00:38.539> I

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
a little boat like this so ideally I

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.470 
a little boat like this so ideally I
would<00:00:38.809> like<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.050> have<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.199> place<00:00:39.410> for<00:00:39.440> them<00:00:43.480> so

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
would like to have a place for them so

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.500 
would like to have a place for them so
ordinarily<00:00:44.930> what<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.199> would<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.800> use<00:00:46.510> a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
ordinarily what I would do is use a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930 
ordinarily what I would do is use a
piece<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.870> plywood<00:00:48.019> marine-grade<00:00:48.530> plywood<00:00:48.940> go

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
piece of plywood marine-grade plywood go

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.939 
piece of plywood marine-grade plywood go
to<00:00:50.000> clear<00:00:50.300> coat<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:50.690> epoxy<00:00:50.929> and<00:00:51.590> use<00:00:51.769> that

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
to clear coat it with epoxy and use that

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.079 
to clear coat it with epoxy and use that
as<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.399> backing<00:00:52.789> plane<00:00:57.640> raining<00:00:58.640> day<00:00:58.789> forward

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
as the backing plane raining day forward

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.990 
as the backing plane raining day forward
I've<00:00:59.420> been<00:00:59.570> using<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.160> 850<00:01:01.160> BC<00:01:01.339> turn<00:01:01.699> board

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
I've been using that 850 BC turn board

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.459 
I've been using that 850 BC turn board
that<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.239> pick<00:01:02.480> up<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:02.719> home<00:01:03.289> people

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
that you can pick up at home people

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:15.539 
that you can pick up at home people
anywhere<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:06.460> it's<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.520> bit<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.760> an<00:01:07.820> experiment

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.990 

I've<00:01:16.549> made<00:01:16.790> these<00:01:17.350> backing<00:01:18.350> blocks<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:18.830> this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
I've made these backing blocks for this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.039 
I've made these backing blocks for this
these<00:01:20.000> go<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.509> underside<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.900> the

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
these go on the underside of the

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.520 
these go on the underside of the
fiberglass<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.830> use<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.780> PVC<00:01:23.780> board<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:24.380> was

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
fiberglass I use the PVC board I was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.240 
fiberglass I use the PVC board I was
talking<00:01:24.830> about<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:27.200> don't<00:01:27.290> have<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.590> be<00:01:28.070> too
