about piano power cords and this was a

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.249 
about piano power cords and this was a
serious<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.120> was<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> write<00:00:06.450> myself<00:00:06.750> but

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
serious I was going to write myself but

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.470 
serious I was going to write myself but
I<00:00:07.350> stumbled<00:00:07.770> across<00:00:07.830> an<00:00:08.220> American<00:00:08.639> guy<00:00:08.760> who

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
I stumbled across an American guy who

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.419 
I stumbled across an American guy who
had<00:00:09.599> already<00:00:10.019> done<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.800> rather<00:00:11.160> than

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
had already done it so rather than

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.160 
had already done it so rather than
reinvent<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> wheel<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.660> thought<00:00:12.900> I'd

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
reinvent the wheel I thought I'd

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.609 
reinvent the wheel I thought I'd
introduce<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:14.340> 39<00:00:14.849> power<00:00:15.750> cord<00:00:16.049> lessons<00:00:16.410> to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
introduce these 39 power cord lessons to

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.429 
introduce these 39 power cord lessons to
you<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.070> anybody<00:00:17.940> who's<00:00:18.270> had<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> tinker<00:00:19.350> with

you and anybody who's had a tinker with

you and anybody who's had a tinker with
the<00:00:19.560> piano<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:19.920> probably<00:00:20.250> come<00:00:20.369> across

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the piano would probably come across

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.100 
the piano would probably come across
this<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.029> instance

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.200 

which<00:00:28.110> is<00:00:28.260> perhaps<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> most<00:00:29.210> simple

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
which is perhaps one of the most simple

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.520 
which is perhaps one of the most simple
chord<00:00:30.810> sequences<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.970> put

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
chord sequences and and but you can put

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.390 
chord sequences and and but you can put
literally<00:00:34.530> dozens<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:34.950> dozens<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.309> different

literally dozens and dozens of different

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040 
literally dozens and dozens of different
tunes<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.970> look<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> blue<00:00:36.629> moon<00:00:36.840> with

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
tunes to look like a blue moon with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
and so so that's just one example of the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.690 
and so so that's just one example of the
many<00:00:49.360> different<00:00:50.250> modules<00:00:51.250> that<00:00:51.340> this<00:00:51.520> guy

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
subtlety of the major 7th like we had in

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.410 
subtlety of the major 7th like we had in

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.070 

that<00:01:45.400> was<00:01:45.520> revolutionary<00:01:46.150> then<00:01:46.360> these<00:01:46.690> this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
that was revolutionary then these this

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.780 
that was revolutionary then these this
an<00:01:47.200> idea<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.560> having<00:01:47.680> these<00:01:47.920> very<00:01:48.460> subtle

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
an idea of having these very subtle

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.130 
an idea of having these very subtle
movements<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:49.300> courts<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:49.840> that's<00:01:49.990> been

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
movements in courts so that's been

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.320 
movements in courts so that's been
covered<00:01:50.320> as<00:01:50.530> well<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.460> then<00:01:52.000> you'll<00:01:52.150> have

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
covered as well and then you'll have

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.910 
covered as well and then you'll have
lovely<00:01:52.690> progressions<00:01:53.230> like<00:01:53.470> Paul

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
lovely progressions like Paul

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
lovely progressions like Paul
McCartney's<00:01:54.340> yesterday<00:01:54.790> for<00:01:55.000> instance

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.820 

is<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:09.179> beautiful<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.380> cause<00:02:10.619> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
is now beautiful and then cause with

is now beautiful and then cause with
your<00:02:10.860> based<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.120> base<00:02:12.360> note<00:02:12.630> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
your based just on one base note so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
your based just on one base note so
you've<00:02:13.020> got<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> bass<00:02:13.349> note<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.770> plays

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
you've got a bass note that plays

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.280 
you've got a bass note that plays
consistently<00:02:15.209> through<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> whole<00:02:15.750> series<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.460 
consistently through the whole series of
chords<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.940> chords<00:02:18.599> take<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
chords and the chords take on a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.110 
chords and the chords take on a
different<00:02:19.590> texture<00:02:20.099> depending<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:21.000> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
different texture depending on how it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.800 
different texture depending on how it
hits<00:02:21.480> against<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.050> bass<00:02:22.230> note

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.360

a very simple C chord then the bass note
moves

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240

Oh

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.040 

of<00:04:37.550> course<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.910> was<00:04:38.030> used<00:04:38.270> on<00:04:38.450> whiter<00:04:38.900> shade

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
of course that was used on whiter shade

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.110 
of course that was used on whiter shade
of<00:04:39.320> pale<00:04:39.440> exactly<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> same<00:04:40.520> they<00:04:40.730> need<00:04:40.940> to
