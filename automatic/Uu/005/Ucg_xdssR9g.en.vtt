00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
four bolts we just installed definitely

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.469 
four bolts we just installed definitely
a<00:01:47.979> good<00:01:48.130> idea<00:01:48.340> gettext<00:01:48.759> set<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.970> hands<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.360> help

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
a good idea gettext set of hands to help

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.359 
a good idea gettext set of hands to help
hold<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.840> position<00:01:50.100> while<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.159> line<00:01:51.340> up

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
hold it in position while you line up

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
hold it in position while you line up
two<00:01:51.520> bolt<00:01:51.700> holes<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.149> install<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.659> hardware

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
two bolt holes and install the hardware

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.580 
two bolt holes and install the hardware
it's<00:01:54.520> good<00:01:54.640> idea<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> push<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.360> hitch<00:01:55.590> forward

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
it's good idea to push the hitch forward

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.999 
it's good idea to push the hitch forward
a<00:01:56.649> little<00:01:56.770> bit

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
a little bit

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.429 
a little bit
then<00:01:57.399> pull<00:01:57.670> over<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.689> bolts<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.350> are

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
then pull over the bolts that are

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.950 
then pull over the bolts that are
located<00:01:59.679> in<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.890> front<00:01:59.920> bottom<00:02:00.429> of<00:02:00.549> a<00:02:00.610> frame

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
located in the front bottom of a frame

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.959 
located in the front bottom of a frame
by<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> tie-down<00:02:02.289> bracket<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.640> pull<00:02:03.909> it

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
by a tie-down bracket then pull it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.480 
by a tie-down bracket then pull it
forward<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.450> we<00:02:04.539> can<00:02:04.659> line<00:02:04.810> up<00:02:04.840> our<00:02:05.020> bolts<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
forward so we can line up our bolts and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.400 
forward so we can line up our bolts and
the<00:02:06.640> bolts<00:02:06.909> will<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.299> 1/2<00:02:07.929> inch<00:02:08.080> flange

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the bolts will get to 1/2 inch flange
