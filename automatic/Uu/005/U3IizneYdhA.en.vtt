00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.500

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.000
 other 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.780
 the first signal to catch 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.979

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.460
 so you can see what happens 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.020
 here I think I have to lower them between 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.020

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.480

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.660
 when you get it, this will appear 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.640
 egg is the egg of the sheep according 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.070
 before we have captured a sheep that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.400
 has that name that is the capture of 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.630
 agreement and that will happen to us all 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.300
 we can capture any kind of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 animal is worth a grip but it is a 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.110
 creepers and is a chicken is a chicken 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.650
 we have captured a brother is 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.110
 complicated when stronger or more 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.640
 complicated is worth the neutrals are the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.640

 pokémon you have to press down and 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.650
 pull at the same time so that what 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.720
 they would catch if he did not escape in this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.030
 case expelled and fide everything and nothing is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.300
