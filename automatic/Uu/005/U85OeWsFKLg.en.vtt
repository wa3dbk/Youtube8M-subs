welcome to the wonderful world of
intervals<00:00:08.620> intervals<00:00:09.620> are<00:00:10.070> at<00:00:10.280> every<00:00:10.730> part<00:00:11.030> of

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
intervals intervals are at every part of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.630 
intervals intervals are at every part of
music<00:00:11.389> they<00:00:12.200> are<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.530> molecules<00:00:13.220> that<00:00:13.460> make

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
music they are the molecules that make

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.330 
music they are the molecules that make
up<00:00:13.880> all<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.450> sounds<00:00:14.840> that<00:00:14.870> we<00:00:15.110> know<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.620> good

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
up all the sounds that we know a good

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.060 
up all the sounds that we know a good
example<00:00:16.850> is<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:17.510> major<00:00:17.779> scale<00:00:18.290> the<00:00:18.860> major

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
example is the major scale the major

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.679 
example is the major scale the major
scale<00:00:19.750> played<00:00:20.800> with<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.919> root<00:00:22.130> of<00:00:22.340> C<00:00:22.730> starts

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
scale played with the root of C starts

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.990 
scale played with the root of C starts
with<00:00:23.989> a<00:00:24.200> whole<00:00:24.560> tone<00:00:24.919> and<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.369> whole<00:00:25.520> tone<00:00:25.790> is

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
with a whole tone and the whole tone is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.060 
with a whole tone and the whole tone is
also<00:00:26.329> technically<00:00:26.960> known<00:00:27.290> as<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.619> major

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
also technically known as the major

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.499 
also technically known as the major
second<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.360> don't<00:00:29.890> be<00:00:30.970> there<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.090> have<00:00:32.239> two

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
second so don't be there you have two

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.660 
second so don't be there you have two
whole<00:00:32.720> tones<00:00:33.310> doremi<00:00:34.310> for<00:00:35.949> there<00:00:36.949> you<00:00:37.160> have<00:00:37.370> a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
whole tones doremi for there you have a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.029 
whole tones doremi for there you have a
half<00:00:37.969> note<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:38.960> known<00:00:39.199> as<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.769> minor

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
half note and that is known as the minor

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.200 
half note and that is known as the minor
second<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:41.570> have<00:00:41.840> two<00:00:42.519> old<00:00:43.519> tones

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
second so you have two old tones

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.110 
second so you have two old tones
followed<00:00:44.840> by<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.050> half<00:00:45.320> note<00:00:45.820> followed<00:00:46.820> by

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
followed by a half note followed by

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.840 
followed by a half note followed by
another<00:00:47.359> whole<00:00:47.660> tone<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.949> another<00:00:49.309> whole<00:00:49.579> tone

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
another whole tone in another whole tone

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.990 
another whole tone in another whole tone
another<00:00:50.570> whole<00:00:50.839> tone<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.679> half<00:00:51.920> note<00:00:52.280> so

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
another whole tone and a half note so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.340 
another whole tone and a half note so

second<00:01:01.640> minor<00:01:02.030> second<00:01:03.190> another<00:01:04.190> example<00:01:04.909> is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
second minor second another example is

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.650 
second minor second another example is
if<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.130> take<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.610> baseline<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:10.040> instance<00:01:10.660> this

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
if you take a baseline for instance this

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:24.450 
if you take a baseline for instance this
one<00:01:11.930> here<00:01:21.430> Billie<00:01:22.430> Jean<00:01:22.850> by<00:01:23.150> Michael<00:01:23.450> Jackson

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
one here Billie Jean by Michael Jackson

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.330 
one here Billie Jean by Michael Jackson
so<00:01:25.460> if<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.850> break<00:01:26.300> this<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:26.810> down<00:01:27.220> look<00:01:28.220> at

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
so if you break this one down look at

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.040 
so if you break this one down look at
your<00:01:28.580> root<00:01:28.760> which<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.300> f<00:01:29.540> sharp<00:01:29.570> ah<00:01:31.750> drops<00:01:32.750> down

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
your root which is f sharp ah drops down

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.930 
your root which is f sharp ah drops down
a<00:01:33.110> perfect<00:01:33.800> fourth<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.500> next<00:01:36.860> note

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
a perfect fourth the next note

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.270 
a perfect fourth the next note
is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> minor<00:01:39.750> third<00:01:41.810> followed<00:01:42.810> by

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is a minor third followed by

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.900 
is a minor third followed by
am<00:01:44.820> i<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> major<00:01:45.450> second<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.720> root<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
am i a major second so you have root to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.719 
am i a major second so you have root to
down<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.940> fourth<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.230> minor<00:01:52.440> third<00:01:52.800> up<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
down a fourth up a minor third up a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
down a fourth up a minor third up a
major<00:01:53.940> second<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:57.090> goes<00:01:57.300> back<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.600> again<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
major second it goes back down again and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.120 
major second it goes back down again and
there<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.720> C<00:02:03.930> sharp<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.590> B<00:02:04.860> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
there you have the C sharp to the B is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.180 
there you have the C sharp to the B is
another<00:02:05.310> major<00:02:05.820> second<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.710> say<00:02:07.920> yeah

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
another major second so you can say yeah

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.980 
another major second so you can say yeah
that<00:02:08.220> baseline<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.030> made<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.660> major

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
that baseline is made up of major

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.620 
that baseline is made up of major
seconds<00:02:10.679> minor<00:02:11.009> thirds<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.730> fourths<00:02:12.060> Billy

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630

Dee<00:02:39.320> jumps<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> octave<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.940> one

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
Dee jumps to the octave this is one

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.490 
Dee jumps to the octave this is one
octave<00:02:42.570> right<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.140> doo<00:02:43.680> doo<00:02:43.860> dee<00:02:44.400> dee<00:02:44.459> did

from<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.310> root<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.980> whole<00:02:49.980> tone<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
from the root this is a whole tone a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610 
from the root this is a whole tone a
major<00:02:51.810> second<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.459> root<00:02:53.959> octave<00:02:54.959> major

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
major second so the root octave major

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
major second so the root octave major
second<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.930> minor<00:02:58.440> second<00:02:59.299> right<00:03:00.299> here

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
second then a minor second right here

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.140 
second then a minor second right here
also<00:03:01.290> known<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> half<00:03:01.980> note<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:08.880> all

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
also known as a half note so that's all

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.630 
also known as a half note so that's all
that<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.540> made<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.230> three<00:03:10.590> intervals<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that is made up of three intervals the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.440 
that is made up of three intervals the
octave<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:13.530> major<00:03:13.799> second<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.239> minor

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
octave the major second and the minor

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.750 
octave the major second and the minor
second<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.709> what<00:03:17.100> creates<00:03:17.579> that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
second and that is what creates that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.319 
second and that is what creates that
sound<00:03:18.209> now<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.380> very<00:03:19.650> important<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:21.030> start

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
sound now it's very important to start

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.170 
sound now it's very important to start
to<00:03:21.510> understand<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:23.400> intervals<00:03:23.970> you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
to understand that the intervals you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.680 
to understand that the intervals you
choose<00:03:24.739> create<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.130> emotional<00:03:26.820> quality<00:03:27.450> of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
choose create the emotional quality of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.870 
choose create the emotional quality of
the<00:03:28.320> bassline<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.070> you're<00:03:29.220> playing<00:03:29.519> and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the bassline that you're playing and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.850 
the bassline that you're playing and
later<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> course<00:03:31.290> you're<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.620> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
later on in the course you're going to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.539 
later on in the course you're going to
understand<00:03:32.570> how<00:03:33.570> those<00:03:33.840> intervals

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
understand how those intervals

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.789 
understand how those intervals
individually<00:03:35.549> shape<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.750> emotion<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.769> you

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
individually shape that emotion and you

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.610 
individually shape that emotion and you
will<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.670> able<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.970> consciously<00:03:39.660> apply<00:03:40.320> that

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
will be able to consciously apply that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.979 
will be able to consciously apply that
and<00:03:40.860> create<00:03:41.370> lines<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:42.239> fit<00:03:42.540> what<00:03:42.810> you're

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
and create lines that fit what you're

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.979 
and create lines that fit what you're
trying<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> express<00:03:44.570> let's<00:03:45.570> find<00:03:45.870> another

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
trying to express let's find another

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:53.680 
trying to express let's find another
baseline<00:03:46.590> how<00:03:47.100> about<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.549> one<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.150> um

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:06.940 

oh<00:04:02.710> another<00:04:03.710> one<00:04:03.830> bites<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.490> dust<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.680> let's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
oh another one bites the dust so let's

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.430 
oh another one bites the dust so let's
see<00:04:07.160> what<00:04:07.340> we<00:04:07.490> have<00:04:07.640> here<00:04:08.120> always<00:04:08.990> starts<00:04:09.380> with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
see what we have here always starts with

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.620 
see what we have here always starts with
the<00:04:09.680> root<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.460> this<00:04:11.420> case<00:04:11.690> II<00:04:16.360> mm-hmm<00:04:17.420> here's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the root in this case II mm-hmm here's

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.810 
the root in this case II mm-hmm here's
our<00:04:17.750> second<00:04:18.290> note<00:04:18.500> so<00:04:19.070> we're<00:04:19.280> looking<00:04:19.549> at<00:04:19.670> the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
our second note so we're looking at the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.360 
our second note so we're looking at the
distance<00:04:20.239> from<00:04:20.480> here<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.780> here<00:04:21.010> which<00:04:22.010> happens

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
distance from here to here which happens

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.640 
distance from here to here which happens
to<00:04:22.520> be<00:04:22.550> three<00:04:22.970> half<00:04:23.180> notes<00:04:23.570> or<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.840> minor<00:04:24.170> third

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.360 

it<00:04:27.650> goes<00:04:27.860> back<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> root<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.440> then<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:31.250> the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
it goes back to the root and then to the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.760 
it goes back to the root and then to the
a<00:04:31.400> natural<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.420> what<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.110> distance<00:04:35.770> this

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
a natural so what is this distance this

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.330 
a natural so what is this distance this
is<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.580> fourth<00:04:37.910> perfect<00:04:38.840> fourth<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.980> this<00:04:40.160> one

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
is a fourth perfect fourth so this one

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.470 
is a fourth perfect fourth so this one
is<00:04:40.460> made<00:04:40.730> up<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.500> minor<00:04:42.500> thirds<00:04:43.120> whole<00:04:44.120> tones

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
is made up of minor thirds whole tones

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.260 
is made up of minor thirds whole tones
and<00:04:44.780> perfect<00:04:45.380> fourths<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.150> an

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
and perfect fourths so that is an

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.930 
and perfect fourths so that is an
example<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.080> how<00:04:48.230> everything<00:04:49.070> under<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.640> Sun

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
example of how everything under the Sun

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.400 
example of how everything under the Sun
is<00:04:50.210> created<00:04:51.050> by<00:04:51.800> using<00:04:52.130> intervals<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:54.260> the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
is created by using intervals and in the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.140 
is created by using intervals and in the
following<00:04:54.620> course<00:04:55.130> you're<00:04:55.430> going<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.760> learn<00:04:55.940> a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
following course you're going to learn a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.300 
following course you're going to learn a
lot<00:04:56.600> more<00:04:56.660> about<00:04:57.290> them<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:59.030> way<00:04:59.210> they<00:04:59.419> sound

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
lot more about them the way they sound

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.860 
lot more about them the way they sound
separately<00:05:01.310> from<00:05:01.700> each<00:05:01.850> other<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.690> way

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
separately from each other and the way

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.510 
separately from each other and the way
they<00:05:03.140> sound<00:05:03.440> when<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.919> play<00:05:04.130> them<00:05:04.340> together

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
they sound when you play them together

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.940 
they sound when you play them together
which<00:05:05.210> we<00:05:05.510> are<00:05:05.600> going<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.960> explore<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:06.890> the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
which we are going to explore in the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.850 
which we are going to explore in the
next<00:05:07.100> segment
