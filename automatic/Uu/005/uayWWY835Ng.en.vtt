 hello girls ever looking for your mothers grandmothers wardrobe 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.780
 I started well from the family photo album you have seen some garment a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.610
 bag with a dress that she liked a lot and would have liked to rescue 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.710
 from the past because now it is possible and it is that fashion always returns that is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.050
 of course the ascendant will attend in the past to return to the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.430
 currently but there is nothing like a unique and original garment that 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.950
 makes vintage fashion possible in Valencia a new store has been inaugurated 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.320

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.229
 well nothing simply we have tried to make a selection of twelve 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.290
 storms 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.950
 they are going to find from a bag primer of the 60s there are things that do not have 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.980
 brand and we cover a little bit of from the 40s 50 up to 80 defender

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 for us our house is really very similar to the store 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.300
 We did it personally and decided to set up the store and did it a little 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 more to a greater scale 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.429

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.009
 are not objects recovered right now a good press that is not worth 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.340
