kind<00:01:53.219> of<00:01:53.340> sophisticated<00:01:53.549> stuff<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
kind of sophisticated stuff because I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
kind of sophisticated stuff because I
don't<00:01:56.039> know<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> feel<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.520> sometimes<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:57.030> look

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
don't know I feel like sometimes I look

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
don't know I feel like sometimes I look
overdone<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.319> I<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.189> makes

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
overdone when I do that but this makes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.120 
overdone when I do that but this makes
it<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.850> easy<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.929> do<00:02:01.109> a<00:02:01.560> step<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it really easy to do a step that I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
it really easy to do a step that I
usually<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.639> do<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.659> never<00:02:03.840> dare<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
usually don't do and would never dare to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.660 
usually don't do and would never dare to
do<00:02:04.530> without<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:05.039> instruction<00:02:05.219> booklet

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
do without a little instruction booklet

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.770 
do without a little instruction booklet
so<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:05.939> give<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> an<00:02:06.240> instruction<00:02:06.420> booklet

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so they give you an instruction booklet

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.949 
so they give you an instruction booklet
and<00:02:07.190> they<00:02:08.190> basically<00:02:08.369> tell<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and they basically tell you to and I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
and they basically tell you to and I
just<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.470> same<00:02:10.649> brush<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> did<00:02:11.520> too

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
just use the same brush but I did too

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.960 
just use the same brush but I did too
lightly<00:02:11.820> take<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.870> contour<00:02:13.290> shade<00:02:13.790> which<00:02:14.790> is

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
lightly take this contour shade which is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.620

Brown and it's very light and it's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.170 
Brown and it's very light and it's
actually<00:02:27.310> better<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.850> doesn't<00:02:28.060> show<00:02:28.150> up

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
actually better that it doesn't show up

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.450 
actually better that it doesn't show up
on<00:02:28.300> karrimor<00:02:28.720> too<00:02:28.810> much<00:02:28.960> because<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:30.070> doesn't

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
on karrimor too much because it doesn't

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.590 
on karrimor too much because it doesn't
show<00:02:30.550> up<00:02:30.580> too<00:02:30.790> much<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.030> your<00:02:31.120> face<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.510> they

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
show up too much on your face and they

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.700 
show up too much on your face and they
tell<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.930> put<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.110> under<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> cheekbone

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
tell you to put it under the cheekbone

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.680 
tell you to put it under the cheekbone
like<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.460> then<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.210> glittery

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
like that and then you get a glittery

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.810 
like that and then you get a glittery
blush<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.590> again<00:02:35.800> these<00:02:35.890> are<00:02:35.950> super<00:02:36.550> creamy

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
blush and again these are super creamy

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.540 
blush and again these are super creamy
formula<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.780> not<00:02:37.930> at<00:02:38.050> all<00:02:38.140> powdery<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.680> I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
formula is not at all powdery and I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.100 
formula is not at all powdery and I
thought<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.390> pan<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.780> was<00:02:40.870> gonna<00:02:40.960> be<00:02:41.080> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
thought in the pan it was gonna be a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.980 
thought in the pan it was gonna be a
little<00:02:41.290> too<00:02:41.470> glittery<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:42.010> me<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.210> very

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.550 

kind<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.170> pink<00:02:47.950> coral<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.470> don't

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that it's got just enough shimmer and it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.860 
that it's got just enough shimmer and it
makes<00:03:00.160> me<00:03:00.280> Glow<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> little<00:03:00.940> bit<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.300> doesn't

overdone because I'm always wary about

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.750 
overdone because I'm always wary about
blushes<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.470> are<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.800> shimla<00:03:09.190> shimmery<00:03:09.640> they

would think of as nectar very peachy
coral<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.630> right<00:04:01.810> here<00:04:02.020> kind<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.320> a

coral and then this right here kind of a

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.170 
coral and then this right here kind of a
warmer<00:04:03.250> toned<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.930> at<00:04:05.110> all<00:04:05.260> metallic<00:04:06.060> out<00:04:07.060> of

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
warmer toned not at all metallic out of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.040 
warmer toned not at all metallic out of
peach<00:04:07.420> undertone<00:04:08.430> gold<00:04:09.430> very<00:04:09.880> soft<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.570> so

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
peach undertone gold very soft and so

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.120 
peach undertone gold very soft and so
they<00:04:11.140> tell<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.530> put<00:04:11.740> that<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.970> up<00:04:13.000> here

the<00:04:15.130> highlight<00:04:15.520> on<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.880> top<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.180> your

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
the highlight on the top of your

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.030 
the highlight on the top of your
cheekbones<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.350> actually<00:04:17.500> less

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
cheekbones and this is actually less

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.310 
cheekbones and this is actually less
shimmery<00:04:18.700> than<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.390> blush<00:04:19.600> it's<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.140> very

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
shimmery than the blush it's just a very

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.120 
shimmery than the blush it's just a very
soft<00:04:20.680> Sheen<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.700> also<00:04:21.910> put<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.120> here<00:04:22.510> um<00:04:23.130> so

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
soft Sheen and also put it here um so

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
soft Sheen and also put it here um so
overall<00:04:25.440> I'm<00:04:26.440> thrilled<00:04:27.040> with<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.310> blush

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
overall I'm thrilled with this blush

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.060 
overall I'm thrilled with this blush
first<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.750> all<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:28.900> think<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.560> coral

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
first of all I think the coral

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070 
first of all I think the coral
is<00:04:30.400> more<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.940> peach<00:04:31.120> coral<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:31.630> more<00:04:31.810> wearable

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
is more the peach coral is more wearable

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.770 
is more the peach coral is more wearable
than<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.530> lot<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.890> other<00:04:33.070> orange<00:04:33.910> undertones<00:04:34.480> in

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
than a lot of other orange undertones in

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.250 
than a lot of other orange undertones in
my<00:04:35.290> opinion<00:04:36.120> guess<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.270> think<00:04:37.480> my<00:04:37.750> opinions<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
my opinion guess I think my opinions the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.860 
my opinion guess I think my opinions the
same<00:04:38.410> thing<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.120> next<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.240> all<00:04:40.300> i<00:04:40.360> really<00:04:40.600> i

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
same thing and next of all i really i

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.210 
same thing and next of all i really i
thought<00:04:41.170> this<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:41.560> going<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.740> be<00:04:41.860> too<00:04:42.010> shimmery

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
thought this is going to be too shimmery

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.460 
thought this is going to be too shimmery

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
just really a subtle highlight that

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.530 
just really a subtle highlight that
makes<00:05:03.490> me<00:05:03.670> Glow<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.850> little<00:05:04.120> bit<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.360> then<00:05:04.510> I

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
makes me Glow a little bit and then I

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.430 
makes me Glow a little bit and then I
also<00:05:04.630> like<00:05:05.170> how<00:05:05.380> Matt<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.040> light<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:07.440> neutral

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
also like how Matt and light and neutral

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.280 
also like how Matt and light and neutral
tones<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:09.370> highlight<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.030> contour<00:05:10.420> is<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.080> if

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
tones the highlight the contour is so if

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.750 
tones the highlight the contour is so if
you<00:05:11.380> see<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.890> really<00:05:12.070> not<00:05:12.250> see<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.640> on<00:05:12.730> my
