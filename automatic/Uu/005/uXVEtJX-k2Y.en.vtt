00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
stay nine hundred off the fence now you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.299 
stay nine hundred off the fence now you
want<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> check<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.530> council<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> see

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
what their rules up then it's just a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.229 
what their rules up then it's just a
matter<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> lifting<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> grass

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.569 

then<00:00:44.230> we<00:00:44.410> go<00:00:44.530> do<00:00:44.680> these<00:00:44.739> try<00:00:44.950> down<00:00:45.160> some<00:00:45.340> piping

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
then we go do these try down some piping

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.160 
then we go do these try down some piping
sand<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.149> sprays<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:46.540> off

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.960 

we're<00:00:52.170> using<00:00:52.410> pavers<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.400> base<00:00:53.580> now

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
we're using pavers as the base now

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.700 
we're using pavers as the base now
beauty<00:00:54.630> that<00:00:54.810> is<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.470> get<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
beauty that is that you can get this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.140 
beauty that is that you can get this
done<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> working<00:00:56.400> so<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> wait<00:00:57.000> for

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
done the working so you have to wait for

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.230 
done the working so you have to wait for
a<00:00:57.210> concrete<00:00:57.480> slab<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.990> dry<00:00:58.940> rather<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
a concrete slab to dry rather than have

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.640 
a concrete slab to dry rather than have
to<00:01:00.270> set<00:01:00.540> up<00:01:00.570> string<00:01:00.900> lines<00:01:01.110> all<00:01:01.320> I've<00:01:01.440> done<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
to set up string lines all I've done is

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.620 
to set up string lines all I've done is
drop<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> strategy<00:01:02.580> down<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> sand<00:01:03.240> measures

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
drop the strategy down the sand measures

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
drop the strategy down the sand measures
off<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.840> fence<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.380> rest<00:01:04.559> just

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
off the fence and the rest just

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
off the fence and the rest just
follow-on<00:01:07.700> I'm<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.910> support<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> weight

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
follow-on I'm gonna support the weight

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
follow-on I'm gonna support the weight
of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> shed<00:01:10.050> with<00:01:10.650> Stuart<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.100> they're<00:01:11.220> gonna

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of the shed with Stuart so they're gonna

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
of the shed with Stuart so they're gonna
be<00:01:11.490> sitting<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.910> in<00:01:12.180> concrete<00:01:12.570> footings<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
be sitting down in concrete footings but

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
be sitting down in concrete footings but
so<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.710> stirrups<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.970> within<00:01:15.660> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so that these stirrups can be within the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.750 
so that these stirrups can be within the
paved<00:01:16.080> area<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.979> need<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.280> cut<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
paved area just need to cut off the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.060 
paved area just need to cut off the
corners<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> few<00:01:18.390> pavers<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.440> old<00:01:19.710> hand

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
corners of a few pavers with an old hand

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.469 
corners of a few pavers with an old hand
so<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.580> nothing<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:20.940> that's<00:01:21.150> cuz

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so there is nothing to do that's cuz

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.569 
so there is nothing to do that's cuz
these<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.020> lot<00:01:22.260> like

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.490 

take<00:01:29.210> your<00:01:29.329> few<00:01:29.479> holes<00:01:29.720> filling<00:01:30.320> with

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
take your few holes filling with

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.109 
take your few holes filling with
concrete<00:01:30.829> then<00:01:31.159> sticking<00:01:31.520> your<00:01:31.790> stirrups

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
concrete then sticking your stirrups

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.700 
concrete then sticking your stirrups
make<00:01:32.329> sure<00:01:32.540> they're<00:01:32.750> level<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.259> then<00:01:33.380> launch

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
make sure they're level and then launch

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.530 
make sure they're level and then launch
around<00:01:34.070> your<00:01:34.250> paved<00:01:34.460> area<00:01:34.909> with<00:01:35.090> some<00:01:35.270> sand

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540

cement that's going to make sure that in

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.469 
cement that's going to make sure that in
the<00:01:37.130> next<00:01:37.340> storm<00:01:37.610> you're<00:01:37.909> failing<00:01:38.090> sin

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
the next storm you're failing sin

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.149 
the next storm you're failing sin
doesn't<00:01:38.720> wash<00:01:38.930> away<00:01:41.320> wherever<00:01:42.320> possible<00:01:42.680> I'm

doesn't wash away wherever possible I'm

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.639 
doesn't wash away wherever possible I'm
using<00:01:43.460> recycled<00:01:44.090> material<00:01:44.780> for<00:01:44.899> this<00:01:45.020> job<00:01:45.259> and

this timber here recycle timbi are less

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.990 
this timber here recycle timbi are less
than<00:01:47.810> $1<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.259> meter<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.740> didn't<00:01:49.220> cut<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.580> up<00:01:49.729> in

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
than $1 a meter I didn't cut it up in

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
than $1 a meter I didn't cut it up in
the<00:01:50.210> length<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.689> can<00:01:50.960> make<00:01:51.140> up<00:01:51.320> my<00:01:51.350> timber

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the length so I can make up my timber
