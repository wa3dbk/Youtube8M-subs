00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.370 
teams well I think the first games the
most<00:01:07.119> important<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.630> them<00:01:07.780> you're<00:01:08.049> paying<00:01:08.290> a

most important to them you're paying a

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.480 
most important to them you're paying a
stinking<00:01:08.680> test<00:01:08.860> first<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.220> that's<00:01:09.340> one<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
stinking test first and that's one of

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.249 
stinking test first and that's one of
the<00:01:09.640> two<00:01:09.820> better<00:01:10.150> teams<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.630> figma<00:01:10.930> gym<00:01:11.080> and
