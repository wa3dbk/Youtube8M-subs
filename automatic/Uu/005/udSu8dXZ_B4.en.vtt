getting off topic today myself have come

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.390 
getting off topic today myself have come
up<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.300> many<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.140> possible<00:00:25.769> features<00:00:26.099> for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
up with many new possible features for

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
up with many new possible features for
future<00:00:26.760> reference<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.390> includes<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
future reference that includes the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
future reference that includes the
coding<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:29.369> previous<00:00:29.580> videos<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
coding from my previous videos the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
coding from my previous videos the
return<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.050> thundergun<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> moon<00:00:31.859> map<00:00:32.099> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
return of the thundergun and moon map I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.389 
return of the thundergun and moon map I
actually<00:00:32.820> analyze<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> code<00:00:34.079> heavily<00:00:34.680> some

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
actually analyze the code heavily some

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.889 
actually analyze the code heavily some
of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> actions<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.120> found<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.600> codes

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
of the actions that I found in the codes

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
of the actions that I found in the codes
are<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.320> extremely<00:00:37.760> breathtaking<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.940> let's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
are just extremely breathtaking so let's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
are just extremely breathtaking so let's
take<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:40.410> screenshot<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
take a look in this first screenshot you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.150 
take a look in this first screenshot you
can<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.719> says

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
can see right here that it says

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
can see right here that it says
onslaught<00:00:44.160> survived<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.059> signifies<00:00:45.719> some

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
onslaught survived this signifies some

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080 
onslaught survived this signifies some
sort<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> game<00:00:47.039> mode<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
sort of game mode where you have to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
sort of game mode where you have to
survive<00:00:48.390> waves<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.170> rounds<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> may<00:00:49.950> be

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
survive waves or rounds it may be

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
survive waves or rounds it may be
similar<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> left<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.329> dead<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.840> sure

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
similar to left for dead I'm not sure

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.020 
similar to left for dead I'm not sure
this<00:00:52.649> may<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.100> something<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this may have something to do with the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
this may have something to do with the
new<00:00:54.149> meat<00:00:54.449> game-mode<00:00:54.899> scheduled<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.710> soon

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
new meat game-mode scheduled for soon

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
new meat game-mode scheduled for soon
release<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> said<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.420> previous

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
release but like I said in my previous

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
release but like I said in my previous
video<00:00:58.050> none<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.010> 100-percent

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
video none of this is 100-percent

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
video none of this is 100-percent
confirmed<00:01:00.239> let's<00:01:01.140> further<00:01:01.410> analyze<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
confirmed let's further analyze the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310 
confirmed let's further analyze the
coding<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.660> says

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
coding as you can see here says

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
coding as you can see here says
transporter<00:01:05.189> activated<00:01:05.820> followed<00:01:06.150> by<00:01:06.270> the

transporter activated followed by the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
transporter activated followed by the
zipline<00:01:06.930> need<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> activated<00:01:07.890> by<00:01:08.070> use

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
zipline need to be activated by use

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
zipline need to be activated by use
could<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.510> new<00:01:09.990> form<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
could this be some new form of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
could this be some new form of
transportation<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.729> further<00:01:11.970> into

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
transportation well look further into

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.550 
transportation well look further into
the<00:01:12.420> cotan<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> found

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the cotan as you can see I found

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
the cotan as you can see I found
evidence<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> lunar<00:01:14.760> lander<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.720> as

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
evidence of the lunar lander as well as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
evidence of the lunar lander as well as
some<00:01:16.110> sort<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> chainsaw<00:01:17.100> mayhem<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
some sort of chainsaw mayhem this is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
some sort of chainsaw mayhem this is
honestly<00:01:18.630> killing<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.439> about<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
honestly killing me to think about I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.060 
honestly killing me to think about I
have<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.759> thing<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.390> found<00:01:21.799> may<00:01:22.799> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
have one more thing I found may have

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
have one more thing I found may have
some<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.580> significance<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
some more significance right here it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.760 
some more significance right here it

says to activate to cut open force open
or<00:01:29.130> hack<00:01:29.460> could<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> speed<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> return<00:01:31.470> the

was transit just some shit map just to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
was transit just some shit map just to
make<00:01:41.100> us<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.299> game<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
make us all think of the game as a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
make us all think of the game as a
morally<00:01:43.110> corrupt<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.369> treyarch

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
morally corrupt when it really treyarch

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300 
morally corrupt when it really treyarch
was<00:01:45.689> hard<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.140> work<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> guess

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
was hard at work this whole time I guess

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.560 
was hard at work this whole time I guess
we'll<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> find<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
we'll just have to find out as a
