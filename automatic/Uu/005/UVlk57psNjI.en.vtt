00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello friends how are you today study 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.970
 69 and we're in a good new video today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 I come to talk about an example of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.780
 overcoming an amazing person a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 pretty good person who is jolt bonus 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 27 as I see the title because it 's all 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.750
 an example of overcoming because jolin 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.060
 very good for people who do not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.300
 You know, I had youtube 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.609
 try good of minecraft mother of 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 minecraft trustees what is remembered 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.590
 I also think that you upload some video of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.510
 soccer sport 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.490
 what happens to this youtuber, he has 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.770
 a problem no one else was born with the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.300
 disease donation as the typical thing that 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.910
 born is that you run out of a bit of 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.040
 oxygen or other ignacio a little bad 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 then the problem what prevents it is 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.660
 speak correctly can speak but 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.449
 can not speak correctly and move 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 hands do not walk well at all or be 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.140
 you can go but maybe a little 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.390
 limping can not move very well 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.750
 good hands but that's the least the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.910
 reason is that it is a crack 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 play call of duty first he had a 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.100
 first channel that was called holy monkey 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.020
 27 and in that channel because it will be very fought 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.550
 the truth this kid came out and not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.010
 critiqueis space made famous for that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.260
 because it came out because black when knowing his 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.500
 story felt that you had to climb 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.979
 a video talking about him and well it is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 a kid an incredible recovery what 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.580
 that I said have a channel that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 they had a lot 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.960
 dislike if people insulted him 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.149
 I called delayed and I want to stay 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.910
 but you are a person or insulting 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.530
 an uncle that because of it and they insulted him and 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.270
 It has now created a new channel ago 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 a few months and the truth is that it is very 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 well things have changed all their 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.289
 haters so to speak almost all have gone 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.390
 now he already has many likes exceeding 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.460
 likes more than dislike before 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.500
 I had a lot more this is like these 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.350
 likes what likes and good for example 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.850
 game a modern warfare 3 I played but I 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 it cost a lot because he could not catch 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 okay the good command a lot of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 problems had and and well it is a 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.710
 example of overcoming now is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.959
 going up more minecraft and another kind of 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.459
 games because normal was a little 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.140
 bad in modern warfare 3 since not 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 I could move you imagine it's like 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.980

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.940
