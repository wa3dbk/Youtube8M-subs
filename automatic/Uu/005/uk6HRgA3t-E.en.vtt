the<00:00:40.230> important<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.980> we're

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the important thing is what we're

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.299 
the important thing is what we're
actually<00:00:41.399> doing<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:44.280> are

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually doing with this is we are

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.830 
actually doing with this is we are
converting

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
converting

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.060

this<00:00:46.200> depth<00:00:46.950> data<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.330> a<00:00:48.660> video<00:00:48.960> demo<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.920> two

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this depth data and a video demo in two

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
this depth data and a video demo in two
expressions<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.940> I'll<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.720> pull<00:00:52.110> up

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
expressions so I'll actually pull up

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.690 
expressions so I'll actually pull up
those<00:00:52.380> expressions<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
those expressions right now so the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.880 
those expressions right now so the
little<00:00:59.940> bars<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.900> see<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> bottom<00:01:01.710> right

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
little bars you see in the bottom right

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.380 
little bars you see in the bottom right
hand<00:01:01.920> corner<00:01:02.220> are<00:01:02.730> each<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.250> expressions

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
hand corner are each of our expressions

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.290 
hand corner are each of our expressions
and<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.900> bottom<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.729> zero<00:01:08.729> value<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.569 

smile<00:01:15.410> you'll<00:01:16.410> see<00:01:16.619> those<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:17.010> bars

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.889 

smile<00:01:21.860> shapes<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.090> raise<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.479> eyebrows

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
smile shapes if I raise my eyebrows

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.380 
smile shapes if I raise my eyebrows
you'll<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.670> left<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.060> eyebrow

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you'll see the left and right eyebrow

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200 
you'll see the left and right eyebrow
shape<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.770> instance<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:29.850> streaming

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
shape for instance so we're streaming

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
shape for instance so we're streaming
this<00:01:30.509> stuff<00:01:30.750> online<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.460> low

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
this stuff online this is a really low

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
this stuff online this is a really low
latency<00:01:34.670> small<00:01:35.670> amount<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.570> data<00:01:36.750> or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
latency small amount of data or

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.219 
latency small amount of data or
intensity<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.149> certainly<00:01:40.049> not

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
intensity so it's not certainly not

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.600 
intensity so it's not certainly not
compressed<00:01:40.619> video<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.280> even

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
compressed video it's not even

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.510 
compressed video it's not even
compressed<00:01:41.970> audio<00:01:42.200> we're<00:01:43.200> talking<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
compressed audio we're talking about so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.919 
compressed audio we're talking about so
you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> imagine<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
you can imagine what you could do in a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.929 
you can imagine what you could do in a
situation
