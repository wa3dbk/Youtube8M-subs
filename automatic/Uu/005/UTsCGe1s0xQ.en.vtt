I<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.319> here<00:02:18.319> does<00:02:18.709> have<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.129> photo<00:02:19.400> sounds

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I have here does have the photo sounds

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.610 
I have here does have the photo sounds
as<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.239> hear<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.629> they<00:02:20.780> were<00:02:20.840> available<00:02:21.170> proto

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
as you hear if they were available proto

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.339 
as you hear if they were available proto
sounds<00:02:22.129> or<00:02:22.370> traditional<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.110> proto

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
sounds or traditional I like the proto

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.130 
sounds or traditional I like the proto
sounds<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:26.060> you're<00:02:26.269> with<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> proto

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
sounds and if you're with the proto

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.839 
sounds and if you're with the proto
sounds<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:27.560> you're<00:02:27.769> having<00:02:28.459> one<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> those

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
sounds if you're having one of those

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.150 
sounds if you're having one of those
days<00:02:29.120> where<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:30.319> like<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.560> way<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.860> was<00:02:30.890> in

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
days where you like the way it was in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.710 
days where you like the way it was in
the<00:02:31.190> 20s<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.730> 30s<00:02:31.849> when<00:02:32.269> they<00:02:32.420> didn't<00:02:32.690> have

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the 20s and 30s when they didn't have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.110 
the 20s and 30s when they didn't have
sound<00:02:33.160> there's<00:02:34.160> an<00:02:34.340> adjustment<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
sound there's an adjustment on the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.270 
sound there's an adjustment on the
bottom<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.569> this<00:02:36.140> locomotive<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.920> can<00:02:37.099> turn

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
bottom of this locomotive you can turn

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.550 
bottom of this locomotive you can turn
the<00:02:37.489> sounds<00:02:37.879> off<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.379> having

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the sounds off so it's just like having

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.589 
the sounds off so it's just like having
a<00:02:39.769> traditional<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.849> you<00:02:40.940> get<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.269> best<00:02:41.420> of

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
a traditional so you get the best of

a traditional so you get the best of
both<00:02:41.750> worlds<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.290> one<00:02:42.440> engine<00:02:42.829> with<00:02:43.040> the

pulling into a station you have the belt

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.080 
pulling into a station you have the belt
you<00:03:24.410> can<00:03:24.560> turn<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.430> off<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:26.000> a

you can turn this on and off just a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.789 
you can turn this on and off just a

button on the transformer whenever you
want<00:03:42.430> put<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:44.320> horn<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.650> these<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.550> do<00:03:45.700> get

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
want put on the horn on these you do get

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.210 
want put on the horn on these you do get
some<00:03:46.030> extra<00:03:46.180> sounds<00:03:46.960> with<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.230> if<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:47.980> hold

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
some extra sounds with it if you hold

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.160 
some extra sounds with it if you hold
the<00:03:48.340> horn<00:03:48.580> longer<00:03:49.060> for<00:03:50.020> example

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.590 

that's<00:03:56.740> approximately<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.580> five-second<00:03:58.420> horn

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
that's approximately a five-second horn

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.170 
that's approximately a five-second horn
on<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.840> horn<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.530> can<00:04:00.340> hear<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.670> water<00:04:00.880> pump

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
on the horn you can hear the water pump

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.210 
on the horn you can hear the water pump
going<00:04:01.510> off<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.840> background<00:04:01.930> right<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:02.650> as

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
going off in the background right now as

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.470 
going off in the background right now as
well<00:04:03.580> as<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.970> pre-talk<00:04:05.070> there's<00:04:06.480> there's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
well as the pre-talk there's there's

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.110 
well as the pre-talk there's there's
dozens<00:04:07.840> upon<00:04:08.140> dozens<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.980> crew<00:04:09.610> talks<00:04:09.910> and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
dozens upon dozens of crew talks and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.030 
dozens upon dozens of crew talks and
things<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.690> crew<00:04:10.930> says<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.500> they're<00:04:11.890> all

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
things the crew says and they're all

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.180 
things the crew says and they're all
random<00:04:12.340> flight<00:04:13.590> back<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:14.830> horn<00:04:15.040> though

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
random flight back to the horn though

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.920 
random flight back to the horn though
you<00:04:15.430> hear<00:04:15.640> if<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.120> hold<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.480> horn<00:04:16.690> button

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you hear if you hold the horn button

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.479 
you hear if you hold the horn button
longer<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.920> get<00:04:18.100> yet<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> different

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
longer you get yet a different

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:29.390 
longer you get yet a different
additional<00:04:19.450> sound

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.189 

so<00:04:30.400> again<00:04:30.639> there's<00:04:30.939> there's<00:04:31.419> lots<00:04:31.569> of<00:04:31.780> options

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
so again there's there's lots of options

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.230 
so again there's there's lots of options
and<00:04:32.409> these<00:04:32.919> are<00:04:33.159> great<00:04:33.340> trains<00:04:33.639> to<00:04:33.819> play<00:04:34.000> with

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
and these are great trains to play with

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.679 
and these are great trains to play with
there's<00:04:34.449> lots<00:04:34.689> of<00:04:34.840> buildin<00:04:35.199> play<00:04:35.470> value<00:04:36.689> on
