00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello, we're starting here one more 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 face motor show today in a climate of 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 kart racing circuit auto racing 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 a lot of emotion for you today in the program 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.190
 a car and has already launched chevrolet onyx 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.190
 on the screen for you 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.730
 the presentation definitely made 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.830
 Onyx soon starts to build the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.690
 its history and to mark this 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.660
 revolutionary we are accustomed to 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.770
 you have and see I think the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.770
 first to break paradigms 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.560
 It's going to be a car he's not even defining. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 also there is no trend in high places that are 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:01.000
 forts that are well covered in chopped 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.590
 street but follows the very dynamic and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.590
 sculptural time tour 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.470
 smelling inside contents appearance of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.380
 bus is also surprising in ensuring 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.680
 space functionality and much comfort 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.420
 we had to find a new way 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.110
 to dispense with the identity of the chevrolet 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.780
 interior 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.540
 now is it that wanting is good power for the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.580
 luis a samaria dani so after all they 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.440
 They did not lose time until one of the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.540
 cars chevrolet carlos cury already 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.119
 guarantee its onyx and the reasons 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.909
 that compares samaria dani they do not deny 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.550
 was the same modern look and bold 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.740
 already for Luis certainly the attendance of the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.479
 concessionaire carlos cunha was decisive 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.009
 also looking for competition 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.570
 I saw if I passed in front of 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.880
 concessionaire for love at first sight 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 good everyone happy with their coach the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 that could be better than that clear 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.920
 participates in test with the pilot Carlos 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.160
 wedge 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.420
 let's explain our engineering 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:08.470
 he has the engine now of this generation sp 4 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.610
 which is the engine more advanced than the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 economic relationship franks 1.4 more with 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 next 1.8 power why it gives 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.910
 this feeling and you count guiding the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.260
 car gives impression that he is walking a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.530
 car with much more for 106 horses 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.140
 4.800 legal handle a touch goes to 6 and 6 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.239
 thousand he arrives in the top of the 106 horses but 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.530
 the footprint is very strong the touch is very 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:39.130
 good this generation sp4 that gm released is the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.380
 generation that comes from global gm is the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.630
 car that will make success will write 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.110
 Brazil and the world and the car made in

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.109
