00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
listen to the kind of dynamics possible

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.470 
listen to the kind of dynamics possible
from<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.040> new<00:03:15.310> amp<00:03:15.520> modeling<00:03:15.880> technology

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
from this new amp modeling technology

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.820 
from this new amp modeling technology
it's<00:03:16.630> very<00:03:16.840> expressive<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:17.620> playing

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's very expressive just like playing

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.980 
it's very expressive just like playing
through<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> real<00:03:18.340> tube<00:03:19.300> amplifier<00:03:19.810> or

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
through a real tube amplifier or

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.040 
through a real tube amplifier or
something<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:20.920> here<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.940> go

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
something so here we go

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:35.220 
something so here we go
