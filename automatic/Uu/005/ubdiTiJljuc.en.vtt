hi my name is Jana from audio 46 today
I'll<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.090> talking<00:00:09.269> about<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> Sennheiser

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.849 
momentum to on ear wired headphones I
have<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> ivory<00:00:15.480> model<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.199> me<00:00:16.379> today<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
have the ivory model with me today and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.800 
have the ivory model with me today and
I'll<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.100> discussing<00:00:17.880> what<00:00:18.420> makes<00:00:18.630> it

with<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.409> cables<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> could<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
on ears is that they fold utilizing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
on ears is that they fold utilizing

lightweight stainless steel sliders and
thus<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> smaller<00:01:28.500> footprint<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.280> goes

you<00:03:40.810> can<00:03:40.990> see<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> difference<00:03:41.650> here<00:03:41.920> I've

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
you can see the difference here I've

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.250 
you can see the difference here I've
placed<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.060> em1<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.600> em2

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.560 
headphones on a moveable wooden door
just<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> demonstrate<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:49.090> difference<00:03:49.420> in

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
just to demonstrate the difference in

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.120 
just to demonstrate the difference in
headbands<00:03:50.110> they're<00:03:50.350> both<00:03:50.530> placed<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.119 

now<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.659> going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.959> compare<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.560> headbands

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
now I'm going to compare the headbands

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.830 
now I'm going to compare the headbands
of<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.489> original<00:03:58.970> momentum<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.690> the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
of the original momentum and the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.839 
of the original momentum and the
momentum<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.799> your<00:04:01.069> headphones<00:04:01.280> by

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
momentum to on your headphones by

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.970 
momentum to on your headphones by
showing<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.510> how<00:04:02.629> they<00:04:02.750> look<00:04:02.989> on<00:04:03.140> my<00:04:03.379> head<00:04:03.680> as

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
showing you how they look on my head as

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.800 
showing you how they look on my head as
you<00:04:06.980> can<00:04:07.129> see<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.549> Alcantara<00:04:08.120> padding<00:04:08.569> does

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
you can see the Alcantara padding does

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.360 
you can see the Alcantara padding does
come<00:04:09.080> down<00:04:09.260> further<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.010> headband

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
come down further on the headband

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.640 
come down further on the headband
however<00:04:11.120> due<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.659> shape<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.080> size<00:04:12.349> of<00:04:12.500> my

difference<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:15.049> think<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.830> this<00:04:16.070> improvement

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
difference I think that this improvement

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.400 
difference I think that this improvement
will<00:04:16.699> mainly<00:04:16.940> benefit<00:04:17.479> people<00:04:17.900> with<00:04:18.049> larger

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
a huge fan of on ear headphones because

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.960 
a huge fan of on ear headphones because
I<00:04:26.740> don't<00:04:26.950> find<00:04:27.160> they're<00:04:27.340> slightly<00:04:27.580> smaller

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
I don't find they're slightly smaller

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.730 
I don't find they're slightly smaller
size<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.600> make<00:04:28.750> an<00:04:28.900> immense<00:04:29.170> difference<00:04:29.560> and

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740
