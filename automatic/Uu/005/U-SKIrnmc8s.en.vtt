to be fair they're just getting used to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.700 
to be fair they're just getting used to
each<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.270> sort<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
each other they just sort of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.899

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
know the one where they're still trying

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.979 
know the one where they're still trying
to<00:03:25.579> figure<00:03:25.820> things<00:03:26.090> out<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.390> they<00:03:26.630> kind<00:03:26.900> of

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
to figure things out and they kind of

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.590

play<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.680> safe<00:03:27.980> for<00:03:28.519> their<00:03:28.670> first<00:03:28.910> thing<00:03:29.209> and

play it safe for their first thing and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.819 
play it safe for their first thing and
it's<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.900> pretty<00:03:30.290> standard<00:03:31.220> premise<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:32.799> so<00:03:33.799> I

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
it's a pretty standard premise and so I

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.039

can only assume that later volumes of
the<00:03:36.110> manga<00:03:36.500> are<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.860> pick<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.400> it
