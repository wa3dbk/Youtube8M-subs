00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 ninth of the dijon ranking has always 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920
 some league climbing ambitions 1 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 because there are only five points of difference 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.450
 with the podium 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 on his side arles avignon is 12th but 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.050
 there only five points forward on the zone 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.520
 of relegation 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 three places of difference but two ambitions 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.010
 very different between these two 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 training 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.830
 dijon will have to evolve without a suspended fee 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.790
 Bella and Remy are injured for the team 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.680
 from franck dumas 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.190
 rodriguez is suspended these are ben 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.049
 Saada and GaÃ«l givet who are injured 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.659
 dijon plays in red at home of course 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.040
 arles avignon in blue and these are the 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.150
 visitors first to put themselves in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 action with this free kick 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.430
 it's on the crossbar 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 bounces close to the line and the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.290
 goaltender of dijon benjamin lecomte 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.869
 is doing very well 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.890
 the Burgundian answer with this balloon 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:04.460
 poorly cleared the surrender in the surface and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 this point- blank shot was saved 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 with the exploit of butelle ludovic and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.300
 seemed to be deceiving at first and also to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 catch up 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.660
 a balanced match much more balanced 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.980
 than expected with this team of arles 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.550
 avignon who plays well blow to 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.310
 outdoors 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.880
 the center and this recovery that goes on to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 close to the goal post kept by the count 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 a team of arles avignon who stays on 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.980
 eight games without a win 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 why they got closer to the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.170
 Red zone 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.270
 they took only two points on the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.440
 last six games and got into 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.120
 the good arrangements to get 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.430
 something to dijon even though the 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.810
 Dijon also gets some 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 opportunities and are the most realistic at 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 best moment 42nd minute to 3 minutes 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 of the half time it is johan gastian who 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 open the scoring and this is his fifth 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:59.900
 goal of the season at half time dijon 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.900
 even on the score of 1 0 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 and arles avignon was trapped a 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.760
 dijon team which she too is in 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 difficulty lately on two 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.530
 consecutive defeats over five matches 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.780
 without a win in this series of matches 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 without success there were only two points 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.740
 taken it is too little to hope to play 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.740
 holiday troubles at the end of the season 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.640
 people who wants to quickly put the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.270
 second goal to be quiet in 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.590
 the encounter 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.680
 why not on this recovery of the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 head of julio tavares but it goes to 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.650
 above the brooms that do not arrive at 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.760
 kill the match arles avignon has always 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.650
 a chance 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.230
 watch out for this ball out of the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.710
 surface the victorious recovery of julien 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.780
 cardy 92nd minute in stoppage time 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.310
 it's the disaster for dijon first 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.140
 goal of the season for cardy who has 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.890
 applied to place the ball at 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 best places 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.300
 benjamin lecomte is beaten and arles 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.010
 avignon almost did believe it until 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.260
 bout because the players of franck dumas 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.940
 just got the point of the draw at 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.940
 dijon final score a goal everywhere
