00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the original one with it not activated

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
the original one with it not activated
and<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> zoom<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.810> scroll

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and I'm just going to zoom in and scroll

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
and I'm just going to zoom in and scroll

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
around so you guys can see right there
and<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.469> here<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.609> one<00:01:41.819> with<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and then here is the one with it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
and then here is the one with it
activated<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.889> can<00:01:44.069> tell<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.609> more<00:01:44.880> high

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
activated as you can tell it's more high

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.289 
activated as you can tell it's more high
quality<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.159> looks<00:01:47.369> better<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
quality and it just looks better and it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.809 
quality and it just looks better and it
makes<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> experience<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:50.009> better<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
makes the experience a lot better if you

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.179 
makes the experience a lot better if you
have<00:01:51.060> Retina<00:01:51.749> pad<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.649> eye

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
have Retina pad on your eye

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.880 
have Retina pad on your eye
so<00:01:53.969> now<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.749> doesn't<00:01:54.990> work<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.409> every

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so now this doesn't work for every

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.919 
so now this doesn't work for every
single<00:01:56.159> iPhone<00:01:56.460> applications<00:01:57.390> only<00:01:57.569> the

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
single iPhone applications only the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.050 
single iPhone applications only the
iPhone<00:01:58.289> applications<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.369> optimized

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
iPhone applications that are optimized

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.080 
iPhone applications that are optimized
