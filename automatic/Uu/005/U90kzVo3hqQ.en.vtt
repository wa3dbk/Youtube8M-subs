00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.320
 hello to all youtube visitors first 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.840
 Once our greeting is the brass band 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.120
 burgundy with her oliver tips 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.340
 meyer this us this thing here 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.740
 but still have many 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.240
 thanks for your nomination 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.039
 we have been looking forward to it for years 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.690
 shared barbecue and cool drinks 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.240
 together with the musicians of the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.800
 blasorchester and burlo though 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.409
 due to our decency their 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.120
 invitation not to grab because 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:38.649
 Of course you are the older chapel 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.909
 and so we wait first 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.600
 probably even further on yours 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.069
 invitation until Tuesday afternoon 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 honestly, nothing about the 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.899
 known cold water challenge 2014 and 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.589
 thus not easy for us 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.239
 just to find a suitable post 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.010
 since we are just before our summer concert 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.679
 we can not stand either 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.559
 Failure of a musician to afford himself 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.729
 maybe even caught a cold and then with 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.729
 a flu must lie in bed 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.490
 therefore we do it a little differently 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.060
 we connect the duty with the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.610
 useful make a little trip 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 in the guests recreation area around in the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 local healing spring with a cold water 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.830
 application to draw new strength 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.830
 Just let yourself be surprised 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.680
 so strengthened again we devote ourselves 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.710

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.090
