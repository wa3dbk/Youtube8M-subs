have<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.320> made<00:00:25.560> already<00:00:25.789> was<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> failure

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have been made already was it a failure

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
have been made already was it a failure
of<00:00:27.449> superman<00:00:28.050> returns<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.740> no<00:00:29.010> plans<00:00:29.490> were

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
of superman returns that no plans were

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.319 
of superman returns that no plans were
made<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.510> quickly<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.199> crossover<00:00:31.590> film<00:00:31.949> or

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
made so quickly for crossover film or

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
made so quickly for crossover film or
even<00:00:33.329> other<00:00:33.510> standalone<00:00:34.200> DC<00:00:34.649> films<00:00:35.040> like

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
even other standalone DC films like

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.030 
even other standalone DC films like
Wonder<00:00:35.610> Woman<00:00:35.780> flash<00:00:36.780> green<00:00:37.440> arrow<00:00:37.739> or

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
Wonder Woman flash green arrow or

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.119 
Wonder Woman flash green arrow or
Aquaman<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.170> think<00:00:40.170> there's<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:41.010> two

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
Aquaman I think there's actually two

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
Aquaman I think there's actually two
parts<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.489> question<00:00:41.850> number<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
parts that question number one do we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
parts that question number one do we
think<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.950> financial<00:00:44.160> failure<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
think that the financial failure of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
think that the financial failure of
Superman<00:00:45.390> Returns<00:00:45.890> hindered<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Superman Returns hindered the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.950 
Superman Returns hindered the
progression<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.969> DC<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.450> able<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> do

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
progression of what DC was able to do

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
progression of what DC was able to do
and<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.500> second<00:00:49.770> question<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and the second question is if it was a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.380 
and the second question is if it was a
huge<00:00:50.940> success<00:00:51.230> or<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.800> also<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> failure<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
huge success or was also the failure the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.049 
huge success or was also the failure the
reason<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> spin-offs<00:00:55.440> I

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
reason we don't see the spin-offs I

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.439 
reason we don't see the spin-offs I
think<00:00:57.059> number<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:58.039> yes<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.730> financial

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
think number one yes the financial

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
think number one yes the financial
failure<00:01:00.960> although<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> hard<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.710> call<00:01:01.859> any

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
failure although it's hard to call any

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.170 
failure although it's hard to call any
movie<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.460> makes<00:01:02.670> over<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.059> hundred

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
movie that makes over two hundred

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.660 
movie that makes over two hundred
million<00:01:03.480> dollars<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.019> financial<00:01:04.589> failure<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
million dollars a financial failure so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.980 
million dollars a financial failure so
we'll<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> matter<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
we'll just say that's a matter of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
we'll just say that's a matter of
perspective<00:01:07.200> okay<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> didn't<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.820> as

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
perspective okay but it didn't do as

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
perspective okay but it didn't do as
well<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.450> were<00:01:09.570> hoping<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> fact

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
well as they were hoping so is the fact

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
well as they were hoping so is the fact
that<00:01:11.400> superman<00:01:11.850> returns<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.780> Brandon<00:01:13.110> Ralph

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that superman returns with Brandon Ralph

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.070 
that superman returns with Brandon Ralph
which<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.970> was<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.299> bad<00:01:15.540> comic

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
which by the way was a very bad comic

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
which by the way was a very bad comic
book<00:01:16.229> movie<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.070> thought<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.580> pretty<00:01:17.970> good

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
book movie but I thought a pretty good

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
book movie but I thought a pretty good
movie<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> people<00:01:20.700> get

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
movie and I know a lot of people get

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.100 
movie and I know a lot of people get
angry<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> say<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.840> actually

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
angry at me when I say that I actually

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
angry at me when I say that I actually
think<00:01:22.320> Superman<00:01:22.740> Returns<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> pretty<00:01:23.610> good

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
think Superman Returns was a pretty good

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
think Superman Returns was a pretty good
movie<00:01:24.240> although<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.540> admit<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> pretty<00:01:25.049> bad

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
movie although I admit it's a pretty bad

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
movie although I admit it's a pretty bad
comic<00:01:25.890> book<00:01:26.070> movie<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.330> whole

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
comic book movie but that's a whole

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.660 
comic book movie but that's a whole
discussion<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:28.049> another<00:01:28.110> day<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> had

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
discussion for another day but if it had

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
discussion for another day but if it had
been<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.150> successful<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.920> would

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
been more successful I think you would

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
been more successful I think you would
have<00:01:32.159> seen<00:01:33.380> Warner<00:01:34.380> Brothers<00:01:34.650> been<00:01:34.979> more

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
have seen Warner Brothers been more

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
have seen Warner Brothers been more
aggressive<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.170> developing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
aggressive if you will in developing

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
aggressive if you will in developing
their<00:01:38.340> DC<00:01:38.729> Universe<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.570> their

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
their DC Universe of all their

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
their DC Universe of all their
characters<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.979> done<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.220> Batman

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
characters would they have done a Batman

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.639 
characters would they have done a Batman
crossover<00:01:42.299> film<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> Christopher

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
crossover film with the Christopher

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
crossover film with the Christopher
Nolan<00:01:43.680> Batman<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.549> Christian<00:01:44.790> Bale<00:01:44.939> playing

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
Nolan Batman and Christian Bale playing

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
Nolan Batman and Christian Bale playing
the<00:01:45.360> role<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.189> think

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the role I don't think so I don't think

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
the role I don't think so I don't think
Christopher<00:01:48.210> Nolan<00:01:48.479> wanted<00:01:48.810> anything<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> do

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
Christopher Nolan wanted anything to do

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
Christopher Nolan wanted anything to do
with<00:01:49.470> crossovers<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.430> created<00:01:50.850> his

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
with crossovers I think he created his

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.899 
with crossovers I think he created his
batman<00:01:51.659> universe<00:01:51.829> very<00:01:52.829> isolated<00:01:53.579> from<00:01:53.700> what

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
batman universe very isolated from what

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
could be as broader DC universe I don't

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
think you would have seen aliens or

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.660 
think you would have seen aliens or
superpowers<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.710> anything<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
superpowers or anything like that in a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
superpowers or anything like that in a
in<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.090> Christopher<00:02:00.420> Nolan<00:02:00.719> universe<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.140> don't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
in a Christopher Nolan universe I don't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.450 
in a Christopher Nolan universe I don't
think<00:02:01.409> he<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.649> allowed<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
think he would have allowed it so I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.010 
think he would have allowed it so I
think<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.000> had<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.390> waited

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
think we would have had to have waited

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.899
