00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.469
 these people want all of Peru as it is 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.990
 after two weeks without fit because 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:13.840
 it went wrong and I took it to the guarantee and 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.099
 they said it was a mistake of had failures 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.830
 the hard drive 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.170
 of factory failure and whore gave me a 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.750
 new but after two weeks that 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.000
 they were checking us and everything already has a 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.689
 new so I do not have anything 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.330
 erased the entire library this because it does not 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.399
 saves on the external disk so that 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.850
