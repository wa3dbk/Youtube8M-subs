00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
new to me I never really got a chance to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.389 
new to me I never really got a chance to
use<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.629> much<00:02:04.929> up<00:02:05.319> until<00:02:05.739> my<00:02:05.830> final<00:02:06.160> year<00:02:06.369> of

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
use it much up until my final year of

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.859 
use it much up until my final year of
high<00:02:06.610> school<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.119> didn't<00:02:07.300> get<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.479> use<00:02:07.629> it<00:02:07.780> all

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
high school and didn't get to use it all

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.979 
high school and didn't get to use it all
in<00:02:07.929> college<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:09.970> use<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.450> I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
in college so I want to use it and I

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.770 
in college so I want to use it and I
feel<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.410> need<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.650> use<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:13.450> terms

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
feel like I need to use it but in terms

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.059 
feel like I need to use it but in terms
of<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.989> cutter<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.530> gonna<00:02:14.680> try<00:02:14.890> out<00:02:14.920> a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
of the cutter I'm gonna try out a

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.420 
of the cutter I'm gonna try out a
different<00:02:15.310> pitch<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> second<00:02:17.290> game<00:02:17.430> most

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
different pitch in the second game most

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.300 
different pitch in the second game most
likely<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.910> along<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> lines<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:21.040> seam

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
likely go along the lines of to seam

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.580 
likely go along the lines of to seam
because<00:02:21.519> I<00:02:21.879> feel<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.090> maybe<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.170> two<00:02:23.379> seam

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
because I feel like maybe a two seam

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.050 
because I feel like maybe a two seam
would<00:02:23.769> complement<00:02:24.430> my<00:02:24.580> other<00:02:24.760> pitches<00:02:24.940> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
would complement my other pitches a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
would complement my other pitches a
little<00:02:25.209> bit<00:02:25.300> better<00:02:25.420> than<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> cutter<00:02:25.950> breaking

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
little bit better than a cutter breaking

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.080 
little bit better than a cutter breaking
a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.160> bit<00:02:27.250> different<00:02:27.550> direction<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
a little bit different direction the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270 
a little bit different direction the
slider<00:02:28.390> good<00:02:29.050> against<00:02:29.590> right-handed<00:02:29.980> hitters

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
slider good against right-handed hitters

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.570 
slider good against right-handed hitters
so<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.530> probably<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.920> better<00:02:33.130> idea

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
so I think that's probably a better idea

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.340 
so I think that's probably a better idea
and<00:02:35.120> I'm<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.660> grateful<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:38.230> Andhra<00:02:39.230> has

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
and I'm really grateful that Andhra has

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.290 
and I'm really grateful that Andhra has
some<00:02:39.560> good<00:02:39.650> coaches<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.700> actually<00:02:41.030> got

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
some good coaches because I actually got

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.490 
some good coaches because I actually got
to<00:02:41.390> work<00:02:41.420> with<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.870> his<00:02:41.990> pitching<00:02:42.290> coaches

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
to work with one of his pitching coaches

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.440 
to work with one of his pitching coaches
from<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.860> Mariners<00:02:43.280> who<00:02:43.910> helped<00:02:44.060> me<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.270> my

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
from the Mariners who helped me with my

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.170 
from the Mariners who helped me with my
delivery<00:02:45.040> lowered<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.190> arm<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.610> angle<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
delivery lowered my arm to angle down a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.680 
delivery lowered my arm to angle down a
little<00:02:47.450> bit<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:48.140> deceptive<00:02:48.890> sign<00:02:49.220> wider

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
little bit that deceptive sign wider

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.470 
little bit that deceptive sign wider
side<00:02:50.690> winder<00:02:51.470> type<00:02:51.680> motion<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:53.000> helps<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
side winder type motion really helps to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.450 
side winder type motion really helps to
see<00:02:53.780> batter's<00:02:54.260> as<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:55.070> tell<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
see batter's as you can tell the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.860 
see batter's as you can tell the
strikeouts<00:02:56.030> are<00:02:56.120> already<00:02:56.300> coming<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.630> pretty

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
strikeouts are already coming in pretty

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.560 
strikeouts are already coming in pretty
quickly<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.920> think<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.060> pretty<00:02:59.300> good

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
quickly so I think it's a pretty good

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.740 
quickly so I think it's a pretty good
spot<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.350> in<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.800> just<00:03:01.220> need<00:03:01.460> this<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:02.630> need

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
spot to be in I just need this just need

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.850 
spot to be in I just need this just need
to<00:03:02.840> keep<00:03:02.960> water<00:03:03.110> out<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.260> my<00:03:03.350> curveball

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
to keep water out of my curveball

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.490 
to keep water out of my curveball
because<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.370> hangs<00:03:05.030> too<00:03:05.270> much<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.380> know<00:03:06.470> I

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
because it hangs too much you know I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.290 
because it hangs too much you know I
want<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.100> break<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.580> it's<00:03:07.610> not<00:03:07.790> breaking<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
want to break and it's not breaking the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.510 
want to break and it's not breaking the
right<00:03:08.450> way<00:03:08.630> sometimes<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.560> sometimes<00:03:10.400> it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
right way sometimes and sometimes it

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.700 
right way sometimes and sometimes it
just<00:03:10.550> goes<00:03:10.760> straight<00:03:11.030> into<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.240> dirt<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:12.050> and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
just goes straight into the dirt but and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.160 
just goes straight into the dirt but and
that<00:03:12.860> was<00:03:12.980> my<00:03:13.100> fastball<00:03:13.550> pitching<00:03:14.090> those<00:03:14.540> that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
that was my fastball pitching those that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.700 
that was my fastball pitching those that
was<00:03:15.290> some<00:03:15.440> pretty<00:03:15.560> good<00:03:19.840> overall<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.020> think<00:03:21.470> I'm

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
was some pretty good overall I think I'm

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.580 
was some pretty good overall I think I'm
taking<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.310> showcase<00:03:22.790> by<00:03:23.030> storm<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.780> mean
