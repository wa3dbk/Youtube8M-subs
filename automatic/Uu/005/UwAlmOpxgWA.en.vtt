of flexibility in the shoe which is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.279 
of flexibility in the shoe which is
great<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.670> running<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.960> see

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.459 
great for running and if you can see
right<00:00:55.610> there<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> run<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.960> most<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
right there that's what I run on most of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
right there that's what I run on most of
the<00:00:58.620> time<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.370> super<00:00:59.730> hot<00:00:59.940> outside

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the time because it's super hot outside

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
the time because it's super hot outside
I'm<00:01:00.660> sweating<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.559> storm<00:01:01.590> summers<00:01:02.250> really

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
I'm sweating up a storm summers really

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.390 
I'm sweating up a storm summers really
in<00:01:02.969> full<00:01:03.570> swing<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.379> excuse<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:04.979> sweatiness

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
but I guess that goes with the theme so

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.730 
but I guess that goes with the theme so
maybe<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.900> i'll<00:01:10.020> start<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.350> pants

body<00:01:46.200> faster<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
body faster so you don't get so

overheated<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.530> also<00:01:49.710> doesn't<00:01:50.159> give<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
overheated and it also doesn't give you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120 
overheated and it also doesn't give you
like<00:01:50.610> heat<00:01:50.909> rash<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:52.079> sweat<00:01:52.409> not

being<00:01:53.430> able<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> escape<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.110> causes<00:01:55.500> like

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
being able to escape so it causes like

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.690 
being able to escape so it causes like
zits<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.469> just<00:01:58.469> skin<00:01:58.979> irritation<00:01:59.579> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
to go around to freely because it can

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.770 
to go around to freely because it can

they could say so it's always good to

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.540

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
longer tank top like this so since it

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
this is perfect for just layering over

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.250 
this is perfect for just layering over
top<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:10.690> your<00:04:11.690> sports<00:04:12.290> bra<00:04:12.560> because<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:15.170> me

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
I don't want my stomach showing if i'm

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.860 
I don't want my stomach showing if i'm
going<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.120> gym<00:04:17.210> or<00:04:17.419> outside

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
going to the gym or outside

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.000 
going to the gym or outside
actually<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.139> I'm<00:04:19.229> running<00:04:19.470> around<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.799> don't

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
actually if I'm running around I don't

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.400 
actually if I'm running around I don't
want<00:04:20.130> anybody<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.699> see<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:21.570> jiggle<00:04:21.989> action

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
want anybody to see that jiggle action

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.080 
want anybody to see that jiggle action
so<00:04:22.650> this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.949> great<00:04:23.130> because<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.639> covers<00:04:23.820> up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
so this is great because it covers up

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000 
so this is great because it covers up
that<00:04:24.300> area<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:24.960> it's<00:04:25.110> still<00:04:25.350> leads<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.680> cool

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
that area but it's still leads you cool

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.159 
that area but it's still leads you cool
so<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.790> really<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.389> this<00:04:27.510> one<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.750> got<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.110> one

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.120 
thousand calorie workout so that's hit
high<00:05:29.729> intensity<00:05:30.389> interval<00:05:30.510> training<00:05:31.130> kardia

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
high intensity interval training kardia

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.270 
high intensity interval training kardia
like<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.669> cardio<00:05:33.560> cardio<00:05:34.560> warm<00:05:34.830> up<00:05:35.039> and<00:05:35.190> then

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
like the cardio cardio warm up and then

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.339 
like the cardio cardio warm up and then
it<00:05:35.520> has<00:05:35.669> ab<00:05:35.880> work<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.690> then<00:05:36.870> it<00:05:36.960> also<00:05:37.110> has

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
it has ab work and then it also has

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.600 
it has ab work and then it also has
strength<00:05:37.620> training<00:05:37.889> so<00:05:38.130> i<00:05:38.160> think<00:05:38.280> that's

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
strength training so i think that's

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.710 
strength training so i think that's
what's<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:40.020> best<00:05:40.349> for<00:05:40.919> me<00:05:41.099> um<00:05:41.910> I<00:05:41.970> can't<00:05:42.479> tell
