first you look at your pre make a bowl

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.650 
first you look at your pre make a bowl
and<00:00:48.260> identify<00:00:49.460> which<00:00:50.460> end<00:00:50.789> goes<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.140> end

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and identify which end goes to which end

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
and identify which end goes to which end
the<00:00:54.660> end<00:00:55.039> that<00:00:56.039> looks<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.579> he<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:56.969> an

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the end that looks like he has an

the end that looks like he has an
outside<00:00:58.109> shield<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
outside shield this will be for the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
outside shield this will be for the
camera<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.530> he<00:01:01.890> has<00:01:02.010> an<00:01:02.219> outside

camera as you see he has an outside
shield<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> camera<00:01:04.710> now

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
shield this will go for the camera now

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.350 
shield this will go for the camera now
that<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> know<00:01:06.200> we<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> side<00:01:08.360> let's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that we know we put it on the side let's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.770 
that we know we put it on the side let's
get<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> DVR<00:01:10.729> back<00:01:11.729> okay<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> get

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
get the DVR back okay so first we get

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.700 
get the DVR back okay so first we get
one<00:01:16.049> end<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.210> our<00:01:18.509> camp<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> our

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
one end and we get our camp this is our

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.910 
one end and we get our camp this is our
camera<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> power<00:01:22.259> came<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
camera we get the power came over the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.390 
camera we get the power came over the
camera

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
camera

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.120 
camera
then<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.150> connect<00:01:24.590> red<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.009> red<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
then we connect red to red like this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.410 
then we connect red to red like this
then<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.090> our<00:01:30.360> video<00:01:30.829> BNC<00:01:31.829> connection<00:01:32.820> we

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
then we get our video BNC connection we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
then we get our video BNC connection we
can<00:01:33.630> connect<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> green<00:01:34.710> port<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
can connect that to the green port on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.980 
can connect that to the green port on
the<00:01:35.549> table<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.770> locks<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.100> twists

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the table like this locks and twists

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.969 
the table like this locks and twists
then<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.299> 485<00:01:42.299> connection<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.799> we

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
then we get our 485 connection then we

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.100 
then we get our 485 connection then we
connect<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> 485<00:01:45.299> point<00:01:46.610> like<00:01:47.610> so

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
connect it to that 485 point like so

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.100 
connect it to that 485 point like so
this<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.950> video<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.790> scenario<00:01:51.329> for

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
this it's a video up scenario for

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
this it's a video up scenario for
portable<00:01:52.590> monitors<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.700> worry<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
portable monitors don't worry about this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
portable monitors don't worry about this
one<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.579> camera<00:01:57.740> connected

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
one now you have your camera connected

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.499 
one now you have your camera connected
to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> pre-made<00:01:59.969> cable

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.449 

let's<00:02:06.509> find<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.929> camera<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
let's find the camera this way which is

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.229 
let's find the camera this way which is
gonna<00:02:08.670> set<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> up<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:11.129> point<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.700> like

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
gonna set this up here and point it like

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.190 
gonna set this up here and point it like
this<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:13.410> right<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:14.489> let's<00:02:15.450> go<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.870> DVR

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
this all right now let's go to the DVR

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680 
this all right now let's go to the DVR
side<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.280> green<00:02:17.519> cable<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.360> you'll<00:02:18.660> be

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
side the green cable which is you'll be

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.839 
side the green cable which is you'll be
in<00:02:18.959> see<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.769> will<00:02:19.920> connect<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.549> any

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
in see you will connect it to the any

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:28.550 
in see you will connect it to the any
available<00:02:21.450> channels<00:02:24.830> then<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.489> rs-485<00:02:27.560> these

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
available channels then the rs-485 these

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400 
available channels then the rs-485 these
two<00:02:28.860> cables<00:02:29.340> will<00:02:30.000> connect<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> rs-485

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
two cables will connect to the rs-485

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.979 
two cables will connect to the rs-485
port<00:02:31.650> located<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.330> green<00:02:33.569> terminal

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
port located here it's a green terminal

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.610 
port located here it's a green terminal
block<00:02:34.610> he<00:02:35.610> has<00:02:35.879> red<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.599> black<00:02:37.019> red<00:02:37.440> is

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
block he has red and black red is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.720 
block he has red and black red is
positive<00:02:38.629> black<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.930> negative<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.010> make<00:02:41.700> sure

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
positive black is negative so make sure

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.839 
positive black is negative so make sure
you<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.209> which<00:02:42.360> one<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.720> which<00:02:43.700> all<00:02:44.700> right

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
you know which one is which all right

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.319 
you know which one is which all right
now<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.349> power<00:02:46.650> side<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.849> do<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.150> get

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
now the power side of it how do we get

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.339 
now the power side of it how do we get
power<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.430> our<00:02:50.730> power<00:02:51.000> picture<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
power we get our power picture the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.710 
power we get our power picture the
splitter<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.549> connect<00:02:54.060> any<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.510> the
