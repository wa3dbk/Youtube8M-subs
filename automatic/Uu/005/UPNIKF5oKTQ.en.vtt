back to Crowley's granit TV you know
there<00:00:04.319> are<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> lot<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.009> factors<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.640> consider

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
there are a lot of factors to consider

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.059 
there are a lot of factors to consider
when<00:00:06.210> thinking<00:00:06.629> about<00:00:07.230> buying<00:00:07.620> granite

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
when thinking about buying granite

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.080 
when thinking about buying granite
countertops<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.760> there<00:00:08.849> are<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> lot<00:00:09.059> of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
countertops and there are a lot of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.600 
countertops and there are a lot of
technical<00:00:09.660> elements<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.590> project<00:00:11.160> that

technical elements of the project that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.860 
technical elements of the project that
you<00:00:11.730> need<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.000> consider<00:00:12.360> when<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.780> are

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you need to consider when you are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.299 
you need to consider when you are
selecting<00:00:13.080> your<00:00:13.410> fabricator<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
selecting your fabricator and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
selecting your fabricator and
understanding<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.570> lot<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
understanding that there are a lot of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750

well<00:00:40.970> first<00:00:41.240> let's<00:00:41.510> chat<00:00:41.750> about<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.080> improper

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
well first let's chat about the improper

well first let's chat about the improper
installation<00:00:43.340> techniques<00:00:44.240> one<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> most

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
common approaches that we see when we're

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.090 
common approaches that we see when we're
called<00:00:47.570> out<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.900> do<00:00:48.020> warranty<00:00:48.500> work<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:48.890> other

called out to do warranty work on other
projects<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.750> adhesive<00:00:51.110> technique<00:00:51.830> where

projects is the adhesive technique where

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.390 
projects is the adhesive technique where

the sink begins to separate that
adhesive<00:01:21.110> bond<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.560> when<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.740> have<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.160> the

that they send a clip system with the
