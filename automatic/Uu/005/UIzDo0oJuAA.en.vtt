one<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:08.190> I<00:01:09.190> want<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.360> do<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:12.540> replacement<00:01:13.540> part

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
one and I want to do a replacement part

on a 2006 dodge ram 1500 5.7 liter Hemi
and<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.770> would<00:01:20.890> be<00:01:21.070> my<00:01:21.430> oil<00:01:22.119> pressure<00:01:22.600> switch

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
and that would be my oil pressure switch

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.180 
and that would be my oil pressure switch
or<00:01:24.130> sensor<00:01:24.759> whatever<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.240> want<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.420> call<00:01:25.540> it

or sensor whatever you want to call it
you<00:01:27.190> know<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.430> your<00:01:27.610> will<00:01:27.880> pressure<00:01:28.320> pressure

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you know if your will pressure pressure

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.670 
you know if your will pressure pressure
gauge<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> truck<00:01:31.539> is<00:01:31.840> going<00:01:32.320> from<00:01:32.409> half

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
gauge in the truck is going from half

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.520 
gauge in the truck is going from half
high<00:01:33.490> or<00:01:33.940> from<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.720> know<00:01:34.750> not<00:01:35.050> in<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.320> movement

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
high or from you know not in a movement

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.040 
high or from you know not in a movement
bouncing<00:01:35.979> around<00:01:36.119> most<00:01:37.119> likely<00:01:37.630> that's<00:01:37.869> what

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
bouncing around most likely that's what

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.380 
bouncing around most likely that's what
this<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.409> right<00:01:38.590> here<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.789> your<00:01:40.060> switch<00:01:40.360> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this is right here is your switch and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.999 
this is right here is your switch and
the<00:01:43.390> thing<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:46.030> use<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
the thing of it is you can use this this

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.469 
the thing of it is you can use this this
Ridge<00:01:48.310> here<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:50.229> will<00:01:50.530> fit<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:52.119> if<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.330> go

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
Ridge here it will fit but if you go

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.050 
Ridge here it will fit but if you go
from<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> top<00:01:53.550> you're<00:01:54.550> going<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.759> have<00:01:54.850> too

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
from the top you're going to have too

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.749 
from the top you're going to have too
many<00:01:55.179> hoses<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.140> parts<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.770> way<00:01:56.920> you're<00:01:57.610> not

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
many hoses and parts in a way you're not

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.680 
many hoses and parts in a way you're not
going<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.940> be<00:01:58.000> able<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.149> maneuver

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
going to be able to maneuver

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.960 
going to be able to maneuver
you<00:01:59.380> know<00:01:59.530> tighten<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.069> or<00:02:00.250> loosen<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.819> and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
you know tighten it or loosen it and

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.430 
you know tighten it or loosen it and
whatever<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.390> you're<00:02:04.780> going<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> come<00:02:05.229> up<00:02:05.350> from

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
whatever so you're going to come up from

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.380 
whatever so you're going to come up from
the<00:02:05.619> underneath<00:02:06.129> the<00:02:06.280> truck<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.610> over<00:02:06.970> top<00:02:07.239> of

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the underneath the truck and over top of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.990 
the underneath the truck and over top of
the<00:02:07.479> frame<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:08.280> getting<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.789> way

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the frame and getting in there that way

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.510 
the frame and getting in there that way
but<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.140> might<00:02:11.349> be<00:02:11.500> too<00:02:11.709> short<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:15.370> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
but these might be too short so then you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.900 
but these might be too short so then you
get<00:02:15.670> these<00:02:15.940> adjustable<00:02:16.780> clamps<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:18.670> works

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
get these adjustable clamps which works

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.869 
get these adjustable clamps which works
fine<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.690> they're<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.080> long<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.819> you

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
fine but they're so long you know you

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.360 
fine but they're so long you know you
can<00:02:22.150> only<00:02:22.270> move<00:02:22.450> about<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:23.220> maybe<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
can only move about you know maybe the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.100 
can only move about you know maybe the
eighth<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.670> an<00:02:24.760> inch<00:02:24.849> at<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> time<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.900> takes

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
eighth of an inch at a time so it takes

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.850 
eighth of an inch at a time so it takes
it<00:02:26.290> long

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
it long

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.300 
it long
um<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:28.510> know<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:29.170> got<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> 12<00:02:29.980> inch<00:02:30.099> adjustable

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
um you know I got a 12 inch adjustable

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.729 
um you know I got a 12 inch adjustable
wrench<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.900> too<00:02:32.080> long<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.560> in

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
wrench but then this is too long like in

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.440 
wrench but then this is too long like in
any<00:02:32.920> levers<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> smaller<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.330> but

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
any levers and I got a smaller one but

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.960 
any levers and I got a smaller one but
then<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:34.720> not<00:02:34.870> big<00:02:35.830> enough<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.129> go<00:02:36.640> around

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
then it's not big enough to go around

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.100 
then it's not big enough to go around
the<00:02:37.830> thing<00:02:38.830> air<00:02:40.410> um<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> I'll<00:02:43.780> show<00:02:44.080> you

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the thing air um so I'll show you

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.490 
the thing air um so I'll show you
exactly<00:02:44.440> worth<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.190> got<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.459> light<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.790> here

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
exactly worth that I got a light in here

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.119 
exactly worth that I got a light in here
to<00:02:47.500> help<00:02:47.709> point<00:02:47.980> where<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:50.129> the

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
to help point where it's at and the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.330 
to help point where it's at and the
winds<00:02:51.340> picking<00:02:51.580> up<00:02:51.730> here<00:02:53.129> hopefully<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.220> all

should be fine

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.100

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
but I would definitely if you can I

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.900 
but I would definitely if you can I
would<00:05:36.230> recommend<00:05:36.800> trying<00:05:37.010> to<00:05:37.220> tighten<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:37.700> at

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
would recommend trying to tighten it at
