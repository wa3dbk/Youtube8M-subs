00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.059
 Well, here I am going to bring you the 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 review of this game is simple is a 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.019
 little complicated yes but of what 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.119
 it consists of eating that we do not 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.550
 touch the skulls and we play two 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.560
 skulls we will automatically lose the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.300
 game we will have to grab food and 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.100
 we will have to avoid acts for 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.170
 avoid dying and make the highest score 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.789
 possible is a game that the truth is going 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 to despair a bit at the beginning but 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.509
 once you get used to it you're going to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.630
 To like too much was like the Pit Bull 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.030
 of those kinds of difficult games but 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.039
 after a while you will grab how 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.369
 play and it 's going to be much simpler 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.920
 it's a game in 8 bits, a theme 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.020
 very good the game really looks very 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.670
