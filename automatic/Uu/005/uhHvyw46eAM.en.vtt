00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.690 

we've<00:00:44.780> added<00:00:44.960> fluid<00:00:45.410> dynamics<00:00:45.950> interactive

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.660 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive
smoke<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.360> also<00:00:47.780> added<00:00:48.170> an<00:00:48.320> AI<00:00:48.560> system<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:49.520> it

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
smoke and also added an AI system to it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.240 
smoke and also added an AI system to it
so<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.150> have<00:00:50.360> fish<00:00:51.020> move<00:00:51.739> out<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.100> way<00:00:52.130> when

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
so we have fish move out of the way when

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:18.190 
so we have fish move out of the way when
you<00:00:52.610> get<00:00:52.760> close<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.180> them

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.510 

we<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> new<00:01:19.440> mantel<00:01:19.800> system<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> when

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we have a new mantel system so that when

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.620 
we have a new mantel system so that when
you're<00:01:20.640> running<00:01:20.820> quickly<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.450> hit<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you're running quickly and you hit a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
you're running quickly and you hit a
wall<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.620> get<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> nice<00:01:23.040> boom<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.760> hit<00:01:23.940> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
wall you get this nice boom you hit it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.280 
wall you get this nice boom you hit it
and<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> leap<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.140> just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and you leap and you go and you just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
and you leap and you go and you just
maintain<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.740> momentum<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
maintain your momentum but we have to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520 
maintain your momentum but we have to
lean<00:01:27.150> feature<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.750> allows<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> lean<00:01:28.380> out

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
lean feature that allows you lean out

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.500 
lean feature that allows you lean out
and<00:01:28.770> lean<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.370> get<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.030> view<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
and lean in and get a better view of the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.060 
and lean in and get a better view of the
battlefield<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.470> another<00:01:31.620> feature<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
battlefield so another feature that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
battlefield so another feature that
working<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.520> animation<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> slide<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
working with animation is the slide it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.900 
working with animation is the slide it
allows<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.920> somewhere<00:01:35.250> quickly<00:01:35.310> get

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
allows you to get somewhere quickly get

allows you to get somewhere quickly get
out<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.330> line<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.510> fire<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> same

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
out of the line of fire and at the same

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
out of the line of fire and at the same
time<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.700> cool<00:01:38.940> looking<00:01:39.330> away
