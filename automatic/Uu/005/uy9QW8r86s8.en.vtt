one that we have right in front of us is

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.060 
one that we have right in front of us is
called<00:00:39.730> Hesco<00:00:40.030> cart<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:41.380> it<00:00:41.590> addresses<00:00:41.890> some

of the feedback that we've heard about
how<00:00:43.690> difficult<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.260> can<00:00:44.290> be<00:00:44.410> sometimes<00:00:44.800> to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
how difficult it can be sometimes to

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.490 
how difficult it can be sometimes to
manually<00:00:46.150> set<00:00:46.390> them<00:00:46.570> up<00:00:46.690> by<00:00:46.840> standing<00:00:47.200> up<00:00:47.320> on<00:00:47.470> a

flat<00:00:54.910> packed<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.300> pallet<00:00:55.660> and<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.900> couple

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
flat packed on a pallet and so a couple

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.870 
flat packed on a pallet and so a couple
of<00:00:56.230> soldiers<00:00:56.410> would<00:00:56.650> pick<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:56.890> up<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.160> it's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
of soldiers would pick it up and it's

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.820 
of soldiers would pick it up and it's
not<00:00:57.970> too<00:00:58.150> much<00:00:58.300> it's<00:00:58.510> all<00:00:58.600> about<00:00:58.870> 150<00:00:59.500> pounds

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
not too much it's all about 150 pounds

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.140 
not too much it's all about 150 pounds
for<00:00:59.980> two<00:01:00.070> soldiers<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.460> pick<00:01:00.580> up<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:00.820> pull<00:01:00.970> out

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
for two soldiers to pick up and pull out

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.270 
for two soldiers to pick up and pull out
but<00:01:01.690> still<00:01:01.900> it's<00:01:02.080> a<00:01:02.200> it's<00:01:02.470> a<00:01:02.560> manual<00:01:02.890> part<00:01:03.220> of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
but still it's a it's a manual part of

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.860 
but still it's a it's a manual part of
the<00:01:03.340> process<00:01:03.760> all<00:01:04.000> right<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.449> try<00:01:04.809> to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
the process all right that we try to

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.240 
the process all right that we try to
eliminate<00:01:05.140> because<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:05.710> had<00:01:06.070> heard<00:01:06.220> that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
eliminate because we had heard that

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.610 
eliminate because we had heard that
feedback<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:07.060> in<00:01:07.660> that's<00:01:07.990> what<00:01:08.140> came<00:01:08.350> into<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
feedback so in that's what came into the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.380 
feedback so in that's what came into the
innovation<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.250> design<00:01:09.580> yes<00:01:10.090> sir<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
innovation of this design yes sir the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.960 
innovation of this design yes sir the
cart<00:01:10.930> system<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:11.410> is<00:01:11.830> packed<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> single

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
cart system is is packed on a single

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.370 
cart system is is packed on a single
pallet<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> units<00:01:13.630> are<00:01:13.720> already<00:01:13.960> standing<00:01:14.140> up

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
pallet the units are already standing up

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.630 
pallet the units are already standing up
as<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.680> see<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.010> there<00:01:15.130> they're

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
as you can see that there they're

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.730 
as you can see that there they're
delivered<00:01:16.030> vertically<00:01:16.420> like<00:01:16.570> this<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:17.590> is

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
delivered vertically like this this is

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.440 
delivered vertically like this this is
just<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.950> smaller<00:01:18.190> demo<00:01:18.520> unit<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.330> in

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
just a smaller demo unit so so in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.240 
just a smaller demo unit so so in
reality<00:01:19.870> this<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.470> tightly<00:01:20.770> packed<00:01:20.980> section

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
reality this this tightly packed section

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.380 
reality this this tightly packed section
you<00:01:21.340> see<00:01:21.490> would<00:01:21.610> continue<00:01:21.940> all<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.150> way<00:01:22.270> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
you see would continue all the way to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.240 
you see would continue all the way to
the<00:01:22.540> front<00:01:22.780> edge<00:01:22.960> right<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.830> pallet<00:01:24.160> and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
the front edge right of the pallet and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.970 
the front edge right of the pallet and
so<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.490> pallet<00:01:24.850> holds<00:01:25.180> 80<00:01:25.630> meters<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.350> barrier

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
so the pallet holds 80 meters of barrier

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.330 
so the pallet holds 80 meters of barrier
about<00:01:27.220> 240<00:01:28.030> feet<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.350> considerably

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
about 240 feet which is considerably

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.450 
about 240 feet which is considerably
more<00:01:30.400> than<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.380> previous<00:01:32.560> pallets<00:01:33.280> could

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
more than the previous pallets could

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.940 
more than the previous pallets could
hold<00:01:33.640> them<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.900> show<00:01:35.140> us<00:01:35.170> unless<00:01:35.710> you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
hold them so can you show us unless you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.830 
hold them so can you show us unless you
want<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.130> demonstrate<00:01:36.430> for<00:01:36.970> everybody<00:01:37.330> see

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
want to demonstrate for everybody see

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.490 
want to demonstrate for everybody see
how<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:38.110> goes

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
how it goes

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.890 
how it goes
sure<00:01:38.710> I'd<00:01:38.860> love<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.100> okay<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:39.700> as<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.840> see

that if you can see what's going on in

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.469 
that if you can see what's going on in
video<00:01:42.700> up<00:01:42.820> here<00:01:42.940> we're<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.270> do<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
video up here we're going to do that

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.450 
video up here we're going to do that
we're<00:01:43.630> gonna<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.870> that<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.110> person<00:01:44.470> here<00:01:44.620> to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
we're gonna do that in person here to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.590 
we're gonna do that in person here to
start<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.880> these<00:01:45.940> off<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.150> couple<00:01:46.450> of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
start one of these off a couple of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.969 
start one of these off a couple of
soldiers<00:01:46.720> would<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.110> grab<00:01:47.260> grab<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.800> last

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
soldiers would just grab grab the last

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.860 
soldiers would just grab grab the last
unit<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.460> they'll<00:01:48.580> pull<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.330> off<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.720> you'll

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
unit and they'll pull it off and you'll

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.590 
unit and they'll pull it off and you'll
see<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.170> they<00:01:50.320> unfold<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.150> each<00:01:52.390> come

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
see that they unfold and they each come

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.180 
see that they unfold and they each come
right<00:01:52.810> off<00:01:52.840> right<00:01:53.350> after<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.620> pallet<00:01:53.950> and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
right off right after the pallet and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.520 
right off right after the pallet and
then<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:55.420> part<00:01:55.690> would<00:01:55.990> be<00:01:56.050> anchored

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
then this this part would be anchored

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.160 
then this this part would be anchored
down<00:01:56.680> one<00:01:57.130> would<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.850> would<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.420> would<00:01:58.810> stake

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
down one would you would you would stake

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.050 
down one would you would you would stake
it<00:01:59.320> or<00:01:59.470> partially<00:02:00.190> fill<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.610> one<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
it or partially fill the one of the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.000 
it or partially fill the one of the
first<00:02:01.240> cells<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.690> then<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.380> would<00:02:02.500> drag<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
first cells and then you would drag the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.440 
first cells and then you would drag the
remainder<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.460> pallet<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.210> direction

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
remainder of the pallet in the direction

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.910 
remainder of the pallet in the direction
that<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.659> wanted<00:02:04.870> your<00:02:04.960> barrier<00:02:05.200> using<00:02:05.620> any

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
that you wanted your barrier using any

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.950 
that you wanted your barrier using any
sort<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> vehicle<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.760> that's<00:02:07.570> capable<00:02:07.750> of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
sort of vehicle that that's capable of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.800 
sort of vehicle that that's capable of
pulling<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.349> which<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.590> important<00:02:09.069> or<00:02:09.280> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
pulling it which is important or you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.990 
pulling it which is important or you
possibly<00:02:10.740> if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> couple<00:02:11.850> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
possibly if you got you got a couple of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.070 
possibly if you got you got a couple of
you<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.240> couple<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> husky<00:02:12.720> guys<00:02:12.870> they

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you got a couple of husky guys they

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.750 
you got a couple of husky guys they
don't<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> drag<00:02:13.560> around<00:02:13.709> some<00:02:14.550> people

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
don't want to drag around some people

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't want to drag around some people
will<00:02:14.850> use<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.300> bobcat<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.900> civil<00:02:16.530> sites<00:02:16.770> or

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
will use just a bobcat in civil sites or

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520 
will use just a bobcat in civil sites or
or<00:02:17.580> any<00:02:17.819> kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.240> wheeled<00:02:18.780> vehicle<00:02:19.230> will<00:02:19.440> be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
or any kind of wheeled vehicle will be

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.780 
or any kind of wheeled vehicle will be
able<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> drag<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.100> because<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> probably

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
able to drag this because you probably

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.270 
able to drag this because you probably
would<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.209> Bobcat<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.020> fill<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> yes<00:02:22.920> yeah

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
would have a Bobcat to fill it yes yeah

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.559 
would have a Bobcat to fill it yes yeah
of<00:02:23.370> course<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> Bobcats<00:02:24.000> typically<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.390> site

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
of course the Bobcats typically on site

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.270 
of course the Bobcats typically on site
to<00:02:24.660> fill<00:02:24.840> them<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.770> why<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.130> one's

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
to fill them so so that's why that one's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
to fill them so so that's why that one's
very<00:02:26.340> often<00:02:26.760> used<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.330> show<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
very often used so show me the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.280 
very often used so show me the
disassembly<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.110> actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
disassembly because these can actually

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.979 
disassembly because these can actually
be<00:02:31.470> reused<00:02:32.280> absolutely<00:02:32.970> uh<00:02:33.000> another<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.900> of

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
be reused absolutely uh another one of

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.240 
be reused absolutely uh another one of
the<00:02:34.050> another<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.620> gonna<00:02:34.770> come<00:02:34.890> around<00:02:34.980> here

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the another I'm gonna come around here

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.620 
the another I'm gonna come around here
to<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.430> side<00:02:35.640> second<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.420> show<00:02:36.569> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
to this side second so I can show you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.540 
to this side second so I can show you
one<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.220> pieces<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.459> feedback

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
one of the one of the pieces of feedback

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.830 
one of the one of the pieces of feedback
that<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:38.910> got<00:02:39.000> previously<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.750> can

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that we got previously was that it can

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
that we got previously was that it can
be<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:40.110> very<00:02:40.290> difficult<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.800> remove<00:02:41.069> these

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
be very very difficult to remove these

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.790 
be very very difficult to remove these
you<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.209> they're<00:02:42.330> designed<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.930> exactly

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
you know they're designed to be exactly

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.990 
you know they're designed to be exactly
a<00:02:43.860> very<00:02:44.130> robust<00:02:45.090> barrier<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:47.130> as<00:02:47.610> such

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
a very robust barrier and so as as such

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.670 
a very robust barrier and so as as such
they<00:02:48.239> tend<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.930> stay<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.320> occasionally

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
they tend to stay there but occasionally

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.530 
they tend to stay there but occasionally
we<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> demobilize<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.300> remove

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
we need to demobilize we want to remove

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.220 
we need to demobilize we want to remove
barriers<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> past<00:02:54.900> they've

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
barriers and so in the past they've

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.690 
barriers and so in the past they've
frequently<00:02:55.410> been<00:02:55.769> simply<00:02:56.069> bulldozed<00:02:56.519> or

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
frequently been simply bulldozed or

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
frequently been simply bulldozed or
knocked<00:02:56.880> over<00:02:57.209> with<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> payloader

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
knocked over with a with a payloader

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.440 
knocked over with a with a payloader
okay<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.400> effective<00:02:59.819> but<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.180> but

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
okay and that's effective but you but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.479 
okay and that's effective but you but
the<00:03:00.510> result<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.050> large<00:03:01.380> pile<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.980> twisted

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
the result is a large pile of twisted

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.340 
the result is a large pile of twisted
metal<00:03:02.790> sort<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.330> bird's<00:03:03.510> nest<00:03:03.660> right<00:03:03.930> very

very light but it's very big hard to
handle<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.610> heard<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.910> feedback<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:10.080> said

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
handle so we heard that feedback we said

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.150 
handle so we heard that feedback we said
well<00:03:10.380> we'd<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.830> something<00:03:11.069> that's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
well we'd like to have something that's

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.490 
well we'd like to have something that's
recoverable<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.910> buy<00:03:12.750> recoverable<00:03:13.319> ween

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
recoverable and buy recoverable ween

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.229 
recoverable and buy recoverable ween
that<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.040> can<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.280> removed<00:03:14.610> relatively

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
that we it can be removed relatively

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.840 
that we it can be removed relatively
easily<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.810> possibly<00:03:16.739> even<00:03:16.829> reused<00:03:17.400> although

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
easily and possibly even reused although

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.220 
easily and possibly even reused although
that's<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.600> know<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.810> depends<00:03:19.049> on<00:03:19.140> the

that's you know that depends on the

and you see behind you there's another

and you see behind you there's another
one<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.239> there<00:03:27.390> they're<00:03:27.660> each<00:03:27.780> attached<00:03:28.079> with

one staple those have been ripped
already<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.209> okay<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.019> pop<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> one

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
already at okay right so you pop the one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.199 
already at okay right so you pop the one
staple<00:03:31.739> up<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.130> then<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> pull<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.760> pin<00:03:33.000> at

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
staple up and then you pull the pin at

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.120 
staple up and then you pull the pin at
every<00:03:34.110> corner<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:35.340> open<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.890> all<00:03:37.890> of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
every corner and it's open and so all of

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.890 
every corner and it's open and so all of
the<00:03:38.190> contents<00:03:38.579> come<00:03:38.700> out<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.120> each<00:03:39.540> corner

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
the contents come out so each corner

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.170 
the contents come out so each corner
each<00:03:40.260> corner<00:03:40.500> can<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.769> opened<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.609> they<00:03:41.940> come

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
each corner can be opened and they come

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.080 
each corner can be opened and they come
apart<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:42.810> every<00:03:43.970> cell<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.459> sand<00:03:47.670> can<00:03:47.880> so

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
apart at every cell so the sand can so

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.190 
apart at every cell so the sand can so
this<00:03:48.209> hand<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.510> be<00:03:48.540> removed<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.049> fill
