00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
removing the old battery the best tool

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.430 
removing the old battery the best tool
you<00:00:06.290> have<00:00:06.319> is<00:00:06.890> your<00:00:07.279> eyes<00:00:08.050> before<00:00:09.050> you<00:00:09.230> reach

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
you have is your eyes before you reach

you have is your eyes before you reach
in<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:09.890> start<00:00:10.250> pulling<00:00:10.460> out<00:00:10.790> an<00:00:11.030> old<00:00:11.150> battery

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
in and start pulling out an old battery

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.260 
in and start pulling out an old battery
take<00:00:12.410> a<00:00:12.440> close<00:00:12.830> look<00:00:12.980> at<00:00:13.250> everything<00:00:13.700> in<00:00:14.060> the

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
take a close look at everything in the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.269 
take a close look at everything in the
immediate<00:00:14.510> area<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:15.290> where<00:00:15.530> the<00:00:15.680> battery<00:00:16.010> is

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
immediate area of where the battery is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.089 
immediate area of where the battery is
in<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.699> watch<00:00:17.259> take<00:00:18.259> note<00:00:18.529> of<00:00:18.560> which<00:00:18.800> side<00:00:19.039> of

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
in the watch take note of which side of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.460 
in the watch take note of which side of
the<00:00:19.310> battery<00:00:19.759> is<00:00:19.939> up<00:00:20.150> before<00:00:20.480> you<00:00:20.900> remove<00:00:21.109> it

the battery is up before you remove it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.470 
the battery is up before you remove it
so<00:00:22.039> that<00:00:22.249> you<00:00:22.400> know<00:00:22.579> which<00:00:22.789> direction<00:00:23.060> to

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
so that you know which direction to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.609 
so that you know which direction to
