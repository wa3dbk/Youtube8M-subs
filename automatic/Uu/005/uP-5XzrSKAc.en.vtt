00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 and now we go to caracas to know 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 the opinion on this issue of the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.670
 political scientist susana khalil 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.330
 welcome and good as we saw makes a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.860
 moment 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.620
 the Syrian government denied the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.750
 accusations of war and said that those 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.060
 accusations are based on stories made 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 public by insurgents because usa 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 then supposedly enjoy a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.029
 advanced intelligence system and it's 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.080
 following information expired and until 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.080
 certain false point 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 look is totally behind this are not 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.250
 the care behind this is not 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.040
 really the fact of chemical weapons 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.030
 we are very well clear that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.900
 the US is looking to bomb still 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:55.320
 to a town in this case to Syria and 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.720
 and really this is the product of a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 imperialist position we are in the century 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.970
 21 unfortunately in our time 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.370
 historical is still stuck in that 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 atrophy in that fact that is the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.580
 imperialism and imperialism is a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 attack on all principles of the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 democracy of respect for sovereignty and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 of human rights is about a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.420
 of an empire that obeys interests 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.369
 economic and seeks of course 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.520
 run over needs to run over to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.440
 to be able to sustain ourselves now we have seen that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.119
 in the USA has suffered a series of 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.680
 low for example england is not going to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 participate germany is also not going to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 participate but it will only go worse or it will 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 go with others and how will you go will go with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.070
 the support financed by petrodollars 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.050
 for the petrodollars of the dictatorship and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 xanica from Saudi Arabia which is the one 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.840
 will finance this not against the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 Syrian people 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.310
 and that because the Saudi regime is the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 first that scares 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.649
 before any social movements or 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.049
 politicians that exist in the middle 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.430
 East they know very well that they 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.080
 they are the big losers in the case of 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.720
 see the emergence of movements 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.370
 democratic in the Middle East and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.379
 they have to finish it and they are 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.019
 seizing and making kidnap 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.599
 everything that can happen in favor of a 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.519
 rise or democracy in the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 middle east and supported by the states 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.560
 united that is the great contradiction not 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.340
 we want 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.020
 finally you also have to see this 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 related to war economies 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.710
 Of course this is obviously 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.630
 war economy mathematics but 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.710
 It is important to note that the one who is 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:54.360
 making the lobby in the USA bigger 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:57.480
 against the favor for example of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.120
 bomb and make an inhuman attack 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.150
 against the Syrian people is the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.770
 Saudi dictatorship to that a dictatorship 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.460
 Arab and that may has the power 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.380
 economic to finance it and sure that 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.270
 here behind this is about a 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.930
 economy we are there is a crisis in the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.610
 neoliberal economy and that does not fall 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.830
 nothing bad 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.100
 have control of the most important resource 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.550
 of contemporary civilization that is 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.140
 oil and good lives here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.720
 human rights do not count here 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.540
 humans do not count and what the USA is 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.370
 great threat of world peace usa el 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.410
 that more hurts human rights 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.080
 in the USA also a meteor say that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.480
 it is also in the 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.460
 of these regimes that run over the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.140
 human rights that will finance that 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.850
 they will also protect dictatorships in the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.470
 World USA is the great threat of the world 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.330
 today there is just like the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.069
 Zionist movement that have 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:05.810
 become for example in the great 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.819
 a core that has generated great discomfort 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.019
 in everything the Middle East in the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.730
 Arab world where he has never been able 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 since after the second war 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.479
 world and see a stability and they have 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.320
 always seen peoples threatened 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.620
 Arabs because of the Zionist movement 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.360
 international and unfortunately 21st century 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.130
 we are still talking about imperialism 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.810
 it is an attack on humanity on 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.699
 imperialism is something that should 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.330
 disappear imperialism is something that 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.789
 that is completely anachronistic and that 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.300
 we have to put an end if we want to advance in 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.160
 a world of peace a nobler world a 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.169
 more generous world a world of greater 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.080
 Understanding of sovereign balance 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.210
 of freedom of democracy we can not 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.460
 talk about democracy and look 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.889
 fat and silence before the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.479
 imperialist realities the empire a 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.130
 attack on humanity 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.810
 The US is the biggest attack today of 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.690
 threat against humanity 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.160
 with everything that uses and instrumentalizes 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.020
 the values ​​of democracy of the 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.490
 human rights but that is nothing more than 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.690
 to rape him is just a 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.090
 strategy through the means of 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.970
