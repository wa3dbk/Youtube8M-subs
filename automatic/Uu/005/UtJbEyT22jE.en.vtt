00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.699
 entered the unb at age 17 went on 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 when he attended the 2nd year of the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.020
 high school 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 even without completing 50% of high school 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 she says that the task of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859
 enter university 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.949
 We have a lot of preparation there since 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.850
 the first year of high school so that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.420
 we participate to people to interact 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 as fast as possible 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 cases like this are common since 2011 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.730
 about 900 applications for the anticipation of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 high school 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 registered in the federal district 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.719
 with these data the board of directors 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 public education of a state 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.399
 which prohibits the entry of students into 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.390
 universities without the completion of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 medium 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.000
 the decision making an exception only for 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.909
 gifted is worth for colleges 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.869
 public and private but the subject is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.640
 controversial 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.909
 to the supervisory coordinator 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 institutional and educational norms the student 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.750
 often is not prepared city ​​the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.970
 student is still a teenager, right? 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 And for what we have a sense of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 research done personally in the unb 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 event catholic university ne 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.189
 the majority of these students present this 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.240
 entering is a necessity with the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.020
 anticipated is to join the university 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.750
 shows a very great maturity, right? 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.759
 and feel safe to a large extent not 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 not finish that course that they 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 choose initially 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.799
 in there is to seek other courses is not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.280
 well this the students and mainly 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.770
 public school when you can pass 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.370
 in the vestibular I believe that they 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.300
 that we have to be supported in the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.920
 true because it is not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 It is easy and if we succeeded it was by merit 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.290
 was by much study and much effort of the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.960
 pupil and teacher's school then 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 so it has to be encouraged and not 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.360
 this lawyer says that the decision 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 whether or not to enter a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.210
 university without finishing high school 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.650
 depends on each state and the court of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.470
 regional justice 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.260
 he also says that there are two ways 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.450
 to apply for college enrollment or 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860
 certificate of anticipation 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.780
 there are already some precedents 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.880
 especially here in the court of 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.760
 federal district court in the sense that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.310
 to accept the writ of mandamus which is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.780
 one possible way in which the person the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.440
 concerned shall prove the right to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.260
 liquid and certain or an ordinary share in 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.050
 that there is a greater possibility of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.420
 proof of proof of his or her 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.510
 right in the case that would be your 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.680
 capacity and merit for admission 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.770
 at the University 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.140
 it's just these two is kind and 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.989
 possible procedural requirements for a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.489
 punctual service in each case 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.970
 now it does not 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:32.050
 possibility of further action 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.470
 public civil service in which these 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.310
 a possible decision to be extended 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.310
 for other people
