00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
3 really so let's draw some possible

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
3 really so let's draw some possible
scenarios<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.930> could<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> first

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
scenarios that could have and the first

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
scenarios that could have and the first
one<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> kid<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> taken<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.750> next<00:00:30.990> one

the<00:00:31.560> parents<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:32.189> taken<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.600> gonna<00:00:33.870> guess

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the parents are taken so I'm gonna guess

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920 
the parents are taken so I'm gonna guess
that<00:00:34.559> he<00:00:34.980> takes<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.760> bad<00:00:36.000> guys<00:00:36.300> somewhere

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that he takes the bad guys somewhere

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
that he takes the bad guys somewhere
taken<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.520> he's<00:00:38.670> gonna<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> Iraq<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
taken and then he's gonna go to Iraq and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.240 
taken and then he's gonna go to Iraq and
kidnap<00:00:40.260> some<00:00:40.500> people<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.920> they're<00:00:41.129> gonna

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
kidnap some people and they're gonna

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.540 
kidnap some people and they're gonna
