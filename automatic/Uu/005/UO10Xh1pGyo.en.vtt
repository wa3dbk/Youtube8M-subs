00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
I'm gonna go ahead and let this sit on

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.630 
I'm gonna go ahead and let this sit on
my<00:02:56.090> eye<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.600> fully<00:02:56.960> set<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.650> takes<00:02:57.890> about<00:02:58.070> five

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
my eye and fully set it takes about five

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240 
my eye and fully set it takes about five
minutes<00:02:58.670> before<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.870> completely<00:03:00.380> dry<00:03:00.800> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
minutes before it is completely dry and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.550 
minutes before it is completely dry and
once<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.420> completely<00:03:02.870> dry<00:03:03.230> then<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.470> can

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
once it is completely dry then you can

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.490 
once it is completely dry then you can
blend<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.220> your<00:03:04.370> heart's<00:03:04.790> content<00:03:05.050> but<00:03:06.050> before

blend to your heart's content but before

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.200 
blend to your heart's content but before
it's<00:03:06.710> dry<00:03:07.040> don't<00:03:07.310> attempt<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.850> blend<00:03:08.030> it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
it's dry don't attempt to blend it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's dry don't attempt to blend it
because<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.720> will<00:03:08.810> become<00:03:08.960> real<00:03:09.290> splotchy<00:03:09.740> if

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
because it will become real splotchy if

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.950 
because it will become real splotchy if
you<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.360> meantime<00:03:11.540> while<00:03:11.930> I'm

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
you do so in the meantime while I'm

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.810 
you do so in the meantime while I'm
waiting<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.980> dry<00:03:13.250> up<00:03:13.460> there<00:03:13.670> I'm

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
waiting on that to dry up there I'm

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820 
waiting on that to dry up there I'm
going<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.000> take<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.330> NYX<00:03:14.570> jumbo<00:03:14.840> pencil<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
milk line water line here with it just a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.030 
milk line water line here with it just a
tiny<00:03:20.690> amount<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.320> don't<00:03:21.530> want<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.950> be

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
tiny amount I don't want this to be

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.670 
tiny amount I don't want this to be
super<00:03:22.250> bright<00:03:22.990> but<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.170> does<00:03:24.380> help<00:03:24.620> to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
super bright but it does help to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.140 
super bright but it does help to
brighten<00:03:24.980> up<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.190> look<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.760> little<00:03:26.030> bit

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
brighten up the look just a little bit

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.850 
brighten up the look just a little bit
more<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.570> step<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.050> completely<00:03:27.680> optional

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
more this step is completely optional

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.100 
more this step is completely optional
what<00:03:28.550> I'm<00:03:28.640> going<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.820> do<00:03:28.970> next<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.630> take<00:03:29.930> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
what I'm going to do next is take the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.350 
what I'm going to do next is take the
Mac<00:03:30.260> 263<00:03:31.100> brush<00:03:31.430> with<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> little<00:03:32.209> bit<00:03:32.330> of

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
Mac 263 brush with a little bit of

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360 
Mac 263 brush with a little bit of
copper<00:03:32.750> being<00:03:32.930> pigment<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.830> align<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
copper being pigment on it and align the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.400 
copper being pigment on it and align the
entire<00:03:34.790> lower<00:03:35.330> lash<00:03:35.630> line<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.080> make<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.260> eye

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
entire lower lash line to make the eye

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.650 
entire lower lash line to make the eye
pop<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:37.130> little<00:03:37.490> bit<00:03:37.730> more<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.570> do

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
pop a little bit more but I do

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.840 
pop a little bit more but I do
understand<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.440> doing<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.310> make<00:03:40.580> some

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
understand that doing this can make some

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.449 
understand that doing this can make some
people<00:03:41.030> look<00:03:41.450> sickly<00:03:41.750> because<00:03:42.230> red<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
people look sickly because red on the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.100 
people look sickly because red on the
lower<00:03:43.580> lash<00:03:43.850> line<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.300> really<00:03:44.630> hard<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.959> wear

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
lower lash line is really hard to wear

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.140 
lower lash line is really hard to wear
so<00:03:45.560> that's<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.010> case<00:03:46.190> for<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.790> can<00:03:46.940> also

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
so that's the case for you you can also

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.480 
so that's the case for you you can also
replace<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.260> color<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> deep<00:03:49.220> dark

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
replace this color with a deep dark

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:59.620 
replace this color with a deep dark
brown<00:03:56.650> our<00:03:57.650> pigment<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.280> fully<00:03:58.730> set<00:03:59.150> now<00:03:59.360> and

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
brown our pigment is fully set now and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.240 
brown our pigment is fully set now and
we<00:03:59.750> are<00:03:59.930> ready<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.440> blend<00:04:00.680> so<00:04:01.010> what<00:04:01.100> I'm<00:04:01.160> going

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
we are ready to blend so what I'm going
