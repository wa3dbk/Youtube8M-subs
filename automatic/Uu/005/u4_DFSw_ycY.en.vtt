00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
can see like my six-month video to show

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.860 
can see like my six-month video to show
when<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:47.940> hair<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> lot<00:00:48.420> shorter

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
when my hair was a lot shorter

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
when my hair was a lot shorter
you<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.600> rub<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.629> head<00:00:53.090> basically<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you just rub your head basically like

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.959 
you just rub your head basically like
this<00:00:54.750> while<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.230> washing<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.129> that's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this while you're washing it and that's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.889 
this while you're washing it and that's
like<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.510> clockwise<00:01:00.510> motion

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
like I don't know a clockwise motion

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
like I don't know a clockwise motion
that's<00:01:01.739> basically<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.399> did<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> start

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that's basically what I did is start

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.050 
that's basically what I did is start
here<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.660> around<00:01:04.489> start<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> right

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
here and go around start on the right

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.620 
here and go around start on the right
side<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.619> around<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.630> go

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
side and then go around the back go

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
side and then go around the back go
around<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> top<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:12.000> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
around the top and then I would just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.350 
around the top and then I would just
switch<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:13.110> left<00:01:13.140> hand<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> left<00:01:13.979> side

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
switch to my left hand on the left side

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.460 
switch to my left hand on the left side
like<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.080> while<00:01:19.320> you're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
like this so all of this while you're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.760 
like this so all of this while you're
washing<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:20.040> head<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:21.409> obviously<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
washing your head and then obviously you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
washing your head and then obviously you
rinse<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> rinse<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.670> head<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
rinse it you rinse out your head and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.830 
rinse it you rinse out your head and
then<00:01:24.950> basically<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.759> hair<00:01:26.939> starts<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.509> lock

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
then basically your hair starts to lock

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920 
then basically your hair starts to lock
up<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.380> its<00:01:28.590> own<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.720> don't

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
up on its own and from there you don't

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
up on its own and from there you don't
really<00:01:31.079> need<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.710> anything<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.490> would<00:01:32.790> just

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
really need to do anything I would just

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.590 
really need to do anything I would just
every<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> wash<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:34.170> head<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:35.180> would<00:01:36.180> do

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
every time I wash my head I would do

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
every time I wash my head I would do
that<00:01:36.750> same<00:01:37.020> motion<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.430> head<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that same motion and my head would just

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
that same motion and my head would just
basically<00:01:39.810> start<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> lock<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.340> its<00:01:41.490> own

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
basically start to lock up on its own

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
basically start to lock up on its own
and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.439> leave<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and then from there you just leave it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then from there you just leave it
and<00:01:44.729> eventually<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.649> gonna<00:01:46.770> grow<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and eventually it's gonna grow out and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
and eventually it's gonna grow out and
obviously<00:01:48.329> everybody's<00:01:48.810> hair<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.049> different

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
obviously everybody's hair is different

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
obviously everybody's hair is different
something<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.100> maybe<00:01:50.549> depending<00:01:51.030> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
something like this maybe depending on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
something like this maybe depending on
how<00:01:51.299> curly<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.930> hair<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> texture<00:01:53.070> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
how curly your hair is at a texture your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
how curly your hair is at a texture your
head<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.720> uh<00:01:54.829> it'll<00:01:55.829> keep<00:01:55.979> growing<00:01:56.159> out

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
head and it uh it'll keep growing out

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.130 
head and it uh it'll keep growing out
from<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.149> long<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> try<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> take

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
from there as long as you try to take

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.090 
from there as long as you try to take
care<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> keep<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.159> healthy<00:01:59.340> and
