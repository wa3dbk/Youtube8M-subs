00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
okay this is a demo of my headless

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
okay this is a demo of my headless
Guitar<00:00:10.559> Rig<00:00:11.119> so<00:00:12.119> I<00:00:12.150> call<00:00:12.510> it<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.670> over<00:00:14.670> there<00:00:14.820> is

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
Guitar Rig so I call it so over there is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.490 
Guitar Rig so I call it so over there is
the<00:00:15.059> V<00:00:15.209> amp<00:00:15.360> 3<00:00:15.920> on<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:18.470> any<00:00:19.470> metal<00:00:20.449> model<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.660> don't

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the V amp 3 on a any metal model I don't

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
the V amp 3 on a any metal model I don't
even<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.830> amp<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> isn't<00:00:23.609> any<00:00:23.759> better

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
even know what amp it isn't any better

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.150 
even know what amp it isn't any better
look<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.500> sounds<00:00:25.830> good

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
look but it sounds good

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.239 
look but it sounds good
the<00:00:26.730> next<00:00:26.999> to<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.179> is<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.919> BK<00:00:28.919> Butler

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
the next to that is the the BK Butler

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.120 
the next to that is the the BK Butler
tube<00:00:29.490> driver<00:00:29.759> which<00:00:30.089> is<00:00:30.119> before<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
tube driver which is before that and it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
tube driver which is before that and it
goes<00:00:32.220> out<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> there<00:00:32.730> into<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.750> preamp<00:00:34.140> over

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
goes out of there into the preamp over

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.529 
goes out of there into the preamp over
there<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> preamp<00:00:36.239> into

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
there and then I have the preamp into

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.020 
there and then I have the preamp into
the<00:00:36.690> 44<00:00:37.350> Magnum<00:00:37.379> into<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.129> Marshall<00:00:38.489> 112<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the 44 Magnum into the Marshall 112 I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
the 44 Magnum into the Marshall 112 I
have<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> low<00:00:39.960> volume<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
have it a low volume but pretty much it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.939 
have it a low volume but pretty much it
sounds<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> high<00:00:43.289> volume<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.859> it

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
sounds the same at a high volume as it

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.189 
sounds the same at a high volume as it
does<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> louvain<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:46.170> know

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
does in louvain because it's you know

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.920 
does in louvain because it's you know
there's<00:00:46.440> no<00:00:46.590> real<00:00:47.160> output<00:00:47.969> tubes<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
there's no real output tubes to it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
there's no real output tubes to it
there's<00:00:49.230> technically<00:00:49.769> no<00:00:49.980> real<00:00:50.219> preamp<00:00:50.609> tubes

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
there's technically no real preamp tubes

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.509 
there's technically no real preamp tubes
to<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> either<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> cool<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
to it either so it's kind of cool so the

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.419 
to it either so it's kind of cool so the
kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> tones<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:55.010> from<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.280> had

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
kind of tones you get from this I had

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.970 
kind of tones you get from this I had
the<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:57.050> Butler<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.230> drive<00:00:58.469> around<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.949> now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the the Butler to drive around right now

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.060 
the the Butler to drive around right now
so<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> sounds<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.679> little<00:01:01.679> bit<00:01:01.829> much

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so it sounds a little a little bit much

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.190 
so it sounds a little a little bit much
but

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.279 

Oh

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.169 

so<00:01:15.289> you<00:01:15.380> get<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.979> know<00:01:16.100> nice<00:01:16.399> saturated<00:01:16.969> tone

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
so you get you know nice saturated tone

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:27.039 
so you get you know nice saturated tone
out<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.420> it

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.429 

so<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.079> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.829> nice<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> him

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.070 

you've<00:01:32.829> heard<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.040> back<00:01:33.219> you<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.399> am<00:01:33.670> off

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:55.440 

how<00:01:38.770> does<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.010> even<00:01:39.370> switch<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.760> pick<00:01:39.910> up

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:51.030 

okay<00:01:56.450> let's<00:01:56.689> turn<00:01:57.109> this<00:01:57.609> driver<00:01:58.609> off

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.979 

I<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> nice<00:02:53.379> tone<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:55.120> know<00:02:55.269> it's

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
I like it it's a nice tone you know it's

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.020 
I like it it's a nice tone you know it's
a<00:02:56.260> good<00:02:56.500> solo<00:02:56.769> sound<00:02:57.129> it's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> good<00:02:57.700> rhythm

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
a good solo sound it's a good rhythm

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:08.590 
a good solo sound it's a good rhythm
sound

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.270 

then<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:09.930> some<00:03:10.650> heavier<00:03:10.920> stuff<00:03:11.010> with

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
then you can do some heavier stuff with

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:20.400 
then you can do some heavier stuff with
it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.400 

it's<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.500> really<00:03:21.680> really<00:03:21.860> cool<00:03:22.040> time

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.410 

I<00:03:25.440> can't<00:03:26.190> believe<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.880> sounds<00:03:27.209> as<00:03:27.270> good

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
I can't believe that it sounds as good

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.650 
I can't believe that it sounds as good
as<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.599> does<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.090> there's<00:03:30.300> no<00:03:30.420> me<00:03:30.540> up

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
as it does you know and there's no me up

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.479 
as it does you know and there's no me up
involved<00:03:31.050> at<00:03:31.170> all<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:32.010> haven't

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
involved at all with it so I haven't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.449 
involved at all with it so I haven't
done<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:34.560> Mesa<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
done with it in the the Mesa can and

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.830 
done with it in the the Mesa can and
it's<00:03:35.580> gotta<00:03:35.760> sound<00:03:35.940> cool<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.510> means<00:03:36.720> you

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
it's gotta sound cool and that means you

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:51.110 
it's gotta sound cool and that means you
won't<00:03:36.900> imagine<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:49.080> um<00:03:49.700> that's<00:03:50.700> without<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
won't imagine so um that's without the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.910 
won't imagine so um that's without the
Chandler<00:03:51.660> or<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.080> not<00:03:52.290> Chandler<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.800> be

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
Chandler or it's not Chandler to be

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:19.289 
Chandler or it's not Chandler to be
cheap<00:03:53.099> out<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.400> but

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.580 

so<00:04:20.299> that's<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.600> quick<00:04:20.750> demo<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.320> headless

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
so that's a quick demo of the headless

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.129 
so that's a quick demo of the headless
Guitar<00:04:21.920> Rig<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.490> have<00:04:23.450> any<00:04:23.570> questions<00:04:23.960> just

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
Guitar Rig and have any questions just

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.330 
Guitar Rig and have any questions just
let<00:04:24.320> me<00:04:24.380> know<00:04:24.500> I'll<00:04:25.190> probably<00:04:25.340> using<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:27.340> for

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
let me know I'll probably using this for

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.850 
let me know I'll probably using this for
some<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.669> my<00:04:28.760> lesson<00:04:29.150> videos<00:04:29.600> as<00:04:30.139> well<00:04:30.650> as

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
some of my lesson videos as well as

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.409 
some of my lesson videos as well as
hopefully<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.550> road<00:04:31.760> with<00:04:31.910> breaker<00:04:32.150> box

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
hopefully on the road with breaker box
