00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 guys speak my name is fábio lucila am 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.630
 guitarist I'm here at supper would not have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 to demonstrate the sound of the exhaust 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 malabon installed in the military is if gsp 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.199
 fashion room was also all original 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 people who come from the factory just installed 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.820
 two computers took the original 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 phone and put the campuses of Mauá 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 in case here on the bridge 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.420
 we put a super black robot not 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.190
 It's a home- from- home for the bridge and the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.379
 Arm 59 also put a value on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 black color 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.680
 It's something that draws my attention. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 in these capes is come shit in the box is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 that the headset removes ghita has been removed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 of this vitamin and in addition to bemba side a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.199
 mechanical part of the computer is screw 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.540
 on the ball and the building base of the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.090
 computer that you can mount and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.159
 install with your own hand without 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 slot this does not happen on computers 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 imported the mechanics is a bit more 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 complicated the store was cut in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 The right measure was neither age nor 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 developed in the right measure had to 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 You do not have to keep cutting the spring. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 from your computer to the guinea in the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.299
 screw the wires also comes one 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.329
 suggestion is you are looking at 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.000
 manual if it is already pre-welded and 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.920
 easy for you to dismember or not then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 time to install already has a facility 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.649
 this also suggests that you should call 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.290
 so let's talk first about the cap 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:55.950
 bridge overcomes a sound tone 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.640
 the volume is all open in tonality 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.640
 also all open 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.910
 the OPI to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 O 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.890
 next to 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.000
 the bridge has changed a bit 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.690
 now the two conjugates are not connected in the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.720
 puncture the two banks in an original way 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.540
 running and position in the middle then 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:06.220
 We accept or 4 more she expose serious cap and 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.220
 acute at the same time 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.750
 is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.500
 the clean sound are using here a peak 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.610
 so 30 computers in use for years 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 and the position of his regulation by 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.730
 It's simple because it has cement 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.760
 however everything flat is severe in an acute 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.040
 in the middle in the middle also 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.200
 now let's go to the distortion so 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.709
 distortion will use the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.709
 bridge 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.739
 the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.470
 the computer of the next 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.150
 there are two or even the same time 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.170
 nor 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
 i 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:13.780
 It's just there, it's just regulated. 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.610
 then it was done to grind all 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 all Estonian traits he was 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.990
 transiting in a house cleaning 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.740
 both an electrical part and an 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.980
 hose supply hydration regulation 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.100
 The eighth action should also be 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.100
 ropes and has its worth
