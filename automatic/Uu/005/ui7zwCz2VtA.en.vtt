00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.749
 at the omnisports palace of paris-bercy 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.349
 me the sports palace of paris-bercy 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.349
 it will once again vibrate to the rhythm of the supercross 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.539
 for its eighth edition tsx de bercy as the insiders say 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 denis not the most beautiful stadium in the world with the best American drivers 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.159
 and European 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.060
 and of course French 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.159
 for the tricolors the stakes are high 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.239
 this is the dream 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 that can come true 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.590
 their will 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.180
 three hours at the gallery 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 the same year 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.140
 French pilots present at Bercy have been appointed 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.569
 by the organizer 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.360
 this year the principle is a little different 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 those who want to the sports hall are those who are 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.690
 yes at least once on a podium in France supercross championship 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.900
 a ruthless selection system that has the merit of privileging the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 feat to regularity 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.240
 a driver who ranks 4th canton championship 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 can not participate in bercy 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.780
 the picards bella one of the best French pilots had not arrived 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.060
 until last weekend 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.800
 to get on the podium 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.260
 hapless unfortunate kervella and french soil with olive perrin have 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.220
 participated in all editions of bercy 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.439
 luckily the god of the supercross to repair this injustice kervella 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.660
 took third place in the final round 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 the doors of bercy but they are now open 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 government I can move forward 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.830
 the lights 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.990
 the Marseille club 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.600
 still impose their game 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.130
 the leader 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.660
 the season if the youngest driver package know how to win a final of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.029
 France championship 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.769
 winning the test of Grenoble he also opened the doors of 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.409
 bercy 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.409
 the dream becomes reality 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:27.419
 that's where we see the Greek debt - bernadette brian cowen government 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:34.459
 klm for the government the future for now the bianconeri but the good 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.679
 wagon joÃ«lle 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.519
 yes yes anyway 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.809
 just like wearing who had there they will be more than twenty to have 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.129
 got their ticket for bercy 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.449
 Gueddar volleyball and the others 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:49.689
 more or less secretly from an exploit 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.769
 a performance that would propel under the spotlight of bercy 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.999
 mariadb island is surely the most motivated 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.199
 by winning the two finals in turn he proved that he was in great 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.730
 form in any case decided to try to reoffend its action of brilliance of the year 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.849
 last when he had taken the lead in front of all Americans 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.650
 he reigns then is an intensity as the only personality capable of in 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.989
 get 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 moment of emotion 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.989
 when we still tremble 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.469
 and then of course 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.269
 we hope Jean-michel baylet's first victory at the Omnisports Palace 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.269
 one of the few that is missing from his list 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.519
 this year at bercy 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.609

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 displacements will be represented 125 and 250 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.579

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.129
 that the exit track in the bercy car parks 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.129
 giant screens will then allow the spectators to follow the fights 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.489
 in the basement 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.129

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.889
