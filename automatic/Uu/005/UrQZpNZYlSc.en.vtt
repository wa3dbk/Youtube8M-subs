00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.670
 and all of us from giuseppe ragazzi are not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.850
 here with 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.100
 some products different brands however 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.290
 begin to make one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 full unpacking as you see 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:29.279
 let's start from the ac 500 of pass we pass 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 at the time of fujitsu q 702 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.480
 then we have an asus branded machine 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 then we have an acer un screen 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.449
 marley sound system and a pair of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 mercat products 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.559
 let's now proceed to see what 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
 it is offered to us practically 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.729
 inside each package we are 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 in which me and luca risks now 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.339
 we will begin to see it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.049
 unpacking one product at a time 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.299
 now a short cut is then greeted e 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.500
 we begin to dedicate ourselves to a product for 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:06.420
 example let's start with the acer bus 700 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.790
 we see this strike point 5 we talk 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 of a made katz product is a high stretcher 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.020
 gaming proceeds directly to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.960
 unpacking so as and when 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.600
 we open the product we also see of 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.939
 tell you the point we start let's talk 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.859
 at the big assembly it allows us practice 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.689
 to have assembly instructions 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.969
 because the keyboard in question is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 modular 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.880
 let's see then keyboard layout 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 we believe the central body then 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 We only alphabetic keyboard 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.090
 practice is at hand door and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.310
 beds as regards the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.960
 usb connection we then have the frames 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.340
 lower age in metal than there 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.880
 allow in practice is also 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.880
 vaio accessories 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.860
 let us therefore proceed with what must 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.369
 be the draft orbene the keypad 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.229
 directional arrows and the keypad as well 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.640
 to be able to hook it or not in base 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.610
 obviously your needs 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.960
 with legs apart decidedly 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.750
 interesting in this case comes a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:18.810
 pair of usd posed connections 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:20.730
 later we have then the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.860
 dispenser regarding the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.530
 presence information is find 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 the status and elimination of any 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.489
 microphone management with the eventual 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 management options with paul and mint instead 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.880
 wired connections located in the part 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.190
 top as you see and over a couple e 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.290
 of back connection so it is so 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.120
 being able to keep everything with a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 precisely ordered layout further queen 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.510
 mini usb ok we have other enters one 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.480
 however, note the excellent 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.459
 internal protection to believe 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 note the thickness of the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.060
 internal protection so if you proceed 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.379
 for example, even when buying online 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 find it all in protected form 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.060
 here we will find the instructions missing but 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.099
 also in this case the possible disc 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.900
 we have the support that allows in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:23.609
 practice of having paul si support 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:28.230
 presents we have function keys like 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.700
 we hold four end I saw 464 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.379
 we therefore have four functions 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.609
 customizable invaded mind turned 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:40.040
 need this thanks to free 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.690
 support 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.549
 we have a pair of wrist rests and there 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.549
 it allows in practice to have the support 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.610
 for the central area and the area in this 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.010
 case I would say right side 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.500
 Good evening the left and now this is a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.130
 however little whipped mounted on this 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.700
 case it would be curious I would say bilateral 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.280
 right 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.990
 standing the figure and we are going into 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.180
 this case we are based then 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.180
 I would say lateral right there is nothing else 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:18.800
 then we finally find the neighbors of course 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:22.790
 can observe related schiavina a 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.310
 3 or so allen key or two similar things 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.950
 then with the various PCs it allows then to 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.720
 mount in all with good ease 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.580
 as for the product, it is not there 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.230
 other in this case to show you a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.480
 very short there will be a gallery 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.640
 photo after which obviously 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.390
 we will be working in everything for 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.430
 as for unpacking 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.830
 so i'd say we can trust her like that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.270
 of greets and thanks for the attention 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.830
