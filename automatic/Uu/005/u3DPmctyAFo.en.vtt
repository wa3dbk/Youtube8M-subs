00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.730 
would like to talk about high hats but
not<00:00:20.690> as<00:00:20.930> single<00:00:21.500> sounds<00:00:22.130> but<00:00:22.550> hi<00:00:22.880> had<00:00:23.150> chains

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
not as single sounds but hi had chains

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.630 
not as single sounds but hi had chains
combinations<00:00:24.740> like<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:31.070> I'd<00:00:31.340> like<00:00:31.580> to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
combinations like this so I'd like to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.389 
combinations like this so I'd like to
show<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:32.029> how<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.629> string<00:00:33.109> together<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.920> high

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
show you how to string together the high

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.540 
show you how to string together the high
hat<00:00:34.640> sounds<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.719> cohesive<00:00:36.530> line<00:00:36.769> so<00:00:37.339> let's

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
hat sounds to a cohesive line so let's

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.689 
hat sounds to a cohesive line so let's
take<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:37.819> look<00:00:38.059> at<00:00:38.179> this<00:00:38.329> one<00:00:39.069> here<00:00:40.069> you<00:00:40.249> can<00:00:40.280> see

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
take a look at this one here you can see

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.049 
take a look at this one here you can see
that<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.469> sixteenth<00:00:43.249> notes<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.850> you've

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
that this is sixteenth notes and you've

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.930 
that this is sixteenth notes and you've
got<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.239> lot<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.659> T<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.530> K<00:00:45.859> and<00:00:46.129> T<00:00:46.339> in<00:00:46.519> cases

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
got a lot of T and K and T in cases

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.090 
got a lot of T and K and T in cases
ticka<00:00:47.300> ticka<00:00:47.329> ticka<00:00:47.569> ticka<00:00:47.839> T<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.440> if<00:00:48.799> you<00:00:48.949> add

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
ticka ticka ticka ticka T and if you add

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.979 
ticka ticka ticka ticka T and if you add
the<00:00:49.339> S<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:52.210> now<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.269> thing<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.749> have<00:00:53.780> to

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the S it's now the thing is you have to

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.099 
the S it's now the thing is you have to
breathe<00:00:54.469> at<00:00:54.710> some<00:00:55.010> point<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.510> solution<00:00:57.019> is

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
breathe at some point so the solution is

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.779 
breathe at some point so the solution is
either<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.799> breathe<00:00:58.069> in<00:00:58.280> water<00:01:00.190> or<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.609> just

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
either you breathe in water or you just

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.270 
either you breathe in water or you just
leave<00:01:02.089> out<00:01:02.389> a<00:01:02.839> sound<00:01:03.139> and<00:01:03.499> instead<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:04.070> doing

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
leave out a sound and instead of doing

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.380 
leave out a sound and instead of doing
the<00:01:04.369> sound<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.790> breathe<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:10.910> allows<00:01:11.180> you

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
the sound you breathe so this allows you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.980 
the sound you breathe so this allows you
to<00:01:11.600> carry<00:01:11.870> on<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.710> sounds<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.550> cycle<00:01:13.990> now

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
to carry on the sounds in a cycle now

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.770 
to carry on the sounds in a cycle now
you<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.650> also<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:16.190> different<00:01:16.880> accents<00:01:17.540> on

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
you can also have different accents on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.540 
you can also have different accents on
the<00:01:18.140> sounds<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.800> this<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.100> something<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.400> I

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
the sounds and this is something that I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.250 
the sounds and this is something that I
would<00:01:19.670> like<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.820> show<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.180> with<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.870> example

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
would like to show you with this example

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.660 
would like to show you with this example
because<00:01:21.500> we've<00:01:21.770> actually<00:01:21.980> written<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.640> down

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
because we've actually written that down

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.130 
because we've actually written that down
so<00:01:23.540> we<00:01:23.720> have<00:01:23.960> X<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.280> number<00:01:25.580> one<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
so we have X in the number one is the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.560 
so we have X in the number one is the
following<00:01:27.410> pattern<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.910> can<00:01:32.120> hear<00:01:32.450> I'm

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
following pattern so you can hear I'm

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.170 
following pattern so you can hear I'm
always<00:01:32.870> stressing<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.920> first<00:01:34.220> sound<00:01:36.970> one<00:01:37.970> two

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
always stressing the first sound one two

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.570 
always stressing the first sound one two
three<00:01:38.450> four<00:01:38.690> one<00:01:38.900> two<00:01:38.960> three<00:01:39.380> now<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.950> same<00:01:40.310> is

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
three four one two three now the same is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.300 
three four one two three now the same is
possible<00:01:41.540> for<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.140> second<00:01:42.560> sound<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.220> it

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
possible for the second sound so it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.580 
possible for the second sound so it
would<00:01:43.430> be<00:01:46.780> two<00:01:47.780> three<00:01:47.930> four<00:01:48.200> one<00:01:48.350> two<00:01:48.500> three

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
would be two three four one two three

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.950 
would be two three four one two three
four<00:01:48.830> it's<00:01:49.070> always<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.520> two<00:01:49.730> then<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.750> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
four it's always on the two then on the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.430 
four it's always on the two then on the
third<00:01:51.170> sound<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:58.180> finally<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.720> fourth<00:02:00.080> sound

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
third sound and finally the fourth sound

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.199 
third sound and finally the fourth sound
which<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:07.070> has<00:02:07.130> more<00:02:07.790> kind<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.119> a

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
which is and this has more kind of a

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.759 
which is and this has more kind of a
Latin<00:02:08.569> feel<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:11.150> depending<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:11.959> where<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:12.530> put

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
Latin feel so depending on where you put

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.610 
Latin feel so depending on where you put
the<00:02:12.920> accent

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the accent

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.220 
the accent
on<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.280> hi-hat<00:02:14.489> sound<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.750> different

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
on the hi-hat sound you get different

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
on the hi-hat sound you get different
musical<00:02:16.950> styles<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.940> play<00:02:18.180> around<00:02:18.300> with<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
musical styles so play around with it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.860 
musical styles so play around with it
it's<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.530> fun<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.360> takes<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.480> lot<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.629> time

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it's really fun and takes a lot of time

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's really fun and takes a lot of time
but<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.379> worth<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> promise
