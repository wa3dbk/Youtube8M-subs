 something of which I believe that the majority 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 I was already anxious, something that I do not know 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 I knew absolutely nothing at all anymore 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.119
 they talked about this but more however 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.100
 no dates were known, it was not known 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 just in this video I will talk to you about 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 little about the details about 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 the new things that will contain us 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 this dlc but guys before starting 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.590
 I would like to remind you that what 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 is the launch of this new dlc it 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.739
 just released a trailer a troll no 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.270
 official by plants against 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 zombies in which you can obviously 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 observe a few bits of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 gameplay first impressions about 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 what is the new content and such more 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.969
 however guys said gameplay or I've 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 said bring I can not put it in this 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.120
 same video for obvious reasons 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.590
 so right here it goes with the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.329
 description I'll leave you what is the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.559
 official link of the plant channel against 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.359
 zombies so you can go for a spin 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.070
 can you know what the trailer is in 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 it's really fun they give us 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 know many details 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 it makes us give us many more 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 I want this to come practically 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 already because even so despite all this 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 we are already very close some 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.550
 more hours we will have it available 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.020
 well as they listen to you so we 're going to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.369
 start guys obviously first that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.590
 nothing what would be the name of this new 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.380
 dlc the name of the l would take what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.119
 it's high tactic like barry pack which 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.160
 it's really going 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 really super super excited the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.240
 what will be a totally free dlc 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 as it has previous sale 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
 said dl is going to contain enough 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.390
 very novel things starting with what 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.160
 that would be a new map a new map the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 which will bear the name of google 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.630
 johnson leaves which is oriented to what 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.940
 that is the old this some mines in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 which extracted jewelry were the types 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.740
 of colored crystals in which the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.780
 doctor are bosc because he is extracting the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.940
 not so practically the plants are going 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.830
 to get to this place in order not to 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
 I know of hitting him right in his 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.369
 wallet so it's really a map 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.960
 quite funny very dynamic 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729
 especially the characteristic arrives 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.800
 principal of said map this one just 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.360
 through the center it goes through what are some 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.340
 train tracks in which obviously 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.260
 They will be running along d 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.879
 the games so that really gives you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.800
 a special touch gives a lot of touch 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.629
 more dynamic to what we already know in a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.980
 map of plants against zombies so 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.200
 guys would be the first thing that we 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.510
 would contain a new map which already 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.099
 we mention now on this same map 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.200
 to be able to play what are the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.390
 modalities of adopting by teams what 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.940
 which is also garden operations 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.680
 what is pump gnome and what would be the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.080
 new game mode that is also 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 will add tomorrow and we are 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.080
 talking about a new modality guys 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.730
 which would be the following things that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.790
 the new modality would be added 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.440
 call banking confirm sale which 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.329
 would be the most similar to put a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.860
 example to what would be confirmed low 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.569
 in call of duty your that most 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.370
 we have ever known that 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.959
 modality we have played the call of duty and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.519
 we know what we are talking about this 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.500
 modality the most similar to this comes out 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.930
 consists of a guy defeating by teams 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.540
 which its main characteristic is 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.239
 that we must pick up what would be the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.730
 doctor or the card that will leave the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.010
 enemies at the moment they are killed 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.870
 for any of us really kill 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.760
 one of the enemies is going to leave what is 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.130
 in this case they will call crazy or 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.290
 they are going to leave what is a crisis 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.360
 we must pick up to write down what 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.490
 which is a point in what is the marker 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.900
 what is the game is worth if in case 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
 that you do not pick them up if you pick them up 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.740
 one of his colleagues obviously the 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.750
 point is going to cancel basically a 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.280
 modality already well known in others 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.230
 games as I already told you especially 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.300
 every dury that really give him a point 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.070
 quite special a touch much more 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.080
 competitive to this modality within 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.730
 this wonderful game so that would be the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.740
 second thing that would also segregate 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.450
 we have what is a new square of 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.760
 circulates new playlist of 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.530
 game is added what is the mode 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.090
 mixed eight versus eight in which they go 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.580
 to include all modalities already 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.650
 mentioned previously goes out separately 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.720
 of all this two characters will be added 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.270
 new characters which have been 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.460
 presented by aquafina flavor splash 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.280
 a brand which is dedicated to what 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.650
 are the production of ale ale to waters 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.060
 and all that matter so on the part of 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.460
 they have become the characters 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.500
 inspired by certain or you could say 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.120
 that in a certain way in some fruits 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.940
 the first one is going to be a 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.130
 tantrum which is a pea which 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.530
 his description tells us that this is 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 Beautiful blue berry can cause harm 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.800
 strange with a minor 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.050
 perfect rate of fire to beat 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.490
 the enemies too evasive and 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 we also have what citrus is 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.780
 cactus this orange cactus covered 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.730
 of segments can fire a burst of 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.590
 three rounds and beat your enemies with 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.720
 a precision shot of a single line 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.340
 perfectly synchronized so 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.750
 guys there they have it with this from the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.160
 characters are also added some 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.110
 how many characteristics with those of 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.910
 personalization and all that in a way 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.130
 that the album of stickers is still 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.540
 growing and continues to grow at that 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.760

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.320
