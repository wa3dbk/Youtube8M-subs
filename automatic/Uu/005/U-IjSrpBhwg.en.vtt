00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:26.740 
the one side they're gonna be really
caramelized<00:02:14.340> jars

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.490 

apart

apart

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.090 
apart
that<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.950> use<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.660> set<00:02:30.660> ground<00:02:31.100> sirloin

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
that when you use a set ground sirloin

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.190 
that when you use a set ground sirloin
runs<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.820> here<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.270> those<00:02:33.420> haven't<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.960> lot

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
runs in here but those haven't got a lot

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200 
runs in here but those haven't got a lot
leaner<00:02:34.500> fat<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.190> let's<00:02:35.520> put<00:02:35.670> together<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
leaner fat but let's put together that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.000 
leaner fat but let's put together that
okay<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.410> once<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:37.890> the

okay so we good once you get all the
gravy<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> ocean

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
gravy and ocean

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
gravy and ocean
turn<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> heat<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.310> little<00:02:41.340> bit<00:02:41.790> it's

a platter you want to just cover them up
with<00:03:07.680> foil<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.959> next<00:03:16.170> thing<00:03:16.320> we're

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
with foil so that the next thing we're

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.010 
with foil so that the next thing we're
gonna<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.950> add<00:03:17.370> mushrooms<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.959> to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020

take about 12 mushrooms and you want to
use<00:03:21.870> two<00:03:22.170> different<00:03:22.560> kinds<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:23.130> we<00:03:23.550> usually

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
use two different kinds now we usually

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.540 
use two different kinds now we usually
use<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.720> plain<00:03:25.440> white<00:03:25.770> little<00:03:26.250> button

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
use just the plain white little button

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.090 
use just the plain white little button
mushrooms<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.239> then<00:03:27.720> creamy<00:03:28.230> knees<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.980> you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
mushrooms and then creamy knees but you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.150 
mushrooms and then creamy knees but you
could<00:03:29.280> also<00:03:29.459> use<00:03:29.959> shiitakes<00:03:30.959> or<00:03:31.410> portabellos

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
could also use shiitakes or portabellos

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160 
could also use shiitakes or portabellos
now<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:32.910> they're<00:03:33.000> getting<00:03:33.270> portobellos<00:03:33.870> don't

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
now if they're getting portobellos don't

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.420 
now if they're getting portobellos don't
use<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> big<00:03:34.650> ones<00:03:34.830> or<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.100> you're<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.310> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
use the big ones or if you're going to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220 
use the big ones or if you're going to
use<00:03:35.640> those<00:03:36.239> big<00:03:36.480> ones<00:03:36.690> you're<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.140> have

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
use those big ones you're going to have

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.670 
use those big ones you're going to have
to<00:03:37.350> cut<00:03:37.560> them<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.070> bit<00:03:38.310> more<00:03:38.610> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
to cut them up a little bit more and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600 
to cut them up a little bit more and
obviously<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.739> don't<00:03:40.860> need<00:03:41.040> twelve<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.459> them

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
obviously you don't need twelve of them

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.310 
obviously you don't need twelve of them
because<00:03:41.910> they're<00:03:42.090> large<00:03:42.330> mushrooms<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.080> you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
because they're large mushrooms so you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.190 
because they're large mushrooms so you
want<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.890> cut<00:03:44.100> these<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.489> up<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.880> about

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
want to cut these all up and about

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.370 
want to cut these all up and about
quarter<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.470> half<00:03:47.400> inch<00:03:47.700> slices<00:03:48.269> make<00:03:49.170> them

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
quarter to a half inch slices make them

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.490 
quarter to a half inch slices make them
so<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.739> they're<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.070> about<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.489> same<00:03:50.519> size

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
so that they're all about the same size

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.050 
so that they're all about the same size
one<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.709> things<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.220> when<00:03:53.519> you're<00:03:53.700> before

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
one of the things to when you're before

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.390 
one of the things to when you're before
where<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.019> clean<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.440> mushrooms<00:03:55.620> my

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
where you have to clean the mushrooms my

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.830 
where you have to clean the mushrooms my
mom<00:03:56.610> always<00:03:56.850> taught<00:03:57.209> me<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.420> when<00:03:57.750> you're

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
mom always taught me that when you're

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.390 
mom always taught me that when you're
cleaning<00:03:58.140> mushrooms<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.799> never<00:03:59.010> put<00:03:59.280> them

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
cleaning mushrooms you never put them

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.330 
cleaning mushrooms you never put them
under<00:03:59.820> water<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> bruises<00:04:01.530> them<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.890> two

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
under water one it bruises them and two

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.960 
under water one it bruises them and two
mushrooms<00:04:02.820> are<00:04:03.000> very<00:04:03.030> porous<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.130> they

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
mushrooms are very porous so and they

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.670 
mushrooms are very porous so and they
also<00:04:06.000> will<00:04:06.480> retain<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.049> water<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.530> don't

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
also will retain the water and you don't

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.710 
also will retain the water and you don't
