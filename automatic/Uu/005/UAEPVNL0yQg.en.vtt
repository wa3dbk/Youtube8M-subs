00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Although the bramberg everything was one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.720
 real cup fight makes you feel like a guy 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.929
 fight and after 120 minutes had before 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.670
 all won the better but before the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 meritorious wages stood in the truest sense 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.609
 of the word hard bone work 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.500
 because the bundesligist out 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 Mönchengladbach wanted the playful 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
 Inferiority through nervousness 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.350
 balance so-called healthy hardness 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 Here lays igor images on more of these 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 capitano rich costner and groninger 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.179
 the others were suffering 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179
 gruff gangue 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.610
 but the ofc was not in any phase of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 play by these opponents to impress 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.469
 from the beginning it was clear who therefore 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 bieberer berg was a groninger with one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.629
 huge possibility already after five 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.489
 minutes 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.809
 wolf werner had hoped that his 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 team up against the top division 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 could play out of the crisis 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 but the offenbacher actually as 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.550
 amateurs planned professionals were the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 superior team 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.789
 Maybe Peter is the one for that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.079
 cold-blooded and already after one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.079
 to lead in quarter of an hour 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.229
 the table last of the Bundesliga knew 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.399
 not where to go with the ball that was already 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.399
 really helpless 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 then probably more of a fix 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 by jörg neunaber bernd am at 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 that cup evening flawless the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820
 Oberligist gave the Bundesliga 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.680
 tutoring with courage and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 Self-confidence can be such a game 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.900
 raise and got and the best 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 gladbacher risked on head and collar 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530
 his team from the backlog too 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.520
 save 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.930
 Stefan Schwummer had millions 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 shopping about bella still completely 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.120
 very rarely deregistered that europe 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.660
 footballer of the year 1986 once so 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.920
 dangerous shot came again not 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 so well played by his fellow players 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.000
 or what the deletion or played around 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 We also have the rooms fast 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.920
 us against too long a draw 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.750
 We can distribute 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.190
 spectators behind us maybe something else 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.390
 was 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.740
 after the page change the tried 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.690
 Borussia to pick up the book 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.640
 but the storm turned out to be 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.940
 fast asleep rarely had the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 gladbacher such a good scene 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.130
 liquid combinations at 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.459
 Table Leader of the Oberliga Hesse 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.450
 capitano like ciao vw clear but the ex 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.920
 profi lays the ball too far ahead 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.900
 the gladbacher bank beat themselves 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.820
 carer hands before the still eyes 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.110
 quite unknown the undecided 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.160
 borussen could on one 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 hope to repeat game 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:50.850
 but then it was the regular game time 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.410
 over and they were looking for the one meter 88 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.150
 long ruby in the storm center the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.140
 gladbacher always fearful beat 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 but the ball into the toraus up to 98 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.740
 minutes could the battered 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.180
 would be federal leagues in this way 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.230
 but then he told me capitano 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.230
 made the golden gate 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 make the move to the next round 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.080
 this hit a lot of money in the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 empty offenbacher classes and on top of that 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.560
 there was still a big praise from gladbachs 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.150
 trainer wolf likes the after this 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.510
 defeat but probably soon the way to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.700
 employment has to go firstly 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440
 the fact that apparently to bomb 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.180
 football game has offered and with a 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.740
 has fought the passion 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.900
 is exemplary and is located on the other 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.140
 It is because we are not in a position 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.310
 from 23 meters to the gate 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.170
 however, Libya had round borchers 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 also his defense had been well organized 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.440
 Asked for his gate answers 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.720
 amateur capitano sees it all 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.989
 professionally presented video pro league 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.370
 every goal is play is especially dear to him 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.660
 the gates against higher class 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.310
 crews nico they laugh tell me 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.230
 capitano witsch made sure that 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.650
 the second federal league after today 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.810
 thrown out of the dfb cup 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.470
 he's one of I'll say four 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.480
 alien capital adamovich door is the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.980
 poles features the greeks in the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.390
 bundesliga are allowed to play two foreigners 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180
 is not that a distortion of competition 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.640
 since I have punished my enough 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.260
 dfb that we added an amateur league 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.810
 have been and I think that 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.180
 the amateur would be entitled to this right 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.710
 so it is clear in the amateur in the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.220
 amateur time allowed as much outside the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.630
 play as the team would like to have 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.040
 let's come to another player 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.590
 your team we just saw 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.300
 have stefan's schummer I'd say 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.460
 a bit disrespectful one 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.350
 greenhorn has against a world class man 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.310
 what have you played in the stefan before 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.160
 with on the way given 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.930
 from the stefan gloom has in the first 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.669
 Cup play against Uerdingen already against 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.320
 the loud played yes no 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.380
 unknown but very good grip 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.830
 had and would be switched off according to the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.450
 I have the stefan schumacher and 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.580
 the la bella still off 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.190
 hand on the heart who should the power of 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.140
 is obviously far from undermining 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.120
 borussia monchengladbach at the moment 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.450
 at all a team with bundesliga 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.820
 format of the potential I must say 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.640
 Gladbach still has a team 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.060
 in the first league among the first 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.380
 but eight have to play why in football 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.970
 only something is wrong 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.920
 in this team or in the whole 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.360
 environment and that's why they do 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.770
 hard at the moment and they are too 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.600
 bit unsettled because if you 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.160
 six games in the first league 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.980
 one loses in a row then one has 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.150
 Also seen last night that way 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.430
 a little self-confidence 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.980
 what do you have at wolf werner? 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.930
 Coach colleagues said after the game 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.640
 only little is talked about the game 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.590
 He congratulated me and he did too 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.630
 a press conference clearly and clearly 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.270
 to express that he is from 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.770
 the obvious was deserved 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.810
 yes if they are in the comparable 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.130
 situation would be in offenbach like wolf 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.950
 werner in gladbach they would still be 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.270
 I can coach him from here 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.530
 do not answer because they have to mean 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.000
 presidential plan but it sees 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.070
 security in apparently a little more difficult 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.980
 from vienna makes believe he will be on 11 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.480
 or would you draw the consequences 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.280
 no I do not think so you have to 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.640
 defeat coach and that 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.290
 means whether one stands for the misere 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.670
 yourself or the cables themselves 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.010
 search out 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.110
 as a game like last night costs 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.120
 a lot of nerve power they have on 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.770
 last weekend in battenberg at 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.590
 tables-then table last of the 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.290
 Oberliga apartment lost which game 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.900
 costa no longer annoying if I mean 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.040
 so pokal play like against gladbach can 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.860
 not with a championship game 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.110
 in battenberg compare with security 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.510
 you go just as tense in the 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.910
 against battenberg but after one 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.100
 certain time then you realize that there 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.840
 there was nothing left to bring in 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.820
 battenberg and then you have this game 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.150
 from gladbach was another situation 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.580
 we have the normal playing time with 1 0 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.740
 finished and are then in the 98th 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.390
 minute 1 0 started and from 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.940
 At this time you have already 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.040
 20 minutes the very very exhausting 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.890
 are and you still notice today 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.590
 my vote is the next opponent msv 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.030
 duisburg three games to the cup victory 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.140
 in berlin i mean the offenbacher 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.610
 would actually turn again or 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:20.380
 what is easier on those against the 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:22.120
 second league and now the rise is with 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.980
 safety not easy but ins 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.360
 to come to my final cup is, I believe 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.490
 even a little harder because if you 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.380
 then you have to go to the cup final 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.240
 most of the time with Erstliga 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.710
 teams do the against the story 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.340
 a bit heavier like an amateur league 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.350
 to pass 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.720
 Technically, thanks for the short 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.000
 I can talk to you 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.830
 the record give the the 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.650
 sporthilfe three market 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.900
 if you therefore buys the title and 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.400
 some groups on it we win this one 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.260
 plate maxi motivate but open 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.840
 offenbach is not as running as at the moment 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.840
 Thank you very much and how
