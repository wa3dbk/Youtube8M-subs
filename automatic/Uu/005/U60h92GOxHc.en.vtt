blade<00:01:38.450> Pro<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:39.380> compared<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:41.349> 256

blade Pro we compared this to the 256
gigabyte<00:01:42.890> version<00:01:43.390> because<00:01:44.390> 2m<00:01:45.020> Sada's<00:01:45.530> is

gigabyte version because 2m Sada's is
256<00:01:46.550> gigabytes<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.420> feel<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.780> those<00:01:47.899> are

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
256 gigabytes so we feel that those are

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.770 
256 gigabytes so we feel that those are

them into one port going over the size
here<00:02:36.609> in<00:02:37.609> my<00:02:37.909> opinion<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.900> gs70<00:02:39.799> stealth<00:02:40.129> is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
here in my opinion the gs70 stealth is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.179 
here in my opinion the gs70 stealth is
actually<00:02:40.730> slightly<00:02:41.090> smaller<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:42.769> smaller

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
actually slightly smaller it's smaller

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.660 
actually slightly smaller it's smaller
in<00:02:43.430> length<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.239> height<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:45.200> barely<00:02:45.670> it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
in length and in height just barely it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
in length and in height just barely it
is<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> little<00:02:47.390> bit<00:02:47.599> deeper<00:02:47.870> though<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.650> razor

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
is a little bit deeper though the razor

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.949 
is a little bit deeper though the razor
blade<00:02:49.129> Pro<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.640> ten<00:02:49.939> point<00:02:50.180> nine<00:02:50.239> inches<00:02:50.689> deep

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
blade Pro is ten point nine inches deep

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.099 
blade Pro is ten point nine inches deep
and<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.069> gs70<00:02:52.849> stealth<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.480> eleven

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109

those<00:04:26.810> for<00:04:27.080> you

going<00:04:27.860> down<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.099> system<00:04:28.280> specs<00:04:28.759> sometimes

going down the system specs sometimes

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.249 
going down the system specs sometimes
it's<00:04:29.479> hard<00:04:29.979> comparing<00:04:31.630> systems<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:33.110> are

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
it's hard comparing systems that are

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.460 
it's hard comparing systems that are
very<00:04:33.490> equal<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.639> size<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.479> features<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.289> one

so hopefully this comparison just gave

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.209 
so hopefully this comparison just gave
you<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.880> know<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.270> different<00:04:41.950> perception<00:04:42.950> on

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
you a you know a different perception on
