 and did not enter 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.349
 in the recovery part of windows and me 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.140
 need to get into windows recovery 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:40.540
 because my friend forgot the password 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.390

 appears the recovery option for the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:08.019
 windows have already changed all the options here and 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:12.250
 none gave me the option to enter 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:15.510
 bus recovery match 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.010
 the only screen the only key to the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.799
 pressing that there will be some 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.650
 thing is the f4 key 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.889
 the start and we will do here just 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.790
 here we are here to go out and 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.790
 save not right 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:39.790
 pressing f4 is not starting goes 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.949
 to enter this screen has nothing else only this 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.479
 exit or turn off the power button 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:51.849
 or against the high control of dell 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:52.709
 I already enter the windows part and so 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.919

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.250
 appliance
