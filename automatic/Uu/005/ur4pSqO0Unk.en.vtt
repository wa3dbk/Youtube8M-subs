the dash and we're going to do vanilla
extract<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.909> about<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.780> quarter

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
extract I to about a quarter

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.440 
extract I to about a quarter
spoon<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.000> um<00:02:10.539> oh<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.670> about<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.090> right

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
spoon but um oh that's about it right

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.289 
spoon but um oh that's about it right
there<00:02:14.250> we're<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> couple<00:02:16.120> dashes

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
there we're going to do a couple dashes

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.670 
there we're going to do a couple dashes
of<00:02:17.340> mineral<00:02:18.340> salt<00:02:18.580> oh<00:02:18.909> you'll<00:02:19.659> pick<00:02:20.260> up<00:02:20.440> all

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
of mineral salt oh you'll pick up all

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.210 
of mineral salt oh you'll pick up all
the<00:02:20.830> flavor<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.489> it'll<00:02:22.239> just<00:02:22.560> make<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.620> pop<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the flavor so it'll just make it pop I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.789 
the flavor so it'll just make it pop I
guess<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> best<00:02:24.730> way<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> say<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.799> there

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
guess is the best way to say it so there

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.100 
guess is the best way to say it so there
we<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.180> we're<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> little<00:02:28.629> coconut

if you do want to put a little coconut

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.720 
if you do want to put a little coconut
oil<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:35.260> as<00:02:35.590> good<00:02:35.829> it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
oil that that would be just as good it's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.160 
oil that that would be just as good it's
also<00:02:36.909> going<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.299> add<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> little<00:02:37.569> bit<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.959> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
also going to add a little bit of a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.970 
also going to add a little bit of a
creamy<00:02:38.670> flavor<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.769> personally<00:02:41.769> love

about a tablespoon we're almost there so
we<00:02:57.459> have<00:02:57.700> our<00:02:57.730> good<00:02:58.209> fats<00:02:58.540> we<00:02:58.959> have<00:02:59.049> some

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
we have our good fats we have some

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.410 
we have our good fats we have some
protein<00:03:00.129> from<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> nest<00:03:01.030> we're<00:03:01.180> going<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.359> do

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
protein from the nest we're going to do

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
protein from the nest we're going to do
a<00:03:01.450> little<00:03:01.720> bit<00:03:01.930> more<00:03:02.049> protein<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
a little bit more protein this is the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.580 
a little bit more protein this is the
rice<00:03:05.950> grand<00:03:06.370> protein<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.480> very<00:03:08.109> easy<00:03:08.409> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
rice grand protein and it's very easy to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.119 
rice grand protein and it's very easy to
digest<00:03:09.390> purse<00:03:10.390> or<00:03:10.629> beans<00:03:10.810> about<00:03:11.049> 12<00:03:11.530> grams<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.620 
digest purse or beans about 12 grams of
protein<00:03:12.310> 1<00:03:12.790> gram<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.530> carbohydrate<00:03:14.669> so<00:03:15.669> I'm

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
protein 1 gram of carbohydrate so I'm

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.800 
protein 1 gram of carbohydrate so I'm
going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.410> good<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.400> table<00:03:19.389> civil

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
going to do a good little table civil

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.599 
going to do a good little table civil
here<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:23.319> sweetener<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:24.069> mean<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.459> could

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.250 
this one or you could use the maple
syrup<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> have<00:03:32.230> four<00:03:32.590> dates<00:03:32.889> here<00:03:34.260> drop

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
syrup so I have four dates here drop

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.110 
syrup so I have four dates here drop
those<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.739> I'm<00:03:36.129> gonna<00:03:36.280> add<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:36.760> bit

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
those in I'm gonna add just a little bit

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.789 
those in I'm gonna add just a little bit
of<00:03:37.510> stevia<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:39.280> particular<00:03:39.430> stevia<00:03:40.299> is

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
of stevia and this particular stevia is

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.050 
of stevia and this particular stevia is
just<00:03:41.799> basically<00:03:42.459> what<00:03:42.669> they<00:03:42.790> did<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.030> they

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
just basically what they did is they

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.869 
just basically what they did is they
took<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.690> leaf<00:03:44.139> they<00:03:44.980> ground<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> up<00:03:45.609> and

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
took the leaf they ground it up and

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.569 
took the leaf they ground it up and
dehydrated<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.349> it's<00:03:48.040> actually<00:03:48.519> a

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
dehydrated it and so it's actually a

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.650 
dehydrated it and so it's actually a
green<00:03:49.030> color<00:03:49.419> and<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.769> like<00:03:51.099> that<00:03:51.129> because<00:03:51.699> it's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
green color and I like that because it's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.909 
green color and I like that because it's
the<00:03:52.930> most<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:55.180> most<00:03:55.209> whole<00:03:55.660> form<00:03:56.169> of<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
the most the most whole form of the

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.180 
the most the most whole form of the
stevia<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.329> it's<00:03:59.260> still<00:03:59.620> very<00:03:59.949> very

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
stevia so it's it's still very very

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.210 
stevia so it's it's still very very
potent<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.599> only<00:04:01.810> need<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.109> little<00:04:02.169> bit<00:04:02.440> and

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
potent so you only need a little bit and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.319 
potent so you only need a little bit and
that's<00:04:03.519> way<00:04:03.730> too<00:04:03.790> much<00:04:04.120> actually<00:04:06.269> add<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
that's way too much actually add a

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:14.189 
that's way too much actually add a
little<00:04:07.780> kick<00:04:09.660> sweetness<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:13.359> I<00:04:13.780> had<00:04:13.989> already

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
little kick sweetness and I had already

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.930 
little kick sweetness and I had already
put<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.919> water<00:04:15.519> about<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:16.239> cup<00:04:16.510> too

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
put a water about a cup too

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.840 
put a water about a cup too
a<00:04:16.970> half<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.540> water<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.170> blender<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.950> ice

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
a half of water in the blender and ice

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
a half of water in the blender and ice
and<00:04:25.030> we<00:04:26.030> are<00:04:26.330> ready<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.170> blend<00:04:28.240> got<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.510> all<00:04:29.690> in

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
and we are ready to blend got it all in

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.000
