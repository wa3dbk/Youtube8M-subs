00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.900
 we take our three leaves of family 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.870
 in different color and we will draw and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.090
 cut a foami strip of 1.5 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.900
 centimeters by the length of the sheet 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.900
 each color 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.610
 In total we must have three strips of 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.190
 different color of 1.5 centimeters per 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.590

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.140
 a stretch of 5 centimeters 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 approximately 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.310

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.560
 we join the ribbon from end to end 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.940
 ribbon at the tips of the spiral 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.470

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.470

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.210

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.400
 we put a drop of film with liquid 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.740
 on the head of the pin and the ribbon 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.740
 to prevent it from peeling off or breaking 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.850
 the ribbon on the bottom of the 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.090
