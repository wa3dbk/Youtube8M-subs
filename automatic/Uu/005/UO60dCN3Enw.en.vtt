I think and just kind of shows the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
I think and just kind of shows the
possibilities<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.220> could<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.729> having

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
possibilities of what we could be having

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
possibilities of what we could be having
if<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:28.110> example<00:01:28.140> rockster<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.250> wanted

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
if for example rockster I really wanted

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
if for example rockster I really wanted

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to give us something like this imagine

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
to give us something like this imagine
what<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> billion-dollar<00:01:32.040> company<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.700> do

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
what a billion-dollar company could do

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
what a billion-dollar company could do
and<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.040> know

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and it would really just make you know

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
and it would really just make you know
just<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.700> online<00:01:36.150> feature<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.710> better
