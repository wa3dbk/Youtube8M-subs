 psychologists of our sessions now 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 wants it to be proven that the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
 Latin countries mainly the

 because laughter and smiling are things 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.310
 different 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.140
 of expression of joy and laughter goes 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 to come from our belly because it 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 they will counteract several muscles of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.240
 our from our stomach and we're going to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 Exactly extract more than 400 muscles we are going to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 start to move and we will take it out 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 through the mouth is with the cast 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 then the laughter and the smile 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 only going to be the facial expression 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.039
 we are going to curve our mouth on how 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 meaning of then joy of being 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.209

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.700
 difference between laughter and smiles and 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.409
 accounts pulls me fraga I do not remember those 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.659
 moments that for anything or 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.640
 any minimal nonsense the best that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.590
 you laugh for that is that it hurts you are in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.330
 been good you can stop laughing and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 also sometimes it's contagious 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 being someone laugh or smile and you 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 That's parent because it helps you too 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.789
 you have in your body it also helps you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.530
 Remove your stress then every time 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 much 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.940
 hormones why then after all 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 this release we find a moment 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 of relaxation let's release hormones 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.630
 one of the fundamental hormones that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.630
 happiness 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.820
 the endorphin is the final traitor and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.740
 we are also going to release hormones like 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.020
 serotonin dopamine 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.280

 energy makes us be creative to have 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.580
 a lot of imagination that's why when 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.710
 we enter this operation 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.660
 of our muscles that we move all 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.580

 as in the digestive system because it 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.790
 they are going to antagonize all those organs that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.190
 sea ​​despite all the problems 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 we can see a solution to all these 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.780

 Laughter therapy is a technique that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.020
 we apply in psychological sessions 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.630
 so that we can help the patient he 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.520
 look at your situation but already with sense 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.320
 of humor a painful situation a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.090
 difficult situation will be able to observe 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.830
 through the sense of effort is so 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.720
 important in a personal way I 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.220
 trying to make me an autotherapy 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.410
 agreement of all those moments so 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.990
 fun and so sad that you laugh 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.610
 anger you can not have it apply as 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.650
 you can infect him like wind 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.540
 you comment there are very complicated situations 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.850
 human being that is very difficult to 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.710
 soon disengage as it applies as 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.990
 initial therapy in this sense with 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.970
 a session of laugh therapy first 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.800
 we have to help the person to 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.509
 between a moment of relaxation that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.190
 forget that all your 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.229
 problems of everything he brought and 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.620
 loading that is bothering you and 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.590

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.500
 a way to laugh a way to enjoy 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.900
 by means of medicine that is laughter 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
 then this is a process little by little 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.960
 then you can apply at home 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.699
 not necessarily in a session of 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.940
 Laughter therapy I prefer bread to chop at home 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.070
 much better not where they get contagious and 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.440
 They will laugh until their mistakes do not come 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.660
 of the dumbest things that you can 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.310
 Rian happen we are blaming or 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.979
 neither is it in tena in the part of the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.289

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.690
 self-pity better laugh are also of 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.630
 those little things now what kind of 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.400
 things are the best we can smile 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.930
 or laughter is the same as if I laugh at a 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.479
 joke that if I laugh at something that happened 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.550
 or that if I laugh for any comment is 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.300
 The same affection reads in our 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.780
 body 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.910
 7 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.590
 effect then we why that when 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.170
 we laugh when we throw a 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.660
 we started generating all those laughs 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.639
 these hormones discussed but horita 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.350
 it's the same effect of the two a laugh 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.540
 we have to learn to laugh with our 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.580
 body is nothing but laughter and 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.470
 laugh when we learn to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.510
 laugh with our body we really go 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.610

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.740
 emotional balance laugh with your body 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.780
 is that as I told you right now 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.430
 it's that moment of relaxation and when you 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.590
 you already get rid of all those 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.510
 Negative thoughts comes friendship 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.610

 with your friends take at least 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.240
 five minutes because you really 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.860
 you feel different when you apply laughter 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.200
 the mint and we will go to our 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.530
 powerful class if I like the idea 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.200
 this sentence will be written writer 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.510

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.080
 As part of our life, we have to 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.550
