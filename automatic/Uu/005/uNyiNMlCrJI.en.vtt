00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like the fact that they think that this

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.040 
like the fact that they think that this
is<00:02:53.520> good<00:02:53.790> writing<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.510> would<00:02:54.600> assume<00:02:54.690> that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
is good writing and I would assume that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.420 
is good writing and I would assume that
they<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.650> good<00:02:55.920> writing<00:02:56.100> because

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
they think this is good writing because

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.810 
they think this is good writing because
this<00:02:56.670> game<00:02:56.970> wasn't<00:02:57.780> cheap<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:59.640> at

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
this game wasn't cheap to make not at

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.720 
this game wasn't cheap to make not at
all<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:01.530> makes<00:03:01.709> me<00:03:01.860> think<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.190> like

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
all is what makes me think that like

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.120 
all is what makes me think that like
they're<00:03:03.510> treating<00:03:03.900> us<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.020> idiots<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.950> who

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
they're treating us like idiots like who

station and anybody can't not die in a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.570 
station and anybody can't not die in a
freak

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
freak

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.110 
freak
gasoline<00:04:50.120> fight<00:04:50.419> an<00:04:50.630> accident<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:52.040> yeah<00:04:52.700> so

gasoline fight an accident so yeah so
for<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.050> part<00:04:55.419> there's<00:04:56.419> two<00:04:56.690> distinct

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
for this part there's two distinct

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.159 
for this part there's two distinct
stages<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.430> would<00:04:58.490> say<00:04:58.900> four<00:04:59.900> three

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
stages to this I would say four three

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.950 
stages to this I would say four three
the<00:05:00.680> first<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:03.470> first<00:05:03.890> part<00:05:04.280> where

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
the first is this first part where

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.120 
the first is this first part where
you're<00:05:05.960> shooting<00:05:06.290> all<00:05:06.380> these<00:05:06.500> boomers<00:05:06.890> like

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
you're shooting all these boomers like

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.280 
you're shooting all these boomers like
really<00:05:07.430> far<00:05:07.640> away<00:05:07.760> don't<00:05:08.240> sit<00:05:08.750> next<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:09.140> your

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
really far away don't sit next to your

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.460 
really far away don't sit next to your
teammates<00:05:09.860> these<00:05:10.550> even<00:05:10.850> if<00:05:10.970> you're<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.840> cover

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
teammates these even if you're in cover

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.620 
teammates these even if you're in cover
the<00:05:13.040> guy<00:05:13.190> died<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.550> few<00:05:13.880> times<00:05:13.940> like<00:05:14.480> my

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
the guy died a few times like my

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.260 
the guy died a few times like my
teammate<00:05:15.110> they<00:05:15.530> would<00:05:15.650> pop<00:05:15.860> out<00:05:16.040> of<00:05:16.190> cover<00:05:16.400> the

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
teammate they would pop out of cover the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.720 
teammate they would pop out of cover the
boom<00:05:17.570> shot<00:05:17.900> would<00:05:18.620> hit<00:05:18.830> him<00:05:18.890> in<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.040> face<00:05:19.340> and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
boom shot would hit him in the face and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.750 
boom shot would hit him in the face and
they'd<00:05:20.630> be<00:05:20.750> fine<00:05:21.050> but<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.500> would<00:05:21.560> die<00:05:21.860> because<00:05:22.550> I

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
they'd be fine but I would die because I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.210 
they'd be fine but I would die because I
was<00:05:22.880> right<00:05:23.060> next<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.419> them<00:05:23.600> but<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:27.680> second

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
was right next to them but the second

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.760 
was right next to them but the second
stage<00:05:28.850> is<00:05:29.270> when<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:32.120> locusts<00:05:32.570> are<00:05:32.690> using<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
stage is when the locusts are using the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.590 
stage is when the locusts are using the
grappling<00:05:34.280> hooks<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.850> pull<00:05:35.030> themselves<00:05:35.180> up

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
grappling hooks to pull themselves up

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.159 
grappling hooks to pull themselves up
and<00:05:35.840> when<00:05:36.680> they're<00:05:36.800> doing<00:05:36.979> that<00:05:37.960> just<00:05:38.960> kind<00:05:39.110> of

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
and when they're doing that just kind of

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.730 
and when they're doing that just kind of
get<00:05:39.410> to<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.590> middle<00:05:40.070> of

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
get to the middle of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.719 
get to the middle of
this<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.940> roof<00:05:42.150> of<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.479> gas<00:05:42.690> station<00:05:42.720> and

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
this the roof of this gas station and

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.760 
this the roof of this gas station and
just<00:05:44.729> focus<00:05:45.300> on<00:05:45.449> only<00:05:45.840> shooting<00:05:46.169> those<00:05:46.410> things

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
just focus on only shooting those things

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.140 
just focus on only shooting those things
down<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.340> making<00:05:47.460> sure<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.729> none<00:05:47.970> of<00:05:48.000> them

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
down and making sure that none of them

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.700 
down and making sure that none of them
get<00:05:48.270> on<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:48.449> top<00:05:48.660> platform<00:05:48.930> like<00:05:49.349> you<00:05:49.470> won't

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
get on that top platform like you won't

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.219 
get on that top platform like you won't
get<00:05:49.889> hit<00:05:50.099> by<00:05:50.190> any<00:05:50.370> of<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.580> boob<00:05:50.729> shots<00:05:51.229> as

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
get hit by any of the boob shots as

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.089 
get hit by any of the boob shots as
they're<00:05:52.889> climbing<00:05:53.130> up<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.930> last<00:05:55.199> section

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
they're climbing up and the last section

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.600 
they're climbing up and the last section
is<00:05:56.430> when<00:05:56.699> there's<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.410> shitload<00:05:58.410> of<00:05:58.740> the

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
is when there's a shitload of the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.870 
is when there's a shitload of the
lambent<00:06:00.330> humans<00:06:00.750> running<00:06:01.620> at<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.560> then

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
lambent humans running at you and then

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.610 
lambent humans running at you and then
some<00:06:05.880> of<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.030> lambent<00:06:06.509> locust<00:06:06.870> come<00:06:07.139> too<00:06:07.380> and

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
some of the lambent locust come too and

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.670 
some of the lambent locust come too and
like<00:06:07.949> some<00:06:08.460> of<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.639> pods<00:06:08.970> spawned<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:09.990> this

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
like some of the pods spawned and this

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.020 
like some of the pods spawned and this
is<00:06:10.830> actually<00:06:11.099> a<00:06:11.130> really<00:06:11.340> hard<00:06:11.490> section<00:06:11.880> and

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
is actually a really hard section and

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.640 
is actually a really hard section and
there's<00:06:12.210> no<00:06:12.419> checkpoints<00:06:12.990> in<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:13.229> last<00:06:13.470> part

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
there's no checkpoints in this last part

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.960 
there's no checkpoints in this last part
at<00:06:13.770> all<00:06:13.860> so<00:06:15.020> you<00:06:16.020> really<00:06:16.229> have<00:06:16.349> to<00:06:16.470> use

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
at all so you really have to use

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.939 
at all so you really have to use
hopefully<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.120> got<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.300> decent<00:06:18.590> sound<00:06:19.590> system

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
hopefully you got a decent sound system

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.649 
hopefully you got a decent sound system
you<00:06:19.979> can<00:06:20.220> actually<00:06:20.340> hear<00:06:20.819> like<00:06:21.090> left<00:06:21.389> from

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
you can actually hear like left from

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.719 
you can actually hear like left from
right<00:06:21.690> but<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.560> can<00:06:22.710> hear<00:06:22.949> pretty<00:06:23.220> distinctly

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
right but you can hear pretty distinctly

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.490 
right but you can hear pretty distinctly
where<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:27.210> grappling<00:06:27.569> hooks<00:06:27.810> are<00:06:28.139> coming

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
where the the grappling hooks are coming

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.670 
where the the grappling hooks are coming
up<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:29.599> they're<00:06:30.599> pretty<00:06:30.750> easy<00:06:30.960> to<00:06:31.199> shoot<00:06:31.409> they

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
up and they're pretty easy to shoot they

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.589 
up and they're pretty easy to shoot they
turn<00:06:31.919> red<00:06:32.190> when<00:06:32.789> they're<00:06:33.090> targetable<00:06:33.960> so<00:06:35.599> is

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
turn red when they're targetable so is

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.180 
turn red when they're targetable so is
that<00:06:36.780> the<00:06:36.870> only<00:06:36.990> threat<00:06:37.259> of<00:06:37.380> dying<00:06:37.590> is<00:06:37.860> them

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
that the only threat of dying is them

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.879 
that the only threat of dying is them
getting<00:06:38.520> up<00:06:38.610> to<00:06:38.849> you<00:06:38.940> at<00:06:39.750> this<00:06:40.050> stage<00:06:40.110> in<00:06:40.710> a

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
getting up to you at this stage in a

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.140 
getting up to you at this stage in a
second<00:06:41.280> or<00:06:41.400> two<00:06:41.430> there's<00:06:41.819> gonna<00:06:41.970> be<00:06:42.120> a

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
second or two there's gonna be a

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.850 
second or two there's gonna be a
fuckload<00:06:42.569> of<00:06:42.870> those<00:06:42.990> laman<00:06:43.319> humans<00:06:43.650> running

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
fuckload of those laman humans running
