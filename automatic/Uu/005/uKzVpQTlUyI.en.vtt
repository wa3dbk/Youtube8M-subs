00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 happy coincidence that led him to develop

 his passion for boxing in a school 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600

 the world my master firearms me 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.600
 asked if it would tempt me easily 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.539
 why not imagine or weary 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 point puts the hockey pie at 40 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.530
 years he has reached most of his 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.200
 career goals but remains active 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.940
 in the ring he is more dedicated to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.690
 training young boxers at his 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.690
 repentigny gym 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.390
 a few years ago by force 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.310
 training and hard fighting 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.720
 renan st just suffered a significant 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 left thumb injury 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.080
 this one could have had 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.479
 major consequences on his career 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.979
 professional he called upon 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.020
 services of the plastic surgeon 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.509
 specialist hand doctor 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.680
 jean-paul brutus really came to me 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.330
 see 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.640
 very worried because he's a boxer 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.570
 high level professional he already has 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.549
 unfortunately like a lot of 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.700
 boxers had several injuries to 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.800
 level of the hands and he had a 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.530
 he had already had a fracture that had 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.630
 badly healed at thumb level here and there 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.830
 he was consulting because he had 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.229
 pains that had appeared at the base 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.909
 his thumb so there push him in three 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.340
 articulations he had already left two 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.289
 compromise on the 3 he was very 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.929
 worried about his professional future and 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.360
 renan came to see me by telling me if 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.649
 we do nothing my career is over and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.270
 so you have to do something 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.280
 thing for me I'm ready to take 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.269
 all the risks to be able to return 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.269
 in professional combat 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.070
 we actually perform this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.940
 surgery to correct osteoarthritis he 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.390
 had at the base of his thumb and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.630
 the intervention was very very good 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040
 spent his recovery was a speed 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.570
 quite spectacular because it's a 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.520
 guy who is very very motivated 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.820
 I was not boxing with full confidence 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.940
 full insurers full freedom 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.250
 now I can hit and then I'll do 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.500
 after a few months of recovery 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 renan st-just will finally find his 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.980
 full potential 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 by the way he won a big 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.410
 part of these small after his 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 surgical intervention 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.330
 for the doctor brutus at the peristyle of 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.620
 passion does not come without a heavy 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.210
 share of responsibility 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.000
 treat high level athletes 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.400
 it's a challenge that's a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.590
 challenge that comes with that because they have 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.840
 obviously expectations that goes beyond 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.060
 expectations of more normal individuals one 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.880
 will say but also these are people 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.200
 who are extremely motivated so that's 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.940
 people who are not afraid to switch to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.610
 through the pain of people who did not 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.180
 not afraid to submit to all kinds 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.340
 of treatments 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.600
 because they have a very very clear purpose 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.730
 in mind and they are in general 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.930
 so motivated that they make the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.570
 much easier thing for us 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.430
 today that years unjust continues 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.740
 to live your passion every day 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.510
 I am currently proud of what 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.980
 I accomplished so far when 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.860
 it was not my first goal in life 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.420
 she dr there it's very nice to 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.120
 those of getting involved in the care of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.940
 these of his athletes because the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.080
 reward is often source in 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.080
 proportion with their passion
