00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
pretty interesting for me because I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.290 
pretty interesting for me because I
don't<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.830> very<00:02:15.860> good<00:02:16.130> hip<00:02:16.460> mobility<00:02:16.640> and

ways that you can do this pull and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.910 
ways that you can do this pull and
they're<00:02:32.570> gonna<00:02:32.690> put<00:02:32.900> different<00:02:33.290> demands<00:02:33.770> on

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
they're gonna put different demands on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.830 
they're gonna put different demands on
you<00:02:34.430> know<00:02:34.550> different<00:02:35.000> little<00:02:35.210> muscle<00:02:35.570> groups

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you know different little muscle groups

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.170 
you know different little muscle groups
so<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.830> going<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.250> interesting<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.910> play

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so it's going to be interesting to play

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.510 
so it's going to be interesting to play
around<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.720> but<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.590> first<00:02:39.770> week<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.370> I

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
around with but this first week like I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.610 
around with but this first week like I
said<00:02:40.760> well<00:02:41.360> with<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> pretty<00:02:41.810> medium<00:02:42.200> stance

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
said well with a pretty medium stance

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.980 
said well with a pretty medium stance
and<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.490> was<00:02:43.730> fairly<00:02:44.240> happy<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.600> how<00:02:44.840> these

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
and I was fairly happy with how these

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.620 
and I was fairly happy with how these
felt<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.460> was<00:02:46.730> right<00:02:47.030> after<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.390> meet

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
felt now this was right after the meet

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.590 
felt now this was right after the meet
so<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> stuck<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.890> be<00:02:49.130> loads<00:02:49.390> d<00:02:50.390> load

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
so I stuck with really be loads d load

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.470 
so I stuck with really be loads d load
weights<00:02:51.200> basically<00:02:51.920> Indy<00:02:52.280> load<00:02:52.520> rep<00:02:53.060> scheme

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
weights basically Indy load rep scheme

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.390 
weights basically Indy load rep scheme
so<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:53.960> didn't<00:02:54.230> go<00:02:54.320> anywhere<00:02:54.350> close<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.160> failure

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
so I didn't go anywhere close to failure

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.150 
so I didn't go anywhere close to failure
this<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.090> 135<00:02:56.840> here<00:02:57.170> four<00:02:57.410> sets<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.830> five

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
this is just 135 here four sets of five

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.980 
this is just 135 here four sets of five
and<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:01.130> one<00:03:01.160> thing<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.850> noticed<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and the one thing that I noticed the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.170 
and the one thing that I noticed the
main<00:03:03.170> thing<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.620> was<00:03:03.800> unhappy<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.340> was

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
main thing that I was unhappy with was

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.720 
main thing that I was unhappy with was
my<00:03:05.360> knees<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.900> my<00:03:06.260> shoulders<00:03:06.710> at<00:03:07.010> times<00:03:07.460> at

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
my knees and my shoulders at times at

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.720 
my knees and my shoulders at times at
least<00:03:07.940> we're<00:03:08.150> coming<00:03:08.420> out<00:03:08.510> over<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> bar<00:03:09.080> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
least we're coming out over the bar and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.220 
least we're coming out over the bar and
that<00:03:10.730> did<00:03:10.940> two<00:03:11.180> things<00:03:11.510> one<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.110> was

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that did two things one it was

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.890 
that did two things one it was
inefficient<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.240> secondly<00:03:14.240> I<00:03:14.270> was<00:03:14.510> kind<00:03:14.810> of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
inefficient and secondly I was kind of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.020 
inefficient and secondly I was kind of
focused<00:03:15.350> on<00:03:15.590> getting<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.340> bar<00:03:16.550> around<00:03:16.730> my

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
focused on getting the bar around my

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.090 
focused on getting the bar around my
knee<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.480> what<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> need<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.020> do<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.320> fix<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.680> is

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
knee so what I need to do to fix that is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.010 
knee so what I need to do to fix that is
to<00:03:19.130> find<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.580> way<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.730> get<00:03:19.970> my<00:03:20.090> hips<00:03:20.330> more<00:03:20.600> open

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
to find a way to get my hips more open

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.260 
to find a way to get my hips more open
and<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.920> could<00:03:22.100> do<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> number<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.850> ways<00:03:23.030> I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
and I could do that a number of ways I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.490 
and I could do that a number of ways I
could<00:03:23.420> play<00:03:23.600> around<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:23.990> different<00:03:24.110> foot

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
could play around with different foot

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.230 
could play around with different foot
placements<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:25.220> could<00:03:25.400> play<00:03:25.610> around<00:03:25.700> with<00:03:25.970> you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
placements I could play around with you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.510 
placements I could play around with you
know<00:03:26.270> different<00:03:26.540> stances<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.380> general<00:03:27.830> but

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
know different stances in general but

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.370 
know different stances in general but
the<00:03:28.610> most<00:03:28.790> important<00:03:29.360> thing<00:03:29.660> for<00:03:29.930> me<00:03:30.080> has<00:03:30.200> been

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
the most important thing for me has been

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.890 
the most important thing for me has been
just<00:03:30.680> hip<00:03:30.890> mobility<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.420> do<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> video

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
just hip mobility so I can do a video

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.810 
just hip mobility so I can do a video
specifically<00:03:33.770> on<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.980> hip<00:03:34.160> mobility<00:03:34.250> that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820
