00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
then you die out and bleed out so you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.700 
then you die out and bleed out so you
have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.230> careful<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.559> them

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
have to be really careful with them

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
have to be really careful with them
because<00:00:52.829> they're<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:54.120> really

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
because they're really really really

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.170 
because they're really really really
strong<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.980> if<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.280> round<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:56.969> lasts

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
strong and if that round actually lasts

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
strong and if that round actually lasts
forever<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.739> understand<00:00:59.039> why

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
forever and I don't understand why

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
forever and I don't understand why
there's<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> many<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> them<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.510> guess<00:01:00.690> because

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
there's so many of them I guess because

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
there's so many of them I guess because
they're<00:01:01.109> four<00:01:01.260> players<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.710> duh<00:01:02.219> but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they're four players in the game duh but

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
they're four players in the game duh but
now<00:01:04.199> let's<00:01:04.409> talk<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.100> video<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
now let's talk about what this video is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.469 
now let's talk about what this video is
about<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.760> video<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> ultimate

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
about this video is the ultimate

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.250 
about this video is the ultimate
strategy<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.450> survive<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.780> rise<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
strategy on how to survive that rise and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
strategy on how to survive that rise and
get<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> highest<00:01:11.070> round<00:01:11.400> possible

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
get to the highest round possible

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
get to the highest round possible
basically<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.080> doing<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.500> if
