00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.450

 we 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.430
 it's something that I think is the first 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.640
 time I kill so many followed and I do not know 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.640

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.470
 in the rpg so let's see if we can 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.470
 continue with the recipe 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.739

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.150

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.500
 He has not had time to throw me 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.850

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.850
 300 to 310 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.140

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.639

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.060
 take advantage of them 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.160
 here 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.160
 come on comes another 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.620
 come I had him back there waiting for the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.990
 barrels fuck 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.440
 good 630 points has left the one who was 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.440
 second 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.330
 where are we going 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.840
 resist half an hour in recharge to 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.509
 male 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.569
 I have one left, I have one left because 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.970
 it was good then 39 9 there was a rival 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.430
 that has left the 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.860
 departure but it's pretty evenly matched 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.430
 half game at least and we go super 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.379
 matched but nothing of 670 points 39 to 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.360
 9 with a super low out there I do not 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.770
 agreement with what weapon has been but with 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.080
 This has also been quite rpg 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.940
 bayless bundled very much but nothing I hope 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.940
 what you liked and until next time
