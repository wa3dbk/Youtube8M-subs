just<00:00:32.129> because<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.879> have<00:00:33.059> dark<00:00:33.300> circles

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
just because I don't have dark circles

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.470 
just because I don't have dark circles
and<00:00:34.019> so<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.559> me<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.220> entities<00:00:35.699> kind<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:36.300> work

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and so for me the entities kind of work

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.210 
and so for me the entities kind of work
because<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.080> highlights<00:00:37.650> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> same

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
because it also highlights at the same

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.189 
because it also highlights at the same
time<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.269> have<00:00:39.449> dark<00:00:39.690> circles<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
time if you do have dark circles you

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.590 
time if you do have dark circles you
want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> shy<00:00:40.680> away<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.550> end<00:00:41.730> C's<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.449> go

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
want to shy away from the end C's and go

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.140 
want to shy away from the end C's and go
more<00:00:42.839> towards<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.350> w's<00:00:43.949> because<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.850> pink

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
more towards and w's because the pink

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.030

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
bone this does have a lot of shimmer so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.280 
bone this does have a lot of shimmer so
it's<00:02:05.790> gonna<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.120> ahead<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.450> highlight<00:02:06.750> those

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it's gonna go ahead and highlight those

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's gonna go ahead and highlight those
areas<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> deepen<00:02:09.599> my<00:02:09.750> crease<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.409> create

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
areas now to deepen my crease and create

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.070 
areas now to deepen my crease and create
more<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> definition<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.870> with

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
more of a definition I'm going in with

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.199 
more of a definition I'm going in with
this<00:02:13.290> soft<00:02:14.010> brown<00:02:14.430> color<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
this soft brown color but it is

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.970 
this soft brown color but it is
definitely<00:02:15.450> buildable<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.470> I'm<00:02:16.560> gonna<00:02:16.769> go

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
definitely buildable so I'm gonna go

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.860 
definitely buildable so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.340> layer<00:02:17.519> about<00:02:17.790> three<00:02:18.180> times<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
ahead and layer about three times and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.320 
ahead and layer about three times and
blend<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.800> into<00:02:20.069> my

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
blend this into my

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.720 
blend this into my
crease<00:02:20.630> now<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.470> see<00:02:21.800> when<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
crease now as you can see when I get to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.910 
crease now as you can see when I get to
the<00:02:22.820> inner<00:02:23.060> corners<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.870> do<00:02:23.990> like<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.530> take<00:02:24.800> this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
the inner corners I do like to take this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040 
the inner corners I do like to take this
color<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.490> all<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.150> way<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.330> my<00:02:26.570> brow<00:02:26.810> bone

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050

color up all the way to my brow bone
just<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.920> inner<00:02:28.070> corners<00:02:28.610> because<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
just on the inner corners because this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.570 
just on the inner corners because this
really<00:02:29.870> helps<00:02:30.350> open<00:02:30.560> up<00:02:30.800> my<00:02:31.010> eye<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.490> I
