00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.990
 What is the difference between ambient light shooting and flash shooting? 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.130
 Hi! Today, we are shooting with this in the bush. 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.900
 She is our great model, we are going to take two photos today. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 First of all, what we are going to shoot is purely ambient light. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 Then we use the flash to shoot 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
 To present an earth-shaking change 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.130
 Of course, we hope that both sets of photos are very good. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.600
 First start shooting ambient light 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.360
 The light source we use is the sun, and the light is coming from this direction. 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.110
 It swept through the snuggle 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.899
 Shine onto the reflector and then reflect back 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.199
 This is a silver reflector, so we can reflect most of the light 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.990
 After the light is reflected, it fills the darkness of her shadow well. 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.100
 There is also an eye in the eyes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.520
 So let’s start shooting 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.620
 Oh, by the way, 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.930
 There are a lot of works around, so you can hear a lot of noise. 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.330
 So we are starting now. Oh, get ready... come on! 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.230
 well 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.999
 Now we are ready to turn the reflector to the side 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.970
 In other words, it is not used at all. 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.070
 I am not going to use it now. 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.130
 Because it uses it, it may reflect the light of some flash 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.080
 Now I will open all the flashes to see how 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 The first thing I want to open is the set of flashes behind me, it’s B2. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.440
 It is an off-camera flash unit 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.600
 There is a soft light box behind the head. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440
 I am going to open these and see what happens. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.670
 Then we have to have some background light 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 Let's open the flash via the Air Remote 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.610
 Ok, are you ready, snuggle? 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.149
 I have to shoot... well! 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.370
 Very good, perfect! 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.870
 Ok, this is the case with a set of lights. 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.790
 Now we are ready to turn on all the lights to compare 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.319
 They can be opened here very easily via the Air Remote 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.580
 We are going to turn on the backlight now. 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940
 Then we have to trigger all the lights, are you ready to shoot again? I have to shoot. 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.740
 Again... 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 Come, ok! that's it! ! 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.740
 well
