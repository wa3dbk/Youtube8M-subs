00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.490 
you know zombie cleo and soldier and
bully<00:02:48.750> creeper<00:02:49.170> etc

and watch it but anyways this videos
about<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.900> trap<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> used<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.130> if<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:58.150> have

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
about the trap I used and if you have

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.990 
about the trap I used and if you have
seen<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> footage<00:02:59.400> there<00:03:00.400> was<00:03:00.490> like<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.790> whole

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
seen the footage there was like a whole

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.580 
seen the footage there was like a whole
bunch<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.510> redstone<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.070> floor<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.600> yeah

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
bunch of redstone on the floor and yeah

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.800 
bunch of redstone on the floor and yeah
basically<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.250> was<00:03:06.400> all<00:03:06.550> meant<00:03:06.910> as<00:03:07.150> as<00:03:07.720> a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
basically that was all meant as as a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.360 
basically that was all meant as as a
decoy

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
decoy

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.090 
decoy
the<00:03:09.850> only<00:03:10.000> redstone<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.690> need<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.260> my<00:03:11.650> my

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
the only redstone you need for my my

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.360 
the only redstone you need for my my
trap<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:13.000> we're<00:03:13.390> gonna<00:03:13.510> call<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:13.959> trap

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
trap and we're gonna call it my trap

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.410 
trap and we're gonna call it my trap
because<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.490> think<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.030> first<00:03:16.180> one

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
because I think it's the first one

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.390 
because I think it's the first one
that's<00:03:16.780> been<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.410> sort<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:17.860> successful

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that's been you know sort of successful

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.340 
that's been you know sort of successful
and<00:03:18.670> you're<00:03:18.850> at<00:03:18.910> sea<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.020> only<00:03:20.140> thing<00:03:20.320> you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
and you're at sea but the only thing you

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.410 
and you're at sea but the only thing you
need<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.709> normal<00:03:21.100> piston<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.580> stone<00:03:22.150> pressure

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
need is a normal piston a stone pressure

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.270 
need is a normal piston a stone pressure
plate<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.140> redstone<00:03:23.350> dust<00:03:23.709> like<00:03:23.980> all<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
plate and one redstone dust like all the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190 
plate and one redstone dust like all the
other<00:03:24.400> stuff<00:03:24.610> was<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:24.760> made<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.120> decoy<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.780> was

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
other stuff was just made as decoy I was

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960 
other stuff was just made as decoy I was
kind<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.500> expecting<00:03:27.100> like<00:03:27.459> people<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:27.820> not

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
kind of expecting like people do not

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.840 
kind of expecting like people do not
fall<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.959> then<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.860> know<00:03:29.980> disabling

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
fall for it and then you know disabling

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.250 
fall for it and then you know disabling
the<00:03:31.000> trap<00:03:31.239> by<00:03:31.420> knocking<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.900> some<00:03:32.050> redstone

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
the trap by knocking out some redstone

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.199 
the trap by knocking out some redstone
and<00:03:32.500> then<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> way<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.280> they<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:33.910> still

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
and then on the way up they would still

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.850 
and then on the way up they would still
fall<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:34.510> my<00:03:34.720> trap<00:03:34.959> after<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.470> killed<00:03:35.709> me

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
fall in my trap after that it killed me

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.979 
fall in my trap after that it killed me
which<00:03:36.040> would<00:03:36.190> have<00:03:36.280> been<00:03:36.400> hilarious<00:03:36.520> but<00:03:37.510> that

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
which would have been hilarious but that

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.020 
which would have been hilarious but that
was<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.890> end<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.400> wasn't

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
was like in the end that that wasn't

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.860 
was like in the end that that wasn't
necessary<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.860> yeah<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.270> look<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> now

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
necessary but yeah if you look at it now

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.570 
necessary but yeah if you look at it now
down<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.350> stairs<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.920> looks<00:03:45.190> not

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
down the stairs this looks not

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.790 
down the stairs this looks not
suspicious<00:03:46.000> at<00:03:46.300> all<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:47.230> if<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.410> point<00:03:47.650> my

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
suspicious at all but if I point my

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.350 
suspicious at all but if I point my
mouse<00:03:48.489> there<00:03:48.760> you'll<00:03:48.910> see<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.090> there's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
mouse there you'll see that there's

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
mouse there you'll see that there's
actually<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.780> stone<00:03:50.140> pressure<00:03:50.410> plate<00:03:50.680> there

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
actually a stone pressure plate there

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.000 
actually a stone pressure plate there
it's<00:03:51.400> extremely<00:03:52.209> difficult<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.690> see

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's extremely difficult to see

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.210 
it's extremely difficult to see
extremely<00:03:54.010> difficult<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.430> see<00:03:56.100> but<00:03:57.100> yeah

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
extremely difficult to see but yeah

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.300 
extremely difficult to see but yeah
basically<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.150> go<00:03:58.330> like<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.680> instant

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
basically if I go like this it's instant

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.220 
basically if I go like this it's instant
like<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.580> piston<00:04:01.000> extends<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.690> fall<00:04:02.019> down

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
like a piston extends and you fall down

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.740 
like a piston extends and you fall down
and<00:04:02.610> depending<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.700> deep<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.090> you'll<00:04:04.450> you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and depending on deep it is you'll you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.289 
and depending on deep it is you'll you
know<00:04:04.870> die<00:04:05.200> unless<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.160> have<00:04:06.400> feather<00:04:07.030> falling

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
know die unless you have feather falling

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.979 
know die unless you have feather falling
or<00:04:07.570> something<00:04:08.040> which<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> kind<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.489> unlikely

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
or something which is kind of unlikely

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.770 
or something which is kind of unlikely
but<00:04:10.989> this<00:04:11.620> is<00:04:11.739> basically<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:13.510> setup

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
but this is basically the this setup

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.949 
but this is basically the this setup
there's<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> redstone<00:04:15.160> dust<00:04:15.780> normal<00:04:16.780> block

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
there's a redstone dust normal block

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.069 
there's a redstone dust normal block
piston<00:04:17.620> pressure<00:04:18.430> plate<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.540> then<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.900> just

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
piston pressure plate and then you just

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.790 
piston pressure plate and then you just
you<00:04:20.200> know<00:04:21.030> put<00:04:22.030> some<00:04:22.270> stone<00:04:22.750> cobblestone<00:04:23.650> in

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
you know put some stone cobblestone in

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.290 
you know put some stone cobblestone in
the<00:04:23.890> furnace<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.370> make<00:04:24.490> smooth<00:04:24.790> stone<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.240> you

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the furnace to make smooth stone and you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.170 
the furnace to make smooth stone and you
cover<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.690> all<00:04:25.840> up<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.580> actually<00:04:27.790> had<00:04:30.180> like

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
cover it all up and I actually had like

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.620 
cover it all up and I actually had like
a<00:04:31.210> piece<00:04:31.479> of<00:04:31.630> cobblestone<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:33.370> here<00:04:33.760> just<00:04:34.450> to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
a piece of cobblestone like here just to

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.080 
a piece of cobblestone like here just to
make<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.810> less<00:04:35.770> likely<00:04:36.100> for<00:04:36.310> players<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.000> be

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
make it less likely for players to be

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.570 
make it less likely for players to be
able<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.270> sneak<00:04:37.330> around<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.870> corner<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:39.280> even

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
able to sneak around the corner but even

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.850 
able to sneak around the corner but even
that<00:04:39.729> like<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.750> it's<00:04:41.080> extremely<00:04:41.680> difficult

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that like it's it's extremely difficult

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.530 
that like it's it's extremely difficult
technically<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.760> like<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.060> had<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.300> hold<00:04:43.450> shift

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
technically I like I had to hold shift

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.990 
technically I like I had to hold shift
and<00:04:43.990> stuff<00:04:44.200> there<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.310> go<00:04:45.490> around<00:04:45.790> the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
and stuff there if you go around the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.890 
and stuff there if you go around the
corner<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.450> could<00:04:46.630> maybe<00:04:46.900> make<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:48.900> but

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
corner you could maybe make it but

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.240 
corner you could maybe make it but
that's<00:04:49.990> why<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.290> have<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.740> block<00:04:51.010> there

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
that's why you have like a block there

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.150 
that's why you have like a block there
and<00:04:52.380> when<00:04:53.380> you're<00:04:53.590> like<00:04:53.770> doing<00:04:53.979> this

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
and when you're like doing this

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.909 
and when you're like doing this

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
unsuspectedly it's a lot more difficult

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.540 
unsuspectedly it's a lot more difficult
to<00:04:57.820> do<00:04:59.669> but<00:05:00.669> yeah<00:05:00.820> guys<00:05:01.240> I
