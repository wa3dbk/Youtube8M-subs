to<00:03:17.870> go<00:03:18.019> over<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.459> spray<00:03:19.730> a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
to go over and you can just spray a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.820 
to go over and you can just spray a
little<00:03:19.849> on<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.360> leave<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:20.810> 30<00:03:21.200> seconds

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
little on and leave it on for 30 seconds

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.520 
little on and leave it on for 30 seconds
but<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.519> will<00:03:22.730> get<00:03:23.060> your<00:03:23.269> curling<00:03:23.630> irons<00:03:24.110> nice

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530

but it will get your curling irons nice
and<00:03:25.299> clean<00:03:26.299> but<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> would<00:03:27.680> wipe<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.100> again<00:03:28.370> with

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
and clean but I would wipe it again with

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.360 
and clean but I would wipe it again with
another<00:03:29.120> clean<00:03:29.450> cloth<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.200> as<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.130> can<00:03:31.310> see

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
another clean cloth and as you can see

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.370 
another clean cloth and as you can see
this<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.330> comes<00:03:32.780> right<00:03:33.140> off

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
this it just comes right off

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.410 
this it just comes right off
everything<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.069> wipes<00:03:34.370> right<00:03:34.549> off<00:03:34.819> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
everything just wipes right off so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.759 
everything just wipes right off so
that's<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.340> couple<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.730> spritzes

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that's one and just a couple of spritzes

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.380 
that's one and just a couple of spritzes
and<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:40.400> one<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.640> don't<00:03:40.760> really<00:03:40.970> use<00:03:41.360> that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
and this one I don't really use that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:57.420 
and this one I don't really use that
often<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.380> use<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.280> one<00:03:43.430> very<00:03:43.790> rarely

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.050 

so<00:03:58.990> it's<00:03:59.990> important<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.440> keep<00:04:00.620> your<00:04:01.060> styling

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
so it's important to keep your styling

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.690 
so it's important to keep your styling
tools<00:04:02.300> clean<00:04:02.660> because<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.680> use<00:04:03.950> like<00:04:04.400> any

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
tools clean because if you use like any

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.900 
tools clean because if you use like any
type<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.060> hair<00:04:06.050> sprays<00:04:06.440> or<00:04:07.040> spritzes<00:04:07.790> or

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
type of hair sprays or spritzes or

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.030 
type of hair sprays or spritzes or
anything<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.500> get<00:04:09.770> all<00:04:10.010> over

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
anything like that it can get all over

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.890 
anything like that it can get all over
your<00:04:10.490> iron<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.000> they<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.270> cause<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.570> little

and there's just a little bit of residue
right<00:05:18.199> on<00:05:18.439> the<00:05:18.679> plates<00:05:19.329> and<00:05:20.329> we're<00:05:20.449> going<00:05:20.569> to

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
right on the plates and we're going to

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.269 
right on the plates and we're going to
do<00:05:20.779> the<00:05:20.929> same<00:05:21.199> thing<00:05:21.499> I'm<00:05:21.739> going<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:21.979> just<00:05:22.129> use

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
do the same thing I'm going to just use

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:30.429 
do the same thing I'm going to just use
this<00:05:22.489> same<00:05:22.729> paper<00:05:22.999> towel<00:05:28.719> and<00:05:29.719> I<00:05:29.839> just<00:05:30.139> sprayed

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
this same paper towel and I just sprayed

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.589 
this same paper towel and I just sprayed
both<00:05:30.679> sides<00:05:31.039> of<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.309> plate<00:05:31.549> I'm<00:05:32.329> going<00:05:32.539> to

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
both sides of the plate I'm going to

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.589 
both sides of the plate I'm going to
just<00:05:32.779> let<00:05:32.929> that<00:05:33.110> sit<00:05:33.469> for<00:05:33.499> just<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.069> second

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
just let that sit for just a second

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.299 
just let that sit for just a second
because<00:05:35.599> sometimes<00:05:36.259> we<00:05:36.469> get<00:05:36.649> a<00:05:36.679> lot<00:05:37.069> of

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:37.309 
because sometimes we get a lot of

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.669 
because sometimes we get a lot of
residue<00:05:37.819> right<00:05:38.119> in<00:05:38.389> these<00:05:38.539> little<00:05:38.869> creases<00:05:39.139> on

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:39.679 
residue right in these little creases on

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:43.359 
residue right in these little creases on
the<00:05:39.739> ends<00:05:41.649> and<00:05:42.649> as<00:05:42.739> you<00:05:42.889> can<00:05:43.009> see<00:05:43.069> it's

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
the ends and as you can see it's

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.089 
the ends and as you can see it's
bubbling<00:05:43.669> up<00:05:43.969> a<00:05:44.089> little<00:05:44.360> bit<00:05:44.479> right<00:05:44.899> there

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
bubbling up a little bit right there

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.969 
bubbling up a little bit right there
hoping<00:05:46.099> you<00:05:46.219> can<00:05:46.369> see<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:50.559> I'm<00:05:51.559> just<00:05:51.799> going
