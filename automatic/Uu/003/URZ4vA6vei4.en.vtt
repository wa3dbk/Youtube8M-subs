 welcome to the 28th 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.189
 episode of our pack road to glory us 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.110
 have a few right at the beginning again 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.519
 contract cards and so on sold 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.039
 but now also pull directly and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 Saxony ticket per month and have it in there 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 that is the defender of the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 changed from arsenal to hanover 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.939
 just now, incidentally, have it by the way 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 Julio cesar we definitely 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.710
 for our bpm can use like 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 Giro is in a good pace 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 could definitely be ours 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 federal team com contracts of course 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 will add 1000 mÃ¼nchen 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 optimal and another free concert 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 What more could you want in a pack 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.820
 pretty good and put the rest 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.559
 we do not need to take care of it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.710
 and I would say that's where you come from 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.719
 straight to our gold we just 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.309
 We got it for free 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 and now we move 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 Many of you will become rolando 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.170
 probably also Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 or whatever you read or 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 must have had a packed goal and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.789
 thought you have cristiano ronaldo 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 pulled but we now have the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.019
 defender of naples drawn 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 he does not look too bad 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.860
 and by the way , of course we have again 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 Contract fitness cards are now 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.840
 sell everything 451 outstanding 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 we definitely need for our 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.530
 Team is it I believe that we are with 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.240
 4 5 1 play 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 I think the rest is what I think 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 even just spent a player to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 we have in the first pack and see here 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.229
 We have many fitness cards 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.000
 but all can not use because 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.259
 We always switch back and forth 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 that's why we'll be the ones to me all 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 hoyos says it's just sold 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.110
 come to the gate to our premier 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 league team considering the chemistry 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.439
 raised by two points and now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.259
 chico will get these 451 kasemi on 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.530
 98 as we are almost at a 100 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.240
 chemistry in our bpl team also looks 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 ever pretty good and I would 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.299
 say now we start thanks also into 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 play two points with this team 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.590
 we still need the league title 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 I think we'll make it 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 We have four games left 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.390
 In any case, no problem for us 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.700
 become 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.290
 the adversary is also found fc inter 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 hot there with the jerseys then goes 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 now sometime smooth so 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.989
 we found everything perfect here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 look at the theme of balotelli 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.530
 eto'o yes with the chemistry out not so 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 100 percent 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.640
 79 is still ok david luiz 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.730
 the most feared 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.410
 defender next to so very strong 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.720
 team and start right in the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.090
 first scene of the enemy is playing here 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 to richards and now have a look 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.989
 like this one plays around right in the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.870
 first scene he Tippelt back there rum 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.390
 and wait until we play attack then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 In the end, we'll leave and we can 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.840
 then in this scene the ball for us 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.520
 win gives him there and then 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.430
 have you ever insight as the opponent 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.200
 has started 24 minutes so far is not 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.790
 much happened oxlade chamberlain shows 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.220
 her the first time he has it on game 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.860
 to ramirez the ball comes to nasri 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 the one to valencia and that tries the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 watch out wet but how is 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.890
 blocked so this was the first scene 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.410
 but now is in the 36 minute tampa bay 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.720
 the ball pulls in front of it is in 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.700
 the 16er one plays then swat the and 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.980
 we want to break off but the extra 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.209
 Goalkeeper field and around and thus there are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.650
 the eleven-meter 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.239
 I was not sure if I was 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 to make the rhyme or not because of it 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.620
 had been had bout yes all times 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.570
 But then this game scene or the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.060
 play of the opponent in memory and 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.239
 just thought then fuck you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.000
 you have to go through the rhine 37 minute 1 0 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.890
 samir nasri look at that again on 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.450
 beautifully made he reveals the keeper 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.329
 and then we are already in the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 second half of the opponents on soon 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.320
 but balotelli we can get 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 Too Lala the rider too long 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 perfect pass in the gap to wet ried 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.840
 and it does not burn anything 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.630
 he marks his second goal in 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.459
 the 61 minute splendid combination and 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.320
 then this pass from long the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.690
 Interface rows perfect for nasri 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.630
 submitted and of course perfect 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.850
 Perfectly done, that's perfect 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.320
 and then we do not start 56 minutes 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.720
 Valencia gets the ball grabs 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.910
 before it is implemented but also stands 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.549
 after his bloodstreak respect him 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.310
 goes into it then job then on 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.480
 Goalkeeper firmly unfortunately one too many 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.410
 otherwise I will be a nice one 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.180
 been dribbling 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.579
 the opponent is then in possession of the ball 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.410
 plays on balotelli and then comes the 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.079
 ball to cassano but then take a look 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.669
 this chico maximilian really perfect 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.670
 made and a nice dribbling and 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.220
 Now look at them 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.290
 a combination at the devil wall is 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.360
 back long with the look driver unfortunately 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.340
 he is not pure what a monster 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.770
 combination so that was really one 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.620
 the best combination in one touch 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.420
 are manier I've played so far 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.160
 in the already 82 minute to saw 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.810
 that the opponents have a chance had 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.880
 long then you are clever and crowned 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.250
 this beautiful long pass with 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.610
 a splendid lupfer to the 3 0 in the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.110
 83 minutes it should be now what 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.460
 a beautiful graduation still 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.100
 no chance for the keeper 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.630
 he just gets nibbled and then he is 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.940
 We are also in the next scene 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.500
 in the 84 minute lana gets the ball 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.700
 sends valencia who is now 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.770
 actually up and away 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.540
 Then you over with the over- excitement 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.060
 scoop turn and the conclusion with the 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.270
 left foot unfortunately too weak the goalkeeper 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.130
 Holds 89 minute pushes off the ball is coming 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.930
 to ramirez the on long the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.240
 just eat the enemy zack zack 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.110
 made and the long short sits in 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.970
 the long corner 90 minute 40 look that 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.040
 normal long almost easy the whole 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.320
 defense and then such a hammer 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.900
 pacta out of the game is over 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.900
 put 4 0 through the gates of long and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.820
 nasri ever 2 made long will be player of 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.550

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:43.000
 Super game delivered 630 coins there 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.000

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.219
 back from our big house we are 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.319
 arrived in the ultimate team menu 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.749
 We also directly a lot of contract 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.999
 have sold fitness cards and all that 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.589

 so we go a look in the shop 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.800
 and then let's see we go 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:12.019

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.749

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.070

 We still have an Italian we can 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.650
 but certainly use 352 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.780
 optimal formation there we still have 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.669
 parasitic or barazite no idea how 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.410
 one we pronounce the dutch 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.450
 just trying to sell the rest 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.860
 So let's put it a shit pack

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.540
 zanini there can be him and now we have 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.830
 the 100 achieved what is something 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.290
 quickly realized that we made it 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.340
 have a team of 100 chemistry ours 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.020
 pack go to glory 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.880
 I find that very strong then 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.840
 we are still in the central offensive 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.840
 midfield 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.419
 out there, thanks, love is coming now 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.789
 one ms to zgm card after he gets 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.740
 another 4 2 3 1 formation skate then 

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:03.240
 The whole thing should look pretty good 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.250
 It was that from now on 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.120
 Actually, even me 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.740
 I'm not one hundred percent right now 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.479
 fit as you may have noticed 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.810
 that's why not comments 

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:14.820
 here on 100 percent but on Wednesday 

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.380
 it goes on directly that's it for me 

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.950
 I hope you have fun made skin 

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.950
