00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 surely for this moment you've seen 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.090
 the video of bryan carrasco that is of 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.750
 fashion here on youtube if you have not seen it 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.080
 I'm going to leave you here a box 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.310
 so you can see it later, come back to this 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.010
 video this this trap this in this 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.230
 cheating this is very common in the 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.800
 football and in all aspects of the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.869
 life 2 the golden 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.730
 It reminded me a lot of a subject that I want 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.350
 to speak that is the lie and the deceit not 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.500
 from the moral point of view but from 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.070
 the point of view of the human being as a 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.930
 be smart as a being what 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 as part of his expression of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.090
 intelligence also has that part of the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.620
 deceit of lying are not very linear 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.110
 we have a part of which is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.660
 unconsciously or consciously deceive 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.300
 in fact psychologists when they analyze 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.350
 To a child 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.030
 when they are very small they analyze 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.600
 whenever they are 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.390
 what a lying liar is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.820
 and an expression of intelligence or more 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.940
 intelligence is when the child tends to 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.170
 be more invented over the internet 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.000
 Liar as would say Luis Perceptivo 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.680
 this and good and well the other aspects 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.860
 from ethical morals et cetera etcetera 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.500
 no but I feel that when you let that 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.000
 a child expresses and lives this every 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.450
 stage in adulthood that is with days in 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.690
 older and we will be able to see more maturity 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.090
 in that good aspect I told them I remembered 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.789
 of a match I was watching 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.619
 to cross grandfather if you do not know who he is 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.050
 the grandfather cross I'll leave you here 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.740
 Another clicked video came back 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.110
 again and see who is the cross grandfather 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.509
 this a great Mexican player is very 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.479
 interesting to watch in matches in the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.580
 games extinguishes a very nice play 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.310
 of more memory this one goal in the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.770
 selection when 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 he was left alone and he was hurt and he 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.550
 it was because of today's topic but I remember a 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.890
 game where was the grandfather cross the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.489
 referee was behind him a little bit of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.620
 back but I intuit intuito equipment 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.290
 flips of the mind at that time not what 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.890
 he watched as if out of the corner of his eye and the player 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.840
 or contrary was the closest was 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.470
 about two meters from 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.269
 distance but he made a scream that all the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 stadium was quiet made those who 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.680
 they were riding that they are turning them around 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.510
 to the other side was the ball that the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.670
 ball was not even there 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 they turned scared because they saw that 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.780
 it happened they are not rite 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.459
 I was really seeing him 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 because he was a player that you have to 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.090
 be watching the time and called a lot 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.890
 the attention plays very well run to that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.290
 show in what is good did 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.140
 when 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.799
 then high up the legs as if 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.540
 there would be nothing a kick and this and it comes out 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.730
 ejected the other player 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.500
 the referee fell redondito and in that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.480
 time in the nineties do not forget me 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.950
 it seems that there were moments this one had not 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.599
 so many cameras definitely in that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.800
 time there were not as many cameras as 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:23.650
 there is now and less with technology this 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 he lacked all this type of technology 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 with high speed which makes the 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.900
 slow motion be extreme not terrific 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.760
 Well, I just wanted to see what they think 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.849
 you get from the lie of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.970
 I think cheating is an intrinsic part 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.129
 of the human being and of course that certain 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.720
 moments with you fish for example to 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.840
 clinton bill or when they caught him with 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 with Monica lewinsky yesterday I was 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.560
 true watching a video that is here in 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.269
 youtube the moment he gives that he 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.180
 is giving the statements and they were 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.939
 in the video analyzing the verbal part and 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.890
 non-verbal of this matter is fine 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.730
 funny I remember a lot the guy from 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.390
 eight ' this when it says no 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.580
 when a teacher or something that always 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.950
 contradicted the head to what is 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.250
 expressing then when he is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.310
 saying 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.040
 I did not have relations with Monica Lewis 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 so he was very light movement 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.810
 what do you do but tell you what is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 signing no if I did not have sex 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.920
 communicate whiskey and this and 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.840
 and I swear I'm not cheating 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.080
 is very good to analyze it and that he 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.240
 is from the experts and is one of the best 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.129
 speak that documentary about expression not 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.949
 verbal 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.139
 of those that best come out in this analysis 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.319
 but still at that critical moment 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.169
 obviously with all the pressure because those 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.560
 small details that you see the law and 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.270
 good 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.270
 that has not deceived in that there is not 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.240
 thrown has made a lie this 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.160
 environment the first stone is not right 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.760
 you're a writer is smart up 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.880
 then 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.880
 bye
