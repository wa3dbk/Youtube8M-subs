just<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.110> our<00:01:46.290> Rosenfeld<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.490> isn't<00:01:47.910> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
just look at our Rosenfeld it isn't a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.800 
just look at our Rosenfeld it isn't a
static<00:01:48.420> picture<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.820> moment<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.570> time

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
static picture it is a moment in time

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.190 
static picture it is a moment in time
but<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> evolved<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.580> sense<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.240> movement<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but it evolved a sense of movement and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.399 
but it evolved a sense of movement and
power<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:57.060> drama<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:58.080> think

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
power it is that drama that I think

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.760 
power it is that drama that I think
they're<00:01:58.620> they're<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.130> good<00:01:59.370> at<00:01:59.520> catching
