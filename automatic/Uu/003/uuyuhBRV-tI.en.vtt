00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello, today's video will show how 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 make a box jammer 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.580
 but by the start of this video I would 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.280
 you would like to recommend the Khimki channel 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 the view near there will be a video in general 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.680
 boy shoots cool videos of you alone 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 homemade also from life hacking video very 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 interesting and quite a lot 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.460
 I myself enjoy watching his video in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.949
 Generally subscribe to his channel and we 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 Now we will do our wilderness so 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 let's start to make 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.320
 the box first will like the jammer 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 the box itself 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 no matter which one i took from cologne 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.210
 in our krovushki it was like this little thing in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 of course you can do without her but 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 will have to come up with something different in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 Generally find better in short here with this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 piece will also need a wing foil and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.110
 super moment moment or pencil without 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.770
 differences any glue and what we will 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 turn off my phone so let's 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 let's start for a start we need to expand here 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.200
 so here it is like this is difficult 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.250
 on this whole side glue foil 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.140
 on 2-3 layers that is we put we put glue and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.140
 sticking with foil let's get started 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.670
 and so in general the fact that I did 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.489
 I put equal to 3 layers on me no longer 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.870
 enough dancing the game ended and by the way 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.939
 best user there 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.420
 glue stick because it's too 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.659
 dear ends quickly and in general but 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.400
 principle glue normally but depends on 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.540
 the fact that you need to glue and finger 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.689
 glue better use was there that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.940
 That wants and earned it turned out 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.560
 now it is coherently all neatly 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.560
 don't break me 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:30.350
 We put in our box 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:34.070
 I think it will fit yes everything is fine but on 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.980
 the appearance of the box box by the way 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.870
 this part can still be glued covers 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.970
 so that when you open it like this 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.790
 didn't forgive 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.650
 Well, a moment of languages ​​and so now we will spend 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.580
 small test we will call from one 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.580
 phone to another 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.490
 how did you see everything works for a start I 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.690
 I'll show you here and made such a case 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.670
 no box is a case 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:24.570
 we will now put the phone in this case 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:29.550
 close let's allow for the same number and 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.550
 now and see how it works 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.410
 This as you can see this case works if 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.650
 do you want me to show you how 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.540

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.460
 I'll shoot a separate video about how 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.310
 make such a case but now let's 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.670
 check box jammers that we 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:26.980

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:29.400
 working we can close and call on 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.400
 This number 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:06:01.979
 and as you notice everything works fine 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.900
 even if we have a little boxes 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:09.780
