00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
thing about be skipping it's not about

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
thing about be skipping it's not about
the<00:00:50.550> kick-out<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> force<00:00:51.809> being

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

so<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.309> doing<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> B<00:00:59.760> square<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so when you're doing a B square me do a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
so when you're doing a B square me do a
quick<00:01:00.989> leg<00:01:01.350> drill<00:01:01.829> we're<00:01:02.640> trying<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.239> affect

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
quick leg drill we're trying to affect

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.359 
quick leg drill we're trying to affect
the<00:01:03.780> velocity<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> speed<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the velocity or the speed of the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.630 
the velocity or the speed of the
recovery<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:09.570> fast<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.170> recover<00:01:10.640> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
recovery how fast can we recover you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
recovery how fast can we recover you
know<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:13.130> recovery<00:01:14.130> cycle<00:01:15.110> how

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
know this is called a recovery cycle how

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
know this is called a recovery cycle how
fast<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.590> recover<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.310> working<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
fast can we recover so we're working on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
fast can we recover so we're working on
being<00:01:18.420> tall<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.009> recovering<00:01:20.009> recovering

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
being tall and recovering recovering

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
being tall and recovering recovering
recovering<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> doing<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.799> Q<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
recovering and doing that the Q is is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
recovering and doing that the Q is is
the<00:01:23.580> foot<00:01:23.820> always<00:01:24.119> comes<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.540> underneath

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the foot always comes back underneath

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.719 
the foot always comes back underneath
you<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> we're<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.490> trying

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you so when we do this we're not trying

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
you so when we do this we're not trying
to<00:01:26.759> stop<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.619> thinking

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to stop out here all we're thinking

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
to stop out here all we're thinking
about<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.100> bring<00:01:29.280> our<00:01:29.400> heel<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.759> letting<00:01:30.750> our

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
about is bring our heel up letting our

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.420 
about is bring our heel up letting our
hamstring<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.439> exposed<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> getting

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
hamstring be exposed here and getting

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
hamstring be exposed here and getting
our<00:01:32.520> foot<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.909> underneath<00:01:33.240> our<00:01:33.420> center<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
our foot back underneath our center of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
our foot back underneath our center of
mass<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.040> B<00:01:35.220> let's<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:37.040> quick<00:01:38.040> leg<00:01:38.220> let's<00:01:38.520> do

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
mass so B let's do a quick leg let's do

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
mass so B let's do a quick leg let's do
one<00:01:38.970> leg<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> left<00:01:40.079> leg<00:01:40.320> right

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
one leg you can do this left leg right

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
one leg you can do this left leg right
only<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.280> leg<00:01:41.490> only<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:42.270> different

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
only right leg only there's different

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
only right leg only there's different
combinations<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.920> left
