James and this looks very much like
hitch<00:02:27.329> light<00:02:28.079> but<00:02:28.680> hitch<00:02:28.890> made<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.159> lot<00:02:29.370> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
money so if this can make hitch light

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.319 
money so if this can make hitch light
money<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.739> think<00:02:32.129> will<00:02:32.280> Packer<00:02:32.519> Kevin<00:02:32.969> Hart<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
producer of prominently black comedies

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.229 
producer of prominently black comedies
up<00:02:47.010> until<00:02:47.219> this<00:02:47.310> point<00:02:47.370> also<00:02:47.760> some<00:02:48.030> black

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
up until this point also some black

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.960 
up until this point also some black
thrillers<00:02:48.659> such<00:02:48.989> as<00:02:49.230> no<00:02:49.650> good<00:02:49.859> deed<00:02:50.099> obsessed

takers<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.680> think<00:02:52.739> he's<00:02:53.010> doing<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.310> really

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
takers and I think he's doing a really

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.190 
takers and I think he's doing a really
good<00:02:53.700> job<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.329> he's<00:02:54.480> cornered<00:02:55.109> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
good job now that he's cornered that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.679 
good job now that he's cornered that
market<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.889> expanding<00:02:56.849> into<00:02:57.120> trying<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.540> get

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
decision because he's like well that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.490

worked<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:26.729> well<00:03:26.909> I<00:03:27.510> clearly<00:03:28.139> should<00:03:28.199> just

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
worked so well I clearly should just

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.319

keep<00:03:28.620> doing<00:03:28.979> that<00:03:29.129> or<00:03:29.849> maybe<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.239> the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
keep doing that or maybe if the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.059 
keep doing that or maybe if the

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
me usually comedians have to get to that

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.280 
me usually comedians have to get to that
point<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.019> Jim<00:04:07.319> Carrey<00:04:07.349> Robin<00:04:08.040> Williams<00:04:08.459> uh

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
point like Jim Carrey Robin Williams uh

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.509 
point like Jim Carrey Robin Williams uh
you<00:04:10.290> know<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.590> think<00:04:10.799> Kevin<00:04:10.949> Hart<00:04:11.220> might<00:04:11.370> be

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
you know and I think Kevin Hart might be

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.699 
you know and I think Kevin Hart might be
very<00:04:11.699> you<00:04:12.329> know<00:04:12.359> very<00:04:12.599> close<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.169> becoming<00:04:13.500> in

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
very you know very close to becoming in

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.890 
very you know very close to becoming in
that<00:04:13.859> same<00:04:14.129> category<00:04:14.239> he<00:04:15.239> might<00:04:15.419> play<00:04:15.659> himself

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
that same category he might play himself

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.810 
that same category he might play himself
out<00:04:16.259> very<00:04:16.470> quickly<00:04:16.650> because<00:04:16.949> he's<00:04:17.220> making<00:04:17.609> so

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
out very quickly because he's making so

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.789 
out very quickly because he's making so
many<00:04:17.940> films<00:04:18.299> he's<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.539> prolific<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.199> he<00:04:19.680> has

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
many films he's so prolific and he has

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.039 
many films he's so prolific and he has
as<00:04:20.009> I<00:04:20.250> discussed<00:04:21.120> him<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.299> think<00:04:21.479> like<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.630> man<00:04:21.840> to

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
as I discussed him I think like a man to

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.469 
as I discussed him I think like a man to
review<00:04:22.380> his<00:04:23.220> whole<00:04:23.490> persona<00:04:23.849> is<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.389> a

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
review his whole persona is that of a

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.659 
review his whole persona is that of a
manic<00:04:25.050> individual<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.099> I<00:04:26.130> think<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.490> might<00:04:26.639> be

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
manic individual so I think I might be

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.159 
manic individual so I think I might be
speeding<00:04:27.090> up<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.300> process<00:04:27.330> as<00:04:27.870> well<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
speeding up the process as well the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.589 
speeding up the process as well the
overexposure<00:04:28.710> process<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.430> we'll<00:04:29.580> see<00:04:29.820> so

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
overexposure process but we'll see so

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.390 
overexposure process but we'll see so
