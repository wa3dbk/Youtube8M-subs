00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.040
 so today it's about a shoulder and 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.960
 Although shoulder neck press shoulder 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.900
 at this device that is in the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.209
 shoulder press the device many 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.570
 maybe also from the multi press 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:25.119
 this optics or this is given and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.119
 we have specified the movement 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.990
 I'll show you an exercise now 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.130
 not count to my favorite exercise 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.309
 because I also want to shoulder 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.289
 in which programs I'm asked 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.969
 then about such discussions so 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.960
 So I'll show you this mine 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.510
 favorite my favorite program 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.579
 wondering how nice it was not like that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.859
 subjective because I get through it 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.809
 that I exaggerated such practice 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.150
 have in connection with martial arts me 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.010
 The shoulder times really hurt 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.810
 who ever problems with the shoulder 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 had and shoulder injuries knows that 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.250
 is about to kneel like that it depends on the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.970
 drag behind you that drag 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.750
 you maybe even okay with us 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.280
 make one here the one 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 Total shoulder muscle loses 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 that is, the shoulder musculature exists 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 from the front delta in the rear 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.270
 parents in the lateral muscle offender the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.190
 trapezoid eos and neck 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 that would be without the main participants 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.630
 had to move and the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.550
 You can move once in front of the chest 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 make and show you both offspring 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.190
 movements now only with the rod 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.210
 and who else to explain that ok 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.850
 you sit here upright with the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.610
 back can be fixed on the wall 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.920
 elapse 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.230
 It is always best to remove weight 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 your two training partners in such 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.120
 I always get this exercise 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.350
 because the here overstretched extremely 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.370
 the shoulder joint alone that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.080
 Lifting out is almost too healthy 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.670
 okay I go forward a bit rum is 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 lift to facilitate the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.200
 give me the po something forward then 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.990
 the weight rausstrecken back to the front 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.970
 Press on the back 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.260
 the weight include either the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 motion in the neck say it here and there 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.709
 I always like and up slowly 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.709
 deep 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.380
 never completely go through the arms 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.219
 slowly settle and move quickly upwards 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.349
 press or slowly condescend faster 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:42.439
 framework of the regulation or 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.599
 full breasts and body is almost exactly 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.909
 so they happen with everyone 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.909
 to the child and back up 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.819
 OK 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.800
 that was complicated exercise 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.250
 not the only thing here sometimes 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.500
 harder it can come in part 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.000
 also say that is just the highlight 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.440
 so that more weight has to work 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.350
 really take care of the shoulder 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.790
 there is already a lot 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.260
 This can happen a lot but is too 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.060
 a lot has happened you have the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.370
 possibility also the weight here in front 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.050
 to settle for sucking possibility 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.050
 demonstrated my wish 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.150
 that weight off me and then 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.720
 you go or in groups completely 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.720
 inspired 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.330
 working and what's going on set 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.840
 can 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.350
 yes, both options are there 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.060
 I can only recommend you if you are 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.830
 with the physiotherapist or one 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.440
 orthopedic sports and talked about such 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.850
 speak that will become you physicians 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.170
 probably say the movement behind 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.820
 it is not so good 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.310
 shoulder joints overstretched the 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.350
 Movements in front of the body is back 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.580
 better than okay is that important 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.560
 they perhaps do not elbow 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.600
 far after exhibited but with the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.610
 elbows so something more on the body 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.130
 works if you see me important 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.830
 make then I always take relatively far 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.860
 and the relatively tight and leave the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.870
 Elbows always closer to the inside 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.430
 Body and I show you that I almost 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.480
 not here for a little longer 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.730
 fits exactly and shoulder width presses 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.950
 the weight out when i'm against 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.950
 the l needs something closer to hinke 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.130
 so that's it shouldered few 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.960
 Questions about exercises you still have to ask 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.550
 are if you have questions then 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.830
 Just leave a comment 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.810
 under the video and we post 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.880
 regular renewal also to the shoulder 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
 program if you click through 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.750
 our football camps tv side I will 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.400
 a few more shoulder boys 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.680
 find if you have questions to others 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.680
 muscle groups just say it
