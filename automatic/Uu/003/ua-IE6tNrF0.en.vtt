think<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> speech<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.850> all

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
think the speech I think that was all

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
think the speech I think that was all
planned<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> cuff

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.420 
planned I don't think I was off the cuff
I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.650> hardball<00:01:13.950> knew<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.340> doing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
I think hardball knew what he was doing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
I think hardball knew what he was doing
by<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> rustling<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> fire<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little

got to go to Alex Smith and this is why

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.789 
got to go to Alex Smith and this is why
he's<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.420> starter<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
he's your starter if you go to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460 
he's your starter if you go to
Kaepernick<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.299> sit<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.810> Alex<00:01:37.229> Smith

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Kaepernick and you sit down Alex Smith

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
Kaepernick and you sit down Alex Smith
you're<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> wreck<00:01:38.159> his<00:01:38.460> confidence<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

you're going to wreck his confidence in
what<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.750> Alex<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.799> Kaepernick<00:01:41.130> bombs

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
what if Alex what if Kaepernick bombs

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
what if Alex what if Kaepernick bombs
then<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.649> guy
