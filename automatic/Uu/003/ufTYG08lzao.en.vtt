00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 what about cop I bring you another video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.990
 comparing where from your six the cable 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 from google that comes to bet the quality 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 of your smartphone made by Motorola that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 it's not affordable but now it's premium in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.359
 galaxy note 4 which is the latest in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 samsung in high range of the whole team 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.730
 of are on par with a minimum 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 difference in 24 is smaller and more 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.439
 thin that the nexus 6 but the 86 of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 take advantage of the margins since 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.540
 they have implemented a lot what they have 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 what to do with an engine or motorcycle x 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 second generation 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.980
 these teams weigh in 184 grams and 176 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 grams but with the quality of materials 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 in fact there is no problem 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.579
 sustaining what is reflected in these 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649
 teams on the screen the rumors 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.050
 they were true the nexus 6 with five 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.160
 points 96 inches google has put 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.739
 now to the tablets comparing with the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 5.7 of note 4 here it should be noted that the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180
 note 4 makes good use of margins 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.150
 of its screen is very compact for 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 make fable the resolution of the screen 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.100
 of equipment are 4 hd 2 that apparently 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.500
 will be the standard of the following 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 generations of mobile the kind of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.410
 4 screen is super amoled version the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 nec 26 that is amoled no doubt in the 4 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.070
 wins in this aspect has a great 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.740
 quality of colors and contrast of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.020
 black and white but the nacho 6 is not 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 is going to be left behind because its 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.200
 screen gives a lot of potential being ips 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 lcd in the processor both computers 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 they have qualcomm snapdragon 805 a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.550
 fair process manufactured for 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 rough resolution screens which is 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.110
 takes advantage of this and even more so with 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.619
 his three arrived and from here of each team 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.320
 with an adreno 420 gpu that offers better 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.360
 graphic quality technology this gpu 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 for new games that are more 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.130
 heavy and need a lot of great 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.300
 processor the nexus 6 will come out with the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.300
 new android 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.610
 lollipop 5.0 this great operating system 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.610
 and prepare a video talking about 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 lollipop 5.0 and its news 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.890
 android 4.44 kitkat that will be updated 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.630
 to android 5.0 after one or two 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 when some day not too far away so 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.850
 generally die between 3 to 6 months the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.390
 note 4 has a capacity of 32 gb 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.360
 expandable with micro sd up to 128 GB 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.570
 well in some colors also 86 32 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 gb and 64 gb but has no expansion of 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.090
 micro sd and comes in two colors the nexus 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.310
 6 arrives with a 3 megapixel camera 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.709
 with optical stabilization it takes very 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.650
 good photos with little luminosity the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.350
 note 4 a camera is smart today is 16 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.600
 megapixel takes very bright images 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.120
 with good resolution with very contrasts 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.070
 good at this point for me the camera 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.000
 the front camera of the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.610
 nexus 6 of 2 megapixels and the 94 of 3.7 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.860
 megapixels for that selfish in haiti 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.650
 both computers have a battery of 3 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.560
 thousand 220 thousand jobs only the nexus 6 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.209
 it's not removable and 24 is and that's it 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.290
 It's good as long as they have another 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.659
 battery of our autonomy 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.359
 is 24 hours has a system called 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.790
 turbo charge in just 15 minutes of 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.159
 charge you have to use at least six 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.469
 hours that's too cool in the 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.799
 nou 4 has something like a burden 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.409
 Fast for 30 minutes charging 50% 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.470
 of the battery but what I like the no 4 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.540
 is that samsung implemented the ultra mode 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.760
 energy saving that according to this one has 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.739
 very good reviews and comparisons of 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.459
 true that the battery is discharged very 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.180
 slow 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.760
 the price on samsung galaxy note 4 is 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.010
 850 in the USA 32-gig model 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.430
 international version and the nexus 6 a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.650
 32GB model of $ 649 is no longer 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.659
 nothing crazy that the links were 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.669
 an affordable price but now google has 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.310
 put so it's quality since 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.659
 it's a nexus 6 premium and good 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.090
 coleguitas that's all for the moment 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.010
 what then what do they choose to comment not 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.230
 be afraid I'm going by the nexus 6 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.030
 because I like the pure android with nothing 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.489
 of operational declamation personalization what 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.199
 It makes fluid faster elegant and more 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.940
 safe updates of the new 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.989
 operating systems that will come out in little 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.880
 weather 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.340
 to update immediately good
