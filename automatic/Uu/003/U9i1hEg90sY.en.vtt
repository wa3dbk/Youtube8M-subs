00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
area that I had to work with the vivo
allowed<00:00:33.450> me<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.469> much<00:00:34.829> more

latitude<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> designed<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> labels

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
latitude how I designed the labels

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
latitude how I designed the labels
before<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.980> would<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.550> small<00:00:38.700> section

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
before I would have just a small section

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
before I would have just a small section
of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> label<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.140> design<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.670> debo

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
of the label that I can design the debo

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
of the label that I can design the debo
allows<00:00:42.210> me<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> pretty<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.290> anything

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
allows me to do it pretty much anything

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.310 
allows me to do it pretty much anything
I<00:00:43.770> want<00:00:44.070> anywhere<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> plate<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:46.170> one

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

nice thing about the devo is able to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930 
nice thing about the devo is able to
produce<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.450> high<00:00:48.510> quality<00:00:49.050> labels<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
produce very high quality labels and I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
produce very high quality labels and I
like<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:52.020> designer<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> labels<00:00:53.340> make<00:00:53.550> a

I<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.430> setting<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.330> vivo<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.990> I

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
I have a setting on the vivo that I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.020 
I have a setting on the vivo that I
could<00:01:24.200> put<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> matte<00:01:24.830> black<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:25.640> even

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
could put to a matte black so even

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.120 
could put to a matte black so even
though<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.450> black<00:01:26.720> color<00:01:27.020> on<00:01:27.290> my<00:01:27.440> screen<00:01:27.800> I

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
though it's a black color on my screen I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.030 
though it's a black color on my screen I
could<00:01:28.610> make<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.940> vivo<00:01:29.690> print<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.650> what<00:01:30.950> it

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
could make the vivo print and what it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.820 
could make the vivo print and what it
looks<00:01:31.190> like<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.400> chalkboard<00:01:31.700> little<00:01:32.830> chop

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
looks like a chalkboard little chop

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.350 
looks like a chalkboard little chop
reminisce<00:01:34.400> around<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.790> edges<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.300> stuff

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
reminisce around the edges and stuff

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.420 
reminisce around the edges and stuff
like<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:36.080> so<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.770> actually<00:01:37.040> on<00:01:37.400> the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
like that and so it actually on the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.030 
like that and so it actually on the
bottom<00:01:37.850> looks<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.570> real<00:01:38.750> chalkboard<00:01:39.320> we

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
bottom looks like the real chalkboard we

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.850 
bottom looks like the real chalkboard we
proofed<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> labels<00:01:40.910> as<00:01:41.150> they<00:01:41.420> come<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:41.860> if

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
proofed the labels as they come out if

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.160 
proofed the labels as they come out if
it's<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.160> very<00:01:43.370> large<00:01:43.670> run<00:01:44.060> we'll<00:01:44.750> look<00:01:44.780> at<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
it's a very large run we'll look at the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.020 
it's a very large run we'll look at the
first<00:01:45.410> few<00:01:45.650> labels<00:01:45.890> make<00:01:46.370> sure<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
first few labels make sure that the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.330 
first few labels make sure that the
color<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.360> consistent<00:01:48.200> extra<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.740> alignment

color is consistent extra be alignment

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
color is consistent extra be alignment
up<00:01:49.460> within<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.030> label<00:01:50.390> is<00:01:50.479> consistent<00:01:51.080> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
up within the label is consistent and

up within the label is consistent and
then<00:01:51.920> we<00:01:52.040> can<00:01:52.190> pretty<00:01:52.460> much<00:01:52.550> walk<00:01:52.910> away<00:01:53.180> and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
then we can pretty much walk away and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.270 
then we can pretty much walk away and
let<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.690> labels<00:01:54.080> print<00:01:54.440> we<00:01:54.740> use<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.040> vivo

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
is to having a whole Bank of the vivos

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.610 
is to having a whole Bank of the vivos
to<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.820> run<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.420> same<00:02:20.600> time<00:02:20.870> right<00:02:21.350> now<00:02:21.560> we

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
to be run at the same time right now we

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.340 
to be run at the same time right now we
only<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.430> vivo<00:02:23.239> which<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.660> limiting<00:02:24.110> us

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
only have one vivo which is limiting us

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.009

and<00:02:24.560> how<00:02:24.650> much<00:02:24.770> labels<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.000> produce<00:02:26.209> we

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
and how much labels we can produce we

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.810 
and how much labels we can produce we
have<00:02:27.200> their<00:02:27.350> orders<00:02:27.530> stacked<00:02:27.980> up<00:02:28.220> behind<00:02:28.550> it
