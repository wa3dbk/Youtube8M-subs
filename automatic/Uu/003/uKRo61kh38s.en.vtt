little different than our other brake
line<00:00:42.660> kits<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.469> actually

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
line kits because there are actually

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000 
line kits because there are actually

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you need and they look great so they're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200 
you need and they look great so they're
DLT<00:01:03.930> approved<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> important

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
DLT approved that's kind of important

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.320 
DLT approved that's kind of important
and<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.200> fit<00:01:07.530> pretty<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.580> every<00:01:08.790> corner

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and they fit pretty much on every corner

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
and they fit pretty much on every corner
so<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.200> help<00:01:10.500> prevent<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> brake<00:01:11.189> fade<00:01:11.460> they

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
so these help prevent a brake fade they

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
so these help prevent a brake fade they
also<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.049> lifted<00:01:13.470> JK<00:01:13.830> regulars<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> these

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
can put them on stock jeeps but you may

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.680 
can put them on stock jeeps but you may
have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.659> route<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> lines<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.320> little
