amen<00:00:01.199> alignment<00:00:01.890> things<00:00:02.730> that<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.000> think<00:00:03.149> are

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
amen alignment things that I think are

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.329 
amen alignment things that I think are
heavily<00:00:03.929> overlooked<00:00:04.589> when<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.890> comes<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
heavily overlooked when it comes to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.760 
heavily overlooked when it comes to
instruction<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.779> want<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.319> go<00:00:07.470> through<00:00:07.680> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
instruction so I want to go through a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.709 
instruction so I want to go through a
routine<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.429> will<00:00:08.580> help<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.000> aim<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.420> align

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
routine that will help you aim and align

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.499 
routine that will help you aim and align
yourself<00:00:10.200> correctly<00:00:11.010> every<00:00:11.580> time<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
yourself correctly every time one of the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.650 
yourself correctly every time one of the
major<00:00:12.780> problems<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.710> amateurs<00:00:14.219> face<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
major problems that amateurs face is the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.710 
major problems that amateurs face is the
mistake<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.109> aiming<00:00:17.070> their<00:00:17.520> body<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
mistake of aiming their body at the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650 
mistake of aiming their body at the
target<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.380> well<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> clubface<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
target as well as the clubface so this

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
target as well as the clubface so this
is<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> cause<00:00:22.369> compensations<00:00:23.369> from<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
is going to cause compensations from the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.470 
is going to cause compensations from the
get-go<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.109> behind<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:26.070> ball<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.269> want

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
get-go so get behind the ball and I want

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
get-go so get behind the ball and I want
you<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.630> visualize<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.590> line<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.369> straight

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you to visualize a line going straight

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
you to visualize a line going straight
from<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> ball<00:00:30.570> through<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> target<00:00:31.439> I've

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
from the ball through to the target I've

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
from the ball through to the target I've
put<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> alignment<00:00:33.030> rod<00:00:33.210> down<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.719> front<00:00:33.989> so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
put the alignment rod down in front so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540 
put the alignment rod down in front so
that<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> nice<00:00:34.920> visual<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that you can get a nice visual of that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
that you can get a nice visual of that
here<00:00:36.270> today<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> want<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> visualize

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
here today then I want you to visualize

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000 
here today then I want you to visualize
a<00:00:38.730> line<00:00:39.000> parallel<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.860> right

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a line parallel to that so for right

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.479 
a line parallel to that so for right
handers<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:42.110> parallel<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.309> your

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
handers left parallel that is for your

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.330 
handers left parallel that is for your
feet<00:00:44.969> hips<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> shoulders<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.590> we're<00:00:47.129> working

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
feet hips and shoulders so we're working

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.600 
feet hips and shoulders so we're working
our<00:00:47.700> club<00:00:48.149> head<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:49.050> arc<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
our club head on an arc so we need to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
our club head on an arc so we need to
have<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:51.030> parallel<00:00:51.449> lines<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.289> order<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> help

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
have two parallel lines in order to help

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.970 
have two parallel lines in order to help
us<00:00:53.399> best<00:00:53.969> square<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> clubface<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.410> impact

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
us best square that clubface at impact

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.709 
us best square that clubface at impact
okay<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.600> you're

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
okay so that's the first thing you're

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
okay so that's the first thing you're
going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.050> second<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
going to do second thing you're going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540 
going to do second thing you're going to
do<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> aim<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.359> clubface<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.980> easiest

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
do is aim the clubface so it's easiest

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.399 
do is aim the clubface so it's easiest
if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> pick<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.989> spot<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:05.339> between<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> ball

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
if you pick a spot in between the ball

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
if you pick a spot in between the ball
and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.770> target<00:01:08.220> something<00:01:08.490> close<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and the target something close as a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960 
and the target something close as a
reference<00:01:10.290> point<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.610> tee

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reference point so if I put this tee

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
reference point so if I put this tee
just<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> few<00:01:12.900> feet<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.409> front<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.729> ball

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
just a few feet in front of my ball

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990 
just a few feet in front of my ball
there<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:16.080> easier<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.640> place

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
there it's much easier for me to place

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
there it's much easier for me to place
that<00:01:18.299> clubface<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.560> tee<00:01:19.770> aiming<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that clubface at the tee aiming at the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
that clubface at the tee aiming at the
tee<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:21.299> only<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.570> few<00:01:21.810> feet<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.229> front

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
tee that's only a few feet in front

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.760 
tee that's only a few feet in front
instead<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> 300<00:01:23.549> yards<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.659> fairway<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
instead of 300 yards down the fairway so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
instead of 300 yards down the fairway so
that<00:01:25.950> clubface<00:01:26.340> should<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.729> perfectly

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that clubface should be perfectly

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
that clubface should be perfectly
perpendicular<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.860> target<00:01:29.310> line<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
perpendicular to the target line it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
perpendicular to the target line it
doesn't<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.479> matter<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.170> enter<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
doesn't really matter how you enter the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
doesn't really matter how you enter the
site<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> hitting<00:01:33.150> zone<00:01:33.270> Jack<00:01:33.960> Nicklaus<00:01:34.320> used

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
site the hitting zone Jack Nicklaus used

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
site the hitting zone Jack Nicklaus used
to<00:01:34.680> walk<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> aim<00:01:35.729> his<00:01:35.939> clubface<00:01:36.450> first

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to walk in and aim his clubface first

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
to walk in and aim his clubface first
and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.740> look<00:01:37.979> after<00:01:38.369> his<00:01:38.520> feet<00:01:38.820> hips<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and then look after his feet hips and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
and then look after his feet hips and
shoulders<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> parallel<00:01:40.439> line<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
shoulders on that parallel line a lot of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.850 
shoulders on that parallel line a lot of
other<00:01:41.610> golfers<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.360> Lee<00:01:43.170> Jansen

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
other golfers out there Lee Jansen

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
other golfers out there Lee Jansen
plenty<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> others<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> point<00:01:45.540> system<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
plenty of others do the point system so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.859 
plenty of others do the point system so
they<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:47.100> draw<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> line<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.060> point<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
they actually draw a line and point to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
they actually draw a line and point to
get<00:01:49.020> their<00:01:49.200> target<00:01:49.409> line<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.979> place<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.909> they

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
get their target line in place then they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.719 
get their target line in place then they
visualize<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.960> parallel<00:01:52.619> line<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.399> feet

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
visualize that parallel line with feet

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.179
