talk about some of those mechanical keys
as<00:00:16.370> to<00:00:16.610> how<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:17.359> generate<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:18.230> velocity<00:00:19.240> for

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
as to how you generate that velocity for

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.320 
as to how you generate that velocity for
me<00:00:20.359> I<00:00:20.390> think<00:00:20.570> it<00:00:21.050> goes<00:00:21.260> into<00:00:22.000> you<00:00:23.000> know<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.210> lot

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
how you really achieve that balance

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.279 
how you really achieve that balance
because<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.760> know<00:00:58.820> it's<00:00:59.059> something<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.510> you'll

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
because I know it's something you you'll

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.689 
because I know it's something you you'll
be<00:01:00.440> working<00:01:00.769> on<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.039> rest<00:01:01.219> of<00:01:01.370> your<00:01:01.519> career

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
but staying balanced and over the road

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.380 
but staying balanced and over the road
yeah<00:01:03.739> I<00:01:03.920> think<00:01:04.190> for<00:01:04.400> me<00:01:04.550> I<00:01:04.580> think<00:01:04.940> sometimes

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
yeah I think for me I think sometimes

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.780 
yeah I think for me I think sometimes
where<00:01:05.660> I<00:01:05.690> getting<00:01:05.960> into<00:01:06.110> trouble<00:01:06.410> is<00:01:06.740> my<00:01:07.460> foot

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
where I getting into trouble is my foot

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.480 
where I getting into trouble is my foot
will<00:01:07.970> open<00:01:08.330> up<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.890> little<00:01:09.890> bit<00:01:10.040> almost<00:01:10.160> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
will open up a little bit almost a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.940 
will open up a little bit almost a
second<00:01:10.880> base<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.540> kind<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.380> keeps<00:01:12.650> my

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
second base and that kind of keeps my

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.910 
second base and that kind of keeps my
angle<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.700> line<00:01:14.480> towards<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.380> right-handed

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
angle and line towards the right-handed

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.650 
angle and line towards the right-handed
batters<00:01:16.280> boxes<00:01:16.730> for<00:01:16.940> me<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.060> really<00:01:17.480> need<00:01:17.630> to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
batters boxes for me I really need to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.180 
batters boxes for me I really need to
stay<00:01:18.050> almost<00:01:19.040> open<00:01:20.170> almost<00:01:21.170> open<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.920> to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
stay almost open almost open to the to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.160 
stay almost open almost open to the to
the<00:01:22.280> third<00:01:22.460> base<00:01:22.670> side<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.180> then<00:01:23.660> when<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:23.840> come

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the third base side and then when I come

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.430 
the third base side and then when I come
up<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.680> really<00:01:25.190> try<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.490> get<00:01:25.870> you<00:01:26.870> know<00:01:26.990> my<00:01:27.170> foot

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
up I really try and get you know my foot

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.650 
up I really try and get you know my foot
almost<00:01:27.830> across<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.310> little<00:01:28.760> bit<00:01:28.910> that<00:01:29.180> way<00:01:29.360> I

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
almost across a little bit that way I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.780 
almost across a little bit that way I
can<00:01:30.230> really<00:01:30.410> stay<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.740> line<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.250> plate<00:01:31.430> and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
can really stay in line to the plate and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.420 
can really stay in line to the plate and
then<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.630> know<00:01:32.690> at<00:01:32.990> dry<00:01:33.860> when<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.070> drive

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
then that you know at dry when I drive

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.890 
then that you know at dry when I drive
and<00:01:34.730> use<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.030> slope<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.450> mound<00:01:35.660> I'm

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
and use the slope of the mound I'm

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.250 
and use the slope of the mound I'm
really<00:01:36.440> here<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.040> I'm<00:01:37.130> trying<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.700> stay<00:01:38.300> this
