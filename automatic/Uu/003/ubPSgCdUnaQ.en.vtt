00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
better than someone's handwriting or

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.020 
better than someone's handwriting or
something<00:04:50.979> like<00:04:51.039> that<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.280> don't<00:04:51.400> mind<00:04:51.760> it<00:04:51.940> I

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
something like that I don't mind it I

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.090 
something like that I don't mind it I
know<00:04:52.090> it's<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.510> an<00:04:52.630> official<00:04:53.020> thing<00:04:53.229> it's

know it's like an official thing it's

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.620 
know it's like an official thing it's
probably<00:04:54.220> when<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.669> store<00:04:54.940> got<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.419> for

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
probably when the store got it for

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.909 
probably when the store got it for
whatever<00:04:55.780> reason<00:04:56.199> back<00:04:56.320> then<00:04:56.500> I'm<00:04:56.620> not<00:04:56.770> sure

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
whatever reason back then I'm not sure

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.520 
whatever reason back then I'm not sure
maybe<00:04:57.070> somebody<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:58.139> elaborate<00:04:59.139> in<00:04:59.350> the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
maybe somebody can elaborate in the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.710 
maybe somebody can elaborate in the
comments<00:05:00.010> why<00:05:00.580> they<00:05:00.699> used<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.970> stamp<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.479> date

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
comments why they used to stamp the date

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.200 
comments why they used to stamp the date
you<00:05:01.990> know<00:05:02.080> for<00:05:02.350> whatever<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:03.460> know<00:05:03.580> they<00:05:04.030> know

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
you know for whatever you know they know

when<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.449> came<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.780> guess<00:05:04.930> when<00:05:05.050> they<00:05:05.139> sent

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
when it came in I guess when they sent

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.980 
when it came in I guess when they sent
it<00:05:05.500> back<00:05:05.650> if<00:05:05.860> they<00:05:05.979> had<00:05:06.070> extras<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.900> don't<00:05:07.900> know

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
it back if they had extras I don't know

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.940 
it back if they had extras I don't know
