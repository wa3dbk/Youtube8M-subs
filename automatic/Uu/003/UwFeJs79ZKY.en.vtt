given time and this is the day before
this<00:00:45.809> monster<00:00:46.469> supposed<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.750> come<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:48.989> our

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this monster supposed to come into our

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.510 
this monster supposed to come into our
system<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> close<00:00:50.760> approach<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> earth

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
system or it's close approach to earth

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
system or it's close approach to earth
now<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> big<00:00:54.620> object<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.710> I'm

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
now it's not the big object that I'm

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
now it's not the big object that I'm
worried<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.280> its<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> disturbance<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.719> can

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
worried about its the disturbance it can

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
worried about its the disturbance it can
cause<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.559> objects<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.550> said

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
cause to other objects and like I said

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
cause to other objects and like I said
they<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.090> found<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:01.079> close<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
they just found this one very close it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.590 
they just found this one very close it's
things<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> keep<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.510> eye

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
things like that you got to keep an eye

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.859 
things like that you got to keep an eye
on<00:01:04.369> speaking<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> fireballs<00:01:05.939> we've<00:01:06.240> had<00:01:06.510> two

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
on speaking of fireballs we've had two

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
on speaking of fireballs we've had two
comets<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.650> least<00:01:08.479> approach<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.750> Sun<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.430> get

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
comets at least approach the Sun and get

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.380 
comets at least approach the Sun and get
disintegrated<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> process<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
disintegrated in the process I want to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
disintegrated in the process I want to
go<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.930> point<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.830> here

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
go through here and point out right here

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
go through here and point out right here
if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> pay<00:01:17.640> attention<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.509> small

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
if you pay attention it's very small

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
if you pay attention it's very small
you're<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> first<00:01:20.610> comet

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you're going to see the first comet

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.670 
you're going to see the first comet
track<00:01:21.600> its<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:24.680> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
track its way right up through here you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.910 
track its way right up through here you
can<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> moving<00:01:26.960> ever<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.110> slightly<00:01:28.650> there

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
can see it moving ever so slightly there

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
can see it moving ever so slightly there
now<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> other<00:01:29.850> view<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
now I'm going to go to the other view so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
now I'm going to go to the other view so
you<00:01:30.990> guys<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> watch<00:01:32.420> once<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you guys can see it watch once that

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.429 
you guys can see it watch once that
comet<00:01:34.110> gets<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.680> boom<00:01:36.200> backside<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
comet gets in there boom backside of the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.280 
comet gets in there boom backside of the
Sun<00:01:37.680> blown<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.780> classic

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.190 

now<00:01:45.860> roughly<00:01:46.160> two<00:01:46.490> days<00:01:46.670> later<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.390> same<00:01:47.660> area

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
now roughly two days later the same area

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.110 
now roughly two days later the same area
the<00:01:48.860> first<00:01:49.160> one<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> just<00:01:49.490> showed<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.820> was<00:01:50.030> on

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
the first one I just showed you was on

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.470 
the first one I just showed you was on
the<00:01:50.210> 24th<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.950> 26th<00:01:52.670> going<00:01:53.180> into<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
the 24th this is the 26th going into the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.470 
the 24th this is the 26th going into the
27th<00:01:54.370> keep<00:01:55.370> an<00:01:55.490> eye<00:01:55.580> right<00:01:55.790> there<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.270> see

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
27th keep an eye right there you can see

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.880 
27th keep an eye right there you can see
him<00:01:56.630> marching<00:01:57.050> his<00:01:57.290> way<00:01:57.470> up<00:02:00.640> toward<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.670> Sun

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
him marching his way up toward the Sun

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.240 
him marching his way up toward the Sun
going<00:02:03.890> right<00:02:04.280> up<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.610> same<00:02:04.970> path<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:06.250> not

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
going right up that same path and not

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.720 
going right up that same path and not
long<00:02:07.520> after<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.960> comet<00:02:09.380> gets<00:02:09.530> up<00:02:09.830> there<00:02:12.730> we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
long after the comet gets up there we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.250 
long after the comet gets up there we
see<00:02:14.000> an<00:02:14.120> explosion<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.960> Sun<00:02:17.050> will<00:02:18.050> take<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
see an explosion on the Sun will take a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.720 
see an explosion on the Sun will take a
look<00:02:18.860> here<00:02:18.890> at<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:21.290> closer<00:02:21.650> angle<00:02:22.190> i<00:02:22.340> watch

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
look here at a closer angle i watch

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.380 
look here at a closer angle i watch
right<00:02:23.270> there<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.550> will<00:02:25.670> see<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.000> first<00:02:26.270> one

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
right there you will see the first one

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.640 
right there you will see the first one
come<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.700> boom<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.040> that's<00:02:32.080> March<00:02:33.080> 24th

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
come in and boom and that's March 24th
