this<00:01:15.770> wallet<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.359> it's<00:01:17.899> Daisy<00:01:18.439> French<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.369> I

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
this wallet and it's Daisy French and I

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.950 
this wallet and it's Daisy French and I
don't<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:19.909> anything<00:01:20.299> that's<00:01:20.689> like<00:01:20.810> a

don't have anything that's like a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.130 
don't have anything that's like a
syringe<00:01:21.469> so<00:01:22.219> I<00:01:22.579> think<00:01:22.969> this<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.270> super<00:01:23.719> -<00:01:23.929> and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
syringe so I think this is super - and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.380 
syringe so I think this is super - and
the<00:01:24.229> spot<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.130> like<00:01:28.539> and<00:01:29.539> this<00:01:30.319> was<00:01:30.850> 1690<00:01:31.850> so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
the spot it's like and this was 1690 so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.539 
the spot it's like and this was 1690 so
I<00:01:32.420> mean<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:32.929> is<00:01:33.109> super<00:01:33.560> cute<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.039> I<00:01:34.310> actually

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
I mean this is super cute and I actually

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.330 
I mean this is super cute and I actually
already<00:01:35.119> figured<00:01:35.569> out<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.689> way<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:36.170> style<00:01:37.009> this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340
