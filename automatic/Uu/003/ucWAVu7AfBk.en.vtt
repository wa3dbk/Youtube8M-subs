just flat if you can see that it just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
just flat if you can see that it just
goes<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> half<00:00:48.840> pipe<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.289> goes<00:00:49.320> down<00:00:49.739> and

maybe even some advanced truly nice for
sliding<00:01:57.500> i<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.920> recommend<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.729> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
sliding i would recommend it and it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.280 
sliding i would recommend it and it's
not<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:00.299> expensive<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> hundred

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
not too expensive it's like a hundred

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.609 
not too expensive it's like a hundred
twenty<00:02:01.770> dollars

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
twenty dollars

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.249 
twenty dollars
it's<00:02:03.619> really<00:02:03.799> nice<00:02:04.070> board<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.899> prefer<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.170> over

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
it's really nice board I prefer it over

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.070 
it's really nice board I prefer it over
my<00:02:06.530> kills<00:02:06.799> make<00:02:07.009> for<00:02:07.189> sliding<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.969> just<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:08.959> it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
my kills make for sliding I just like it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.869 
my kills make for sliding I just like it
better<00:02:09.229> because<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.649> shorter<00:02:10.069> easier<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.759> me

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
better because it shorter easier for me

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.420 
better because it shorter easier for me
to<00:02:10.910> maneuver<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.080> yeah<00:02:12.650> that's<00:02:12.890> my<00:02:13.069> review<00:02:13.220> on
