it's<00:03:43.760> many-faceted<00:03:44.890> it's<00:03:45.969> exciting<00:03:47.469> but<00:03:48.469> I

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
it's many-faceted it's exciting but I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
it's many-faceted it's exciting but I
think<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.150> getting<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.750> those<00:03:51.139> feel

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
think it's getting there those feel

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.410 
think it's getting there those feel
fairly<00:03:52.310> marginal<00:03:53.139> in<00:03:54.139> terms<00:03:54.439> of<00:03:54.680> an<00:03:54.799> art<00:03:55.099> form

merchants<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.879> then<00:04:05.239> in<00:04:05.359> fact<00:04:05.629> within<00:04:05.870> the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
merchants and then in fact within the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.050 
merchants and then in fact within the
whole<00:04:06.379> melee<00:04:07.129> of<00:04:07.280> dance<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.939> it's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
whole melee of dance and it's

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.110 
whole melee of dance and it's
independent<00:04:08.870> consumer<00:04:09.260> exams<00:04:09.760> but<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.790> think

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
independent consumer exams but I think

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.490 
independent consumer exams but I think
it's<00:04:11.269> very<00:04:12.200> accessible<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:15.940> small<00:04:16.940> steps

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
it's very accessible so I small steps

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.219 
it's very accessible so I small steps
each<00:04:18.500> stone<00:04:19.099> cleared<00:04:19.669> out<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.269> way<00:04:20.509> and

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
each stone cleared out of the way and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.800 
each stone cleared out of the way and
that's<00:04:21.470> almost<00:04:21.979> twenty<00:04:22.460> years<00:04:22.490> of<00:04:23.150> clearing

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
that's almost twenty years of clearing

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.700 
that's almost twenty years of clearing
and<00:04:24.580> slowly<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:28.759> will<00:04:28.970> get<00:04:29.150> there<00:04:29.389> for<00:04:30.380> maybe

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
and slowly it will get there for maybe

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.999 
and slowly it will get there for maybe
we're<00:04:31.070> there<00:04:31.340> for<00:04:31.610> who<00:04:32.240> knows<00:04:32.509> if<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.740> think

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
we're there for who knows if I think

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.909 
we're there for who knows if I think
that<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.789> just<00:04:35.090> like<00:04:35.449> alive<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.470> just<00:04:36.740> keep

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
that is just like alive and just keep

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.339 
that is just like alive and just keep
doing<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.610> that's<00:04:37.789> independent

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
doing it and that's independent

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.529 
doing it and that's independent
contemporary<00:04:39.349> dance<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.210> if

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
contemporary dance and if you if

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.200 
contemporary dance and if you if
somebody<00:04:42.020> stops<00:04:42.500> doing<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:43.039> then<00:04:43.909> it's<00:04:44.120> not

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
somebody stops doing it then it's not

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:53.990 
somebody stops doing it then it's not
any<00:04:44.510> more<00:04:44.720> independent

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.720 

I<00:04:56.630> really<00:04:57.630> want<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.110> do<00:04:58.530> something<00:04:58.950> but

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
I really want to do something but

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.790 
I really want to do something but
perhaps<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.480> more<00:05:00.660> important<00:05:01.170> question<00:05:01.320> that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
perhaps the more important question that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.120 
perhaps the more important question that
you're<00:05:01.950> asking<00:05:01.980> me<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:03.300> what<00:05:03.570> my<00:05:03.840> body<00:05:04.140> for<00:05:04.860> my
