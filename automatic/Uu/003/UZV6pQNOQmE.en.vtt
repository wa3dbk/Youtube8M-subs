make a 30-pound jump in a couple couple

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
make a 30-pound jump in a couple couple
months<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:58.910> pretty<00:00:59.910> good<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:01.320> I

usually do with the slingshot for me on
the<00:01:04.710> max<00:01:04.949> days<00:01:05.250> I'll<00:01:06.180> work<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.810> max

building your meat in your head and your
training<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
training kind of like that's one of the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
training kind of like that's one of the
things<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:05.969> make<00:02:06.750> my

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
things that I like to do is make my

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.479 
things that I like to do is make my
training<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> meat<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.250> can

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
training as much like a meat as I can

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.770 
training as much like a meat as I can
especially<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.959> my<00:02:10.229> attempts<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
especially on my attempts like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.630 
especially on my attempts like
you<00:02:11.990> know<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> take<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.650> executives<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.550> my

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know I take the executives on my

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.730 
you know I take the executives on my
heavy<00:02:13.850> days<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.390> will<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.380> warmup

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
heavy days that I will in the warmup

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.090 
heavy days that I will in the warmup
room<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.459> start<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.050> guess<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:18.890> way<00:02:19.040> to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
room just start I guess it's one way to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.860 
room just start I guess it's one way to
make<00:02:19.310> your<00:02:19.459> training<00:02:19.910> more<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> meet<00:02:20.660> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
make your training more like a meet and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.480 
make your training more like a meet and
to<00:02:21.319> make<00:02:21.470> your<00:02:21.650> meat<00:02:21.800> more<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.190> training

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
to make your meat more like training

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.010 
to make your meat more like training
that's<00:02:23.090> been<00:02:23.330> something<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:23.690> really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
that's been something that's really

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.449 
that's been something that's really
helped<00:02:24.319> me<00:02:24.410> mentally<00:02:25.630> second<00:02:26.630> thing<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.459> don't

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
helped me mentally second thing I don't

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.729 
helped me mentally second thing I don't
use<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.760> very<00:02:28.880> much<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.360> speed<00:02:29.660> day<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.620> my

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
use it very much on speed day but on my

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.880 
use it very much on speed day but on my
rep<00:02:31.010> day<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:32.150> I've<00:02:32.330> got<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> designated<00:02:33.350> set<00:02:33.650> of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
rep day if I've got a designated set of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.059 
rep day if I've got a designated set of
say<00:02:34.819> three<00:02:35.090> sets<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.420> three<00:02:35.720> or<00:02:35.959> three<00:02:36.739> sets<00:02:36.980> of

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
say three sets of three or three sets of

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.970 
say three sets of three or three sets of
five<00:02:37.280> something<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.090> i<00:02:38.739> might<00:02:39.739> do<00:02:39.890> an

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
five something like that i might do an

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.050 
five something like that i might do an
additional<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.090> two<00:02:41.270> sets<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.890> an<00:02:43.640> extra

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
additional one to two sets with an extra

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.259 
additional one to two sets with an extra
quarter<00:02:44.300> maybe<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.470> know<00:02:45.590> extra<00:02:45.980> 30<00:02:46.730> pounds

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
quarter maybe you know extra 30 pounds

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.220 
quarter maybe you know extra 30 pounds
something<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.959> know<00:02:51.080> doing

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
something like that and you know doing

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.100 
something like that and you know doing
another<00:02:51.530> Center<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.459> slingshot<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
another Center to with the slingshot the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.490 
another Center to with the slingshot the
reason<00:02:54.410> i<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> slingshot<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.519> much

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
reason i like the slingshot so much

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.890 
reason i like the slingshot so much
versus<00:02:57.500> others<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:58.040> because<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.390> slingshot

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
versus others is because the slingshot

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.720 
versus others is because the slingshot
actually<00:03:00.319> gives<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.680> an<00:03:00.800> allowable<00:03:01.310> range

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
actually gives you an allowable range

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.790 
actually gives you an allowable range
without<00:03:02.630> hindering<00:03:03.140> your<00:03:03.350> range<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.739> motion

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
without hindering your range of motion

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.970 
without hindering your range of motion
and<00:03:04.340> your<00:03:05.030> technique<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.720> what<00:03:06.680> i<00:03:06.709> mean<00:03:06.800> by

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
and your technique and what i mean by

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
and your technique and what i mean by
that<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.569> you're<00:03:08.569> not<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:09.019> handling

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that is you're not going to be handling

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.090 
that is you're not going to be handling
you<00:03:10.160> know<00:03:10.310> 100<00:03:10.790> 120<00:03:11.420> pounds<00:03:11.750> over<00:03:12.140> what<00:03:13.069> you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
you know 100 120 pounds over what you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.390 
you know 100 120 pounds over what you
can<00:03:13.400> handle<00:03:13.519> raw<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.840> nice<00:03:15.019> bump<00:03:15.470> into

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
can handle raw so it's a nice bump into

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
can handle raw so it's a nice bump into
the<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.670> what<00:03:17.239> they<00:03:17.329> call<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.600> future

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the like what they call the future

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.860 
the like what they call the future
method<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:19.549> know<00:03:19.670> if<00:03:19.790> I'm<00:03:19.910> Benjen<00:03:20.209> 500<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.840> day

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
method you know if I'm Benjen 500 a day

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.979 
method you know if I'm Benjen 500 a day
raw<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.030> not<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.510> slingshot

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
raw and not going to use the slingshot

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.340 
raw and not going to use the slingshot
to<00:03:24.140> get<00:03:24.290> 5<00:03:24.530> 35<00:03:25.100> 45<00:03:25.610> 50<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:27.049> starts

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
to get 5 35 45 50 that starts

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.020 
to get 5 35 45 50 that starts
acclimating<00:03:27.950> my<00:03:28.070> body<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.579> holding<00:03:28.880> that

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
acclimating my body to holding that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.210 
acclimating my body to holding that
weight<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:30.049> actually<00:03:30.200> allows<00:03:30.470> my<00:03:30.920> body

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
weight and it actually allows my body

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.310 
weight and it actually allows my body
position<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.880> stay<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.450> actual<00:03:32.810> position

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
position to stay in the actual position

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.289 
position to stay in the actual position
that<00:03:33.440> I'll<00:03:33.530> be<00:03:33.650> pressing<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.940> future

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
that I'll be pressing in in the future

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.319 
that I'll be pressing in in the future
and<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.890> gets<00:03:37.040> my<00:03:37.190> body<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.730> my<00:03:37.790> mind<00:03:37.910> ready

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
and it gets my body and my mind ready

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.000 
and it gets my body and my mind ready
for<00:03:38.420> those<00:03:38.660> repetitions<00:03:38.930> without<00:03:39.590> changing

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
for those repetitions without changing

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.690 
for those repetitions without changing
things<00:03:40.280> I've<00:03:40.850> used<00:03:41.209> some<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> other<00:03:41.840> tools

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
things I've used some of the other tools

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.319 
things I've used some of the other tools
and<00:03:44.049> they<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.230> seem<00:03:45.910> they<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:47.150> seem<00:03:47.299> a

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
and they just seem they just seem a

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.849 
and they just seem they just seem a
little<00:03:47.540> too<00:03:47.750> aggressive<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.410> they<00:03:48.440> change<00:03:48.709> my

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
little too aggressive and they change my

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.190 
little too aggressive and they change my
form<00:03:48.920> up<00:03:49.310> too<00:03:49.459> much<00:03:49.640> for<00:03:50.630> me<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.019> really

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
form up too much for me to really

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.759 
form up too much for me to really
believe<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.590> they<00:03:51.829> give<00:03:52.040> me<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> carryover

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
believe that they give me the carryover

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.800 
believe that they give me the carryover
that<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.890> slingshot<00:03:55.340> does<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:58.570> again<00:03:59.570> it's

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that the slingshot does and again it's

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.229 
that the slingshot does and again it's
like<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.290> said<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:01.370> not<00:04:01.579> something<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.120> you

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
like I said it's not something that you
