 [Applause] 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.220
 and we have started to like children is 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.469
 hard to believe but children are not 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.349
 as bad as they were before their 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.360
 rudeness they seem pleasant to us like 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.650
 when toby put a frog glory on 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.900
 the back 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.699
 of being horrible for glory but 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.539
 upside down the girls decide that we 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.150
 loved the mischief of top 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.109
 the other day I saw glory break with pepe 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.939
 for the millionth time, what a spectacle 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.460
 this seemed to me to be forever 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.110
 because the pp was enraged and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.880
 He told glory that he would never find 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.010
 someone like him 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.180
 without any genius but it is not what 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 glory waits why 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.150
 he wants pp because he would want to 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.250
 someone like him 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.330
 [Applause] 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.880
 dollars to the most polite child in the city 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.819
 polite and too sweet to win 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.590
