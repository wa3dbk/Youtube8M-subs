the school can be Hesh tubes where it's
kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.100> they're<00:00:59.370> they<00:01:00.239> fit

difference<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.430> noted<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
difference that I have noted is that

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
difference that I have noted is that
after<00:01:13.650> wearing<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.760> after<00:01:15.090> putting

after wearing these and after putting

after wearing these and after putting
them<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.040> put<00:01:17.040> these<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.909> feel<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
them on I put these on and they feel a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.249 
them on I put these on and they feel a
lot<00:01:18.479> lighter<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.619> head<00:01:20.210> however<00:01:21.259> comfort

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
lot lighter on the head however comfort

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
lot lighter on the head however comfort
is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> completely<00:01:23.009> different<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
is a completely different thing because

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.690 
is a completely different thing because
I<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:25.020> wear<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> lot<00:01:26.009> longer<00:01:26.280> time

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
without even noticing them then my

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.080 
without even noticing them then my
school<00:01:29.369> candy<00:01:29.790> Heche<00:01:29.970> tubes

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
school candy Heche tubes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
school candy Heche tubes
however<00:01:33.090> these<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.869> lose<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.650> couple

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
however these do lose out on a couple

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.819 
however these do lose out on a couple
factors<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.600> being<00:01:37.049> their<00:01:37.530> looks

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
factors the first one being their looks

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.600 
factors the first one being their looks
I<00:01:38.630> feel<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> cannot<00:01:40.710> wear<00:01:40.979> these<00:01:41.189> out<00:01:41.430> in

school<00:01:54.840> candy<00:01:55.320> hash<00:01:55.500> twos<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.850> public<00:01:57.030> if

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
school candy hash twos out in public if

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.249 
school candy hash twos out in public if
I<00:01:57.540> need<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.399> as<00:01:59.399> far<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.119> Sam<00:02:00.390> quality<00:02:01.020> goes

I<00:02:01.969> think<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.420> razer<00:02:03.659> kraken<00:02:03.869> z'

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
I think the razer kraken z'

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.350 
I think the razer kraken z'
might<00:02:05.430> edge<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.780> school<00:02:07.079> candy<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.710> twos<00:02:08.009> out

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
might edge the school candy has twos out

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.869 
might edge the school candy has twos out
slightly<00:02:09.560> there's<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.709> slight<00:02:11.190> noticeable

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
slightly there's a slight noticeable

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.040 
slightly there's a slight noticeable
difference

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
difference

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.280 
difference
I<00:02:13.100> think<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.580> base<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.540> base<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> lot

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I think the base of the base is a lot

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.870 
I think the base of the base is a lot
better<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.430> Razer<00:02:17.850> Kraken<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.390 

the<00:02:23.880> pure<00:02:24.150> sounds<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:25.340> slightly<00:02:26.340> better<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the pure sounds is slightly better and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
the pure sounds is slightly better and
but<00:02:29.400> again<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.270> not<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.780> huge

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
but again it's it's not a huge

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.830 
but again it's it's not a huge
noticeable<00:02:31.950> difference<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:33.420> quite<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
noticeable difference I'm not quite the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.220 
noticeable difference I'm not quite the
audiophile

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
audiophile

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.080 
audiophile
the<00:02:37.230> major<00:02:37.620> reason<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the major reason I like these is for the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.970 
the major reason I like these is for the
comfort<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
comfort if they just have a really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.490 
comfort if they just have a really
comfortable<00:02:41.310> feel<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.330> them<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:43.140> gonna<00:02:43.320> let

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
comfortable feel to them I'm gonna let

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.990 
comfortable feel to them I'm gonna let
you<00:02:43.620> see<00:02:43.860> they've<00:02:44.220> got<00:02:44.400> quite<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> little

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you see they've got quite a little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.580 
you see they've got quite a little
cushion<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:48.900> really<00:02:49.440> do

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
cushion and you know they just really do

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.120 
cushion and you know they just really do
they<00:02:49.830> fit<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.610> nicely<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.950> like

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
they fit really nicely I really like

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.420 
they fit really nicely I really like
them<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:54.210> other<00:02:54.450> disadvantage<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.830> with

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
them one other disadvantage is that with

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.300 
them one other disadvantage is that with
the<00:02:56.670> base<00:02:56.880> model<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.540> these<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.770> not<00:02:58.800> get

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the base model like these you do not get

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.530 
the base model like these you do not get
the<00:03:00.410> microphone<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.910> school<00:03:03.180> candy

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the microphone like this school candy

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.780 
the microphone like this school candy
has<00:03:03.690> choose<00:03:04.020> do<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.980> come<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.580> little

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
has choose do they come with the little

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
has choose do they come with the little
microphone<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.960> know<00:03:07.380> if<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.590> knew<00:03:07.710> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
microphone that you know if you knew the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.290 
microphone that you know if you knew the
answer<00:03:07.890> phone<00:03:08.400> call<00:03:08.640> you're<00:03:08.910> listening<00:03:09.210> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
answer phone call you're listening to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.130 
answer phone call you're listening to
music<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.710> my<00:03:10.860> opinion<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:12.090> Razer<00:03:12.690> Kraken

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
music so in my opinion the Razer Kraken

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.380 
music so in my opinion the Razer Kraken
are<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> little<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.850> gaming

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
are a little bit more of a gaming

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.040 
are a little bit more of a gaming
headphone<00:03:16.730> where<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.360> can<00:03:18.630> listen<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
headphone where and you can listen to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.600 
headphone where and you can listen to
music<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.680> them<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.160> they're<00:03:20.340> they're

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
music with them but they're they're

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.310 
music with them but they're they're
better<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:20.880> gaming<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.570> believe<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
better for gaming I believe I think I

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.470 
better for gaming I believe I think I
think<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.740> more<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.820> surround<00:03:27.150> sound

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
think it's a more of a surround sound

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.300 
think it's a more of a surround sound
system<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:29.209> whereas<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.690> Hesh<00:03:30.990> tubes<00:03:31.380> if

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
