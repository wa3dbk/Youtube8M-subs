now<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.560> wouldn't<00:00:19.949> say<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
now I wouldn't say that about some of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
now I wouldn't say that about some of
the<00:00:21.060> later<00:00:21.270> four<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.750> five<00:00:21.990> speeds<00:00:22.380> with

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
synchromesh and all the gears but let me

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.830 
synchromesh and all the gears but let me
show<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.590> gearbox<00:00:26.130> works

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
show you how this little gearbox works

show you how this little gearbox works
now<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> our<00:00:28.380> input<00:00:28.760> shaft<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.269> clutch

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
now this is our input shaft the clutch

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.620 
now this is our input shaft the clutch
disc<00:00:30.869> rides<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:32.059> this<00:00:33.059> goes<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
disc rides right here this goes into the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
disc rides right here this goes into the
front<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> transmission<00:00:34.700> first<00:00:35.700> thing

front of the transmission first thing

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.639 
front of the transmission first thing
you<00:00:35.910> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> check<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.809> big<00:00:37.050> ball

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you want to check is this big ball

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740 
you want to check is this big ball
bearing<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.250> front<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> should<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.540> nice

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
bearing up front here it should be nice

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
bearing up front here it should be nice
and<00:00:39.809> smooth<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.920> any<00:00:41.100> hitches<00:00:41.399> in

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and smooth and not have any hitches in

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.770 
and smooth and not have any hitches in
it<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.480> seems<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.110> pretty<00:00:43.410> good

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
it and are seems to be pretty good

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.470 
it and are seems to be pretty good
behind<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.640> these<00:00:47.640> needle<00:00:48.090> bearings

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
behind that are these needle bearings

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.100 
behind that are these needle bearings
that<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.180> those<00:00:51.180> two<00:00:51.510> need<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that go in here and those two need to be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.810 
that go in here and those two need to be
smooth<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> clean<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.250> shiny<00:00:53.550> they

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
smooth and clean and shiny they

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
smooth and clean and shiny they
shouldn't<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.180> burned<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.780> pitted<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.320> they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
shouldn't be burned or pitted if they

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
shouldn't be burned or pitted if they
are<00:00:55.920> you'll<00:00:56.430> need<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> replace<00:00:56.910> them<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
are you'll need to replace them and you

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
are you'll need to replace them and you
also<00:00:58.289> want<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> check<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> journal

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
also want to check the way the journal

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.260 
also want to check the way the journal
where<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.239> ride<00:01:00.620> now<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.460> where<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
where they ride now back here where this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.340 
where they ride now back here where this
shaft<00:01:03.600> goes<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
shaft goes on you can see that this is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
shaft goes on you can see that this is
worn<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.920> there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> ridge<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.939> from

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
worn and there's a ridge in there from

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
worn and there's a ridge in there from
these<00:01:09.750> bearings<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.950> poor

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
these bearings and that's just poor

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
these bearings and that's just poor
maintenance<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.600> lubricant<00:01:13.080> has<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.380> been

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
maintenance the lubricant has not been

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
maintenance the lubricant has not been
changed<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> transmission<00:01:14.909> often

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
changed in this transmission often

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
changed in this transmission often
enough<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.409> quite<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.920> wear

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
enough so we've got quite a bit of wear

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
enough so we've got quite a bit of wear
on<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.939> may<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> replace<00:01:18.600> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
on there and we may have to replace this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039 
on there and we may have to replace this
if<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> find<00:01:19.590> another<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.360> back<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
if we can find another one back here is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.800 
if we can find another one back here is
your<00:01:22.380> low<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> reverse<00:01:22.979> slider<00:01:23.400> gear<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.750> I'm

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
your low and reverse slider gear now I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.539 
your low and reverse slider gear now I'm
going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.320> assembly<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> show

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
going to take this assembly off and show

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.060 
going to take this assembly off and show
you<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.939> bit<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.100> in<00:01:29.689> here<00:01:30.689> are

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
you a little bit about it in here are

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
you a little bit about it in here are
the<00:01:32.070> synchro<00:01:32.490> rings<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.479> little

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the synchro rings and these little

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
the synchro rings and these little
annular<00:01:34.259> grooves<00:01:34.680> sweep<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> oil<00:01:35.729> off<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
annular grooves sweep the oil off this

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
annular grooves sweep the oil off this
ring<00:01:37.049> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.369> acts<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
ring which is kind of kind of acts as a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.210 
ring which is kind of kind of acts as a
clutch<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.200> meshes<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> gears

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
clutch and that's what meshes the gears

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
clutch and that's what meshes the gears
if<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.150> grooves<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.780> worn<00:01:42.990> down

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
if these little grooves are worn down

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
if these little grooves are worn down
you<00:01:43.860> won't<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> nice<00:01:44.520> smooth<00:01:44.880> shift<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you won't get a nice smooth shift the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
you won't get a nice smooth shift the
gears<00:01:45.810> will<00:01:46.110> clash<00:01:46.470> these<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.549> good

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
gears will clash these are pretty good

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
gears will clash these are pretty good

slider<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.060> had<00:01:54.270> some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
slider here you can see has had some

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.289 
slider here you can see has had some
pretty<00:01:54.990> heavy<00:01:55.560> damage<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> years<00:01:56.759> from

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pretty heavy damage over the years from

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
pretty heavy damage over the years from
just<00:01:57.600> sloppy<00:01:57.899> shifting<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> could<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
just sloppy shifting it could be that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
just sloppy shifting it could be that
the<00:01:59.280> linkage<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.820> out<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.119> adjustment<00:02:00.240> or

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the linkage was out of adjustment or

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.959 
the linkage was out of adjustment or
just<00:02:01.469> aggressive<00:02:01.829> shifting<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.790> pretty

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
just aggressive shifting but it's pretty

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.050 
just aggressive shifting but it's pretty
chipped<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:04.320> need<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> replace<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:06.770> ok

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
chipped up will need to replace that ok

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.990 
chipped up will need to replace that ok
now<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.450> our<00:02:09.599> cluster<00:02:10.379> gear<00:02:10.760> with<00:02:11.760> our

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
now this is our cluster gear with our

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.550 
now this is our cluster gear with our
three<00:02:12.690> different<00:02:12.989> speeds<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
three different speeds on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.940 
three different speeds on
on<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.090> you'll<00:02:15.090> notice<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.590> gear<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
on it and you'll notice this gear is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.699 
on it and you'll notice this gear is
very<00:02:17.370> badly<00:02:17.640> chipped<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
very badly chipped in here this is

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.140 
very badly chipped in here this is
definitely<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.819> replaced

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
definitely going to have to be replaced

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.729 
definitely going to have to be replaced
because<00:02:21.450> these<00:02:21.720> gears<00:02:22.020> will<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.410> continue

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
because these gears will just continue

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.699 
because these gears will just continue
to<00:02:23.040> deteriorate<00:02:23.750> that's<00:02:24.750> too<00:02:24.989> bad<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.590> there

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
to deteriorate that's too bad and there

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.190 
to deteriorate that's too bad and there
again<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.400> sloppy<00:02:26.760> shifting<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.840> not

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
again it's just sloppy shifting not not

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.630 
again it's just sloppy shifting not not
paying<00:02:28.500> attention<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.040> our<00:02:29.280> synchro

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
paying attention because our synchro

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.270 
paying attention because our synchro
rings<00:02:29.819> are<00:02:29.940> actually<00:02:30.209> pretty<00:02:30.390> good<00:02:34.099> now<00:02:35.099> this

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
rings are actually pretty good now this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
rings are actually pretty good now this
is<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.459> side<00:02:35.819> plate<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> these<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is the side plate and these are the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690 
is the side plate and these are the
shifting<00:02:37.319> Forks<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.830> move<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> gears<00:02:38.459> back

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
shifting Forks they move the gears back

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
shifting Forks they move the gears back
and<00:02:38.970> forth<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.750> want<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.989> make<00:02:40.110> sure<00:02:40.140> these

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and forth you want to make sure these

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.830 
and forth you want to make sure these
aren't<00:02:40.800> bent<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.519> worn<00:02:42.030> these<00:02:42.569> look<00:02:42.810> pretty

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
aren't bent or worn these look pretty

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.710 
aren't bent or worn these look pretty
good<00:02:43.310> also<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.819> want<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.060> make<00:02:45.120> sure<00:02:45.269> these

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
good also you want to make sure these

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
good also you want to make sure these
little<00:02:46.080> dick<00:02:46.290> Tonks<00:02:46.530> down<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.519> are<00:02:47.670> in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
little dick Tonks down in here are in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
little dick Tonks down in here are in
good<00:02:48.330> shape<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.380> transmission<00:02:50.040> will

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
good shape so the transmission will

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.240 
good shape so the transmission will
shift<00:02:50.459> crisply<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.510> these<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.440> quite<00:02:53.040> nice

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
shift crisply and these are quite nice

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.610 
shift crisply and these are quite nice
it's<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.970> distance<00:02:54.330> fine<00:02:54.630> won't<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.500> any

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it's the distance fine won't have any

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.360 
it's the distance fine won't have any
problems<00:02:56.100> there<00:02:56.569> well<00:02:57.569> that's<00:02:57.750> about<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.370> now

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
problems there well that's about it now
