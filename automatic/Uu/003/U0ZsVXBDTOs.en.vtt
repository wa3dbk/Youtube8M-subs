00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 but what the hell do friends gather 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:13.200
 update 090 many have problems 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.789
 with graphical and exactly that is for many 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.960
 started fps firing this number of frames 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.420
 my Gestapo also fell alive, even with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 this problem which all a little polazil 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.239
 graphically I was able to adjust the game 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 more belts and optimize the game under 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.730
 computer power grace computer me 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.510
 Not really 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.630
 You can say so the video card is not 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.739
 dug up 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.739
 me on the trail 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:56.110
 and radeon 7850 bought a little saw it 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.080
 one gigabyte memory card 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 Well, let's proceed to the best 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.980
 so there are games 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.980
 midas 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.439
 watch 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 what you need to do go graphic 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.760
 construction game permission is the same for rendering 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.870
 what 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.790
 it determines the quality of the scenes but look 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.010
 when our table you see there are rosaries everything is clear 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.900
 seen perfectly 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:35.020
 choose 3d render what we get 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.810
 you blurred fuzzy picture that is, I 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.080
 would say it is a development 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.530
 poorly put it on the maximum he 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 no way in the camera does not affect 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.200
 frames per second 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.180
 color filter and turn off and 1 me 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.710
 I think that he is simply not needed in the game 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.170
 switched on and off at your 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.290
 lines, as you can see, I turned it on 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
 affects fps 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.380
 how much again i'm possible 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 someone on the face angle of view 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.610
 human 95 degrees therefore every 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 I put in here I present the top 5 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.070
 it holds mineral degrees a 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 the aspect ratio of the expose 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.499
 Full screen less often 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.870
 screen resolution maximum available 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:36.769
 go into expanding us difficult 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:42.569
 texture quality set to max 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.609
 this is how you can read the detail 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.010
 surfaces of game objects especially 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.900
 we heat a song for consideration notices 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.590
 parameter value may increase 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.510
 can increase this 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.939
 construction game lighting quality 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.609
 turn off shadow quality 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.909
 she is something to prevent right in sniper 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.850
 mode, too, the keys it will include 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.600
 our trio on 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.550
 Mihal so that's all blew up 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.320
 but no they didnâ€™t blast 1 switch to 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.700
 allies like this and let's be on it 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.790
 see the quality of additional 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.129
 effects this quality blasters 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.000
 shots when you drive let 's say 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:33.329
 to water yes what will follow you 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.700
 know any goal we put it on 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.890
 low since at between low highs 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.120
 don't feel any different 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.430
 additional effects in sniper 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.269
 mode this too 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.540
 same shot I advise you to put them 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.170
 on low since put home 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.019
 put on mars you will have a huge 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.879
 there was a huge huge clubs 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:05.730
 smoke that will not only increase fps but 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:10.709
 and will contribute 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:14.519
 poor visibility of the enemy that is here 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.009
 puffs of smoke yes and you can't live it 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.470
 and those who took you can accurately 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:23.699
 target modules that shoot 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.669
 the amount of vegetation to determine 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:34.440
 yourself but it lowers fps here see 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:36.630
 see boots cross now very 4 but 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.009
 the amount of vegetation has become more I 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.419
 I think that you need to choose post-processing 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.120
 this determines the quality of fogs and other 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.220
 turn is simply just not possible 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.210
 caterpillar effect greatly reduces 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.550
 fps and so that such bribery 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.770
 out of the tracks 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.659
 let's say when you drive on sandy 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:08.510
 the surfaces are out of your wheels 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:12.990
 dirt will fly away and so on 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.590
 I think very detailed 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.320
 trees I prefer to turn off because 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.440
 what's up cat not giving 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:29.380
 and the distance of drawing between the middle and 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:32.860
 the maximum will not be much difference 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.550
 but you can not put on low quality 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.980
 motion blur turn off come 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:46.890
 above all, the quality of the landscape is mandatory 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:50.560
 set to maximum as contours 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.550
 Thief objects will become lower if 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.620
 you turn them off and just if you stand 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.620
 near the minimum edge 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.370
 surfaces will just fall into 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.220
 this object 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:10.639
 as the server has a height 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:15.100
 this object when frying settings 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:19.990
 for matches the water quality between medium and 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.030
 maximum you will not see the difference because 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.340
 particular difference 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.340
 because on average settings what 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.860
 beautiful water regret it in my opinion 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:36.020
 I do not like to show you why 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:42.289
 exhibit on average quality ran 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:45.770
 this is fallen leaves and other garbage can 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.289
 get a detail of objects with a picture 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.070
 average dynamic quality change 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:54.229
 effects tick marks tracks tick 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.900
 that 's basically all you need to know to 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:04.060
 optimize your computer for new 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.060
 update everyone thank you was arbazh 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.750
 dodge
