there's<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> fan<00:00:32.189> assembly<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> see

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
there's the fan assembly you can see

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.040 
there's the fan assembly you can see
right<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.239> clutch<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.660> actually

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
right there and the clutch is actually

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
right there and the clutch is actually
inboard<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.040> fan<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.059> push<00:00:39.329> rod<00:00:39.600> for

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
inboard of that fan the the push rod for

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.740 
inboard of that fan the the push rod for
the<00:00:40.250> release<00:00:41.250> bearing<00:00:41.460> goes<00:00:42.450> through<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the release bearing goes through the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
the release bearing goes through the
center<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> fan<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> actually<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
center of the fan and actually it's the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450 
center of the fan and actually it's the
clutch<00:00:45.230> basically<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.920> acts<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
clutch basically this way it acts as a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
clutch basically this way it acts as a
sandwich<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.750> trying<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> figure<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.200> how

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
sandwich so I'm trying to figure out how

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
sandwich so I'm trying to figure out how
to<00:00:49.379> pull<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> fan<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.059> don't<00:00:51.600> know

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to pull that fan off so I don't know

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.560 
to pull that fan off so I don't know
that<00:00:51.719> anybody's<00:00:52.170> ever<00:00:52.199> seen<00:00:52.530> inside<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.730> S<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that anybody's ever seen inside an S you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
that anybody's ever seen inside an S you
get<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.840> light<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.730> gotta<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
get my light in here you gotta take the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
get my light in here you gotta take the
wheel<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.989> take<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> axle<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
wheel off you can take the axle out you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
wheel off you can take the axle out you
got<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> drop<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> engine<00:00:59.520> down<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
got to drop the engine down but you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.130 
got to drop the engine down but you
don't<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> pull<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> engine<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
don't have to pull the engine out of the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.290 
don't have to pull the engine out of the
car<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.559> nice

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
car which is nice

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
car which is nice
then<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> clutch<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.809> similar<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> scooter

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
then the clutch is similar to a scooter

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
then the clutch is similar to a scooter
although<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.850> dry<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> see

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
although it's dry and the you can see

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
although it's dry and the you can see
the<00:01:09.659> fulcrum<00:01:09.960> arms<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> three

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the fulcrum arms there are the three

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
the fulcrum arms there are the three
fulcrum<00:01:11.189> arms<00:01:11.450> press<00:01:12.450> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 

I<00:01:16.320> guess<00:01:16.560> did<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.369> inside<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.939> presses

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I guess did the inside there presses

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.590 
I guess did the inside there presses
outward<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:20.400> clutch<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.210> bad<00:01:21.360> on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
outward this clutch is really bad on

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
outward this clutch is really bad on
this<00:01:21.720> car<00:01:21.960> barely<00:01:22.890> goes<00:01:23.040> into<00:01:23.280> gear<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:24.150> all

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this car barely goes into gear with all

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
this car barely goes into gear with all
the<00:01:24.509> newfound<00:01:24.900> performance<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> found<00:01:26.090> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the newfound performance that I found it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.710 
the newfound performance that I found it
made<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> even<00:01:27.450> worse

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
made it even worse

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.899 
made it even worse
so<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.200> doing<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> clutch<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.700> say

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so we're doing a clutch and I can't say

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
so we're doing a clutch and I can't say
that<00:01:30.119> I've<00:01:30.180> ever<00:01:30.240> done<00:01:30.509> an<00:01:30.600> NSU<00:01:31.020> clutch<00:01:31.259> before

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that I've ever done an NSU clutch before

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.340 
that I've ever done an NSU clutch before
it's<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.310> new<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.850> me

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's all new one on me

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's all new one on me
however<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> great<00:01:36.000> book<00:01:36.320> here<00:01:37.320> on

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
however I've got a great book here on

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.069 
however I've got a great book here on
the<00:01:38.009> Subaru<00:01:38.280> 360<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.329> working<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.720> as

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the Subaru 360 that I'm working on as

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
the Subaru 360 that I'm working on as
well<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.360> take<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.509> doing<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
well and take I'm doing it right so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.749 
well and take I'm doing it right so
hopefully<00:01:45.210> soon<00:01:45.420> we'll<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.750> driving<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
hopefully soon we'll be driving this

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.030 
hopefully soon we'll be driving this
rejuvenated<00:01:47.780> NSU<00:01:48.780> around<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> block<00:01:49.770> maybe

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
rejuvenated NSU around the block maybe

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.190 
rejuvenated NSU around the block maybe
burn<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:50.579> rubber

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
burn some rubber

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.249 
burn some rubber
probably<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.799> it'll<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> new<00:01:54.540> clutch

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
probably not but it'll have a new clutch

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.420 
probably not but it'll have a new clutch
that<00:01:55.500> works<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:55.920> good<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> go

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
that works pretty good so there you go

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.100

got<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.959> pull<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> whole<00:02:21.319> engine<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.709> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
got to pull the whole engine out of the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.759 
got to pull the whole engine out of the
car<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.430> clutch<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.959> right<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.620> this

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
car the clutch is right here in this

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.150 
car the clutch is right here in this
housing<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:26.379> I<00:02:27.379> pulled<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> clutch<00:02:27.920> out

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
housing here and I pulled the clutch out

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.630 
housing here and I pulled the clutch out
and<00:02:28.400> quite<00:02:29.000> possibly<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.280> worst

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and quite possibly it is the worst

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.100 
and quite possibly it is the worst
clutch<00:02:31.970> I've<00:02:32.209> ever<00:02:32.510> seen

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
clutch I've ever seen

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.009 
clutch I've ever seen
so<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:34.340> clutch<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.819> pack<00:02:35.299> basically

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
so this clutch is a pack basically

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.110 
so this clutch is a pack basically
there's<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.349> springs<00:02:36.799> for<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.250> diaphragm

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
there's the springs for the diaphragm

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.539 
there's the springs for the diaphragm
pressure<00:02:38.569> plate<00:02:39.049> if<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.010> let<00:02:40.220> go<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:40.400> my

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
pressure plate if I let go with my

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.949 
pressure plate if I let go with my
handle<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.090> springs<00:02:41.360> will<00:02:41.450> pop<00:02:41.599> out<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:41.900> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
handle the springs will pop out so I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.869 
handle the springs will pop out so I
can't<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.379> but<00:02:43.040> take<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> look<00:02:43.549> at<00:02:43.760> this
