hi guys after a great response from the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.309 
hi guys after a great response from the
last<00:00:04.560> tutorial<00:00:04.799> I've<00:00:05.390> been<00:00:06.390> put<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
last tutorial I've been put with the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
last tutorial I've been put with the
challenge<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.980> do<00:00:08.490> some<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.120> edits

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
challenge to do some of the edits

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.499 
challenge to do some of the edits
through<00:00:09.840> lot<00:00:10.050> room<00:00:10.320> instead<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> Photoshop<00:00:11.509> we

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
through lot room instead of Photoshop we

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.900 
through lot room instead of Photoshop we
have<00:00:12.660> an<00:00:12.840> image<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.440> Michel<00:00:14.009> Celia's<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
have an image from Michel Celia's and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.230 
have an image from Michel Celia's and
Devon<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.260> beautiful<00:00:16.740> image<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.279> female

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
Devon it's a beautiful image of female

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
Devon it's a beautiful image of female
and<00:00:18.510> male<00:00:18.810> bed<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> same<00:00:20.100> species<00:00:20.460> which

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
and male bed of the same species which

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.929 
and male bed of the same species which
is<00:00:21.060> quite<00:00:21.449> rare<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.900> capture<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.619> frame<00:00:23.010> if

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is quite rare to capture in one frame if

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.310 
is quite rare to capture in one frame if
we<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.269> through<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.570> details<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
we look through the details of the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.540 
we look through the details of the
camera<00:00:25.939> mic<00:00:26.939> routing<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> Nikon<00:00:28.550> d5000

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
camera mic routing on a Nikon d5000

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
camera mic routing on a Nikon d5000
which<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> crop<00:00:30.840> sensor<00:00:31.260> camera

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
which is a crop sensor camera

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
which is a crop sensor camera
so<00:00:32.340> obviously<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> advantage<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> using<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so obviously the advantage of using a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
so obviously the advantage of using a
crop<00:00:34.079> sensor<00:00:34.260> camera<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.760> get

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
crop sensor camera is that you can get

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
crop sensor camera is that you can get
closer<00:00:36.149> into<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.750> subject<00:00:37.200> without<00:00:37.829> having

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
closer into your subject without having

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.170 
closer into your subject without having
such<00:00:39.090> big<00:00:39.360> loss<00:00:39.629> although<00:00:40.140> 550<00:00:41.100> moles<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.730> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
such big loss although 550 moles is it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.920 
such big loss although 550 moles is it's
quite<00:00:42.329> impressive

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
quite impressive

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.279 
quite impressive
we<00:00:43.680> preparing<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.340> image<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.629> three

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
we preparing this image for a three

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.860 
we preparing this image for a three
print<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.730> few<00:00:48.239> things<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.600> need<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
print so a few things we need to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.470 
print so a few things we need to
consider<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> sharpness<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.700> resolution

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
consider is the sharpness and resolution

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.400 
consider is the sharpness and resolution
and<00:00:52.489> we<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> take<00:00:54.180> notes<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.719> where<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and we need to take notes of where the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.069 
and we need to take notes of where the
focus<00:00:55.829> pointers<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.660> discussed<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> last

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
focus pointers as discussed in the last

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
focus pointers as discussed in the last
tutorial<00:00:59.090> whether<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> person<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.930> an

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
tutorial whether it's a person or an

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.570 
tutorial whether it's a person or an
animal<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.680> eyes<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.250> points<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> focus<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
animal that eyes the points of focus and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.050 
animal that eyes the points of focus and
if<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.790> look<00:01:05.939> through<00:01:05.970> marks<00:01:06.689> image<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:08.060> we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
if we look through marks image here we

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
if we look through marks image here we
need<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.049> aware<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
need to just be aware of it because

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
need to just be aware of it because
unfortunately<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.330> focus<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> eye<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
unfortunately the focus on the eye is a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
unfortunately the focus on the eye is a
little<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.890> soft<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
little bit soft as you can see here the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170 
little bit soft as you can see here the
focus<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.439> towards<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> branch<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
focus is more towards the branch of the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.289 
focus is more towards the branch of the
image<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:20.250> understandable<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> way

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
image but it's understandable the way

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.920 
image but it's understandable the way
the<00:01:21.479> birds<00:01:21.659> move<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> way<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the birds move and the way in which you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.560 
the birds move and the way in which you
have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> move<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.619> capture<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> image<00:01:26.340> I

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
have to move to capture the image I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
have to move to capture the image I
think<00:01:27.570> he's<00:01:27.689> done<00:01:27.840> quite<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.290> job<00:01:28.670> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
think he's done quite a good job with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
think he's done quite a good job with
the<00:01:29.820> composition<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> image<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.680> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the composition of the image you can see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219 
the composition of the image you can see
the<00:01:32.100> birds<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> center<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the birds are in the center which is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
the birds are in the center which is
likely<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> focus<00:01:35.909> point<00:01:36.150> being

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
likely because of the focus point being

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
likely because of the focus point being
set<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> center<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> his<00:01:37.439> camera<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.670> I'd

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
set in the center of his camera what I'd

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
set in the center of his camera what I'd
encourage<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.600> shooting<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> field<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
encourage when shooting on the field is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
encourage when shooting on the field is
that<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.340> move<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.000> focus<00:01:42.390> points<00:01:42.720> are

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that you move your focus points are

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
that you move your focus points are
either<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.259> left<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:43.829> rather<00:01:44.700> gain

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
either the left or the right rather gain

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
either the left or the right rather gain
the<00:01:45.810> maximum<00:01:46.500> resolution<00:01:46.680> from<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.430> camera

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the maximum resolution from your camera

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
the maximum resolution from your camera
instead<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> trying<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> process<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.110> in

of<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> image<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.770> I'll<00:05:21.919> mask<00:05:22.160> out<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.430> birds

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
of the image and I'll mask out the birds

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.390 
of the image and I'll mask out the birds
by<00:05:23.060> holding<00:05:23.419> down<00:05:23.540> alt<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.140> painting<00:05:25.100> a<00:05:25.160> mask

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
by holding down alt and painting a mask

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.370 
by holding down alt and painting a mask
over<00:05:25.700> where<00:05:26.030> I<00:05:26.240> don't<00:05:26.479> want<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.020> brush<00:05:27.229> to

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
over where I don't want the brush to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.010 
over where I don't want the brush to
have<00:05:27.530> an<00:05:27.650> effect<00:05:28.390> been<00:05:29.390> looking<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:29.840> finish

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
have an effect been looking to finish

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.200 
have an effect been looking to finish
off<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.440> image<00:05:30.710> I'll<00:05:31.010> grab<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.370> graduated

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
off the image I'll grab a graduated

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.540 
off the image I'll grab a graduated
filter<00:05:32.240> drag<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.350> up<00:05:33.530> from<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.220> bottom<00:05:34.370> to

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
filter drag it up from the bottom to

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.300 
filter drag it up from the bottom to
reduce<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.210> highlight<00:05:35.540> from<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.900> base<00:05:36.310> then

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
reduce the highlight from the base then

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.219 
reduce the highlight from the base then
with<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.640> radial<00:05:38.000> filter<00:05:38.180> we<00:05:38.540> can<00:05:38.570> create<00:05:38.990> our

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
with the radial filter we can create our

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.110 
with the radial filter we can create our
customized<00:05:39.740> minutes<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.370> reduce<00:05:40.970> the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
customized minutes and reduce the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.670 
customized minutes and reduce the
sharpness<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.750> surrounding<00:05:42.229> background

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
sharpness of surrounding background

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.820 
sharpness of surrounding background
