everybody's<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
everybody's kind of going in that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.210 
everybody's kind of going in that
direction<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.500> days<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:39.270> know

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
direction these days because you know

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.840 
direction these days because you know
like<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.400> portrait<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> us<00:01:42.180> straight<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.170> skull

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
like a portrait of us straight up skull

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.539 
like a portrait of us straight up skull
so<00:01:44.850> many<00:01:45.060> times<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.750> mean<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> lot<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> people

um I think it has its pros and cons you
know<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.320> definitely<00:02:23.470> good<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.220> mean<00:02:24.370> if

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
know it's definitely good if I mean if

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.090 
know it's definitely good if I mean if
somebody<00:02:24.930> has<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.350> takes<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.680> put<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
somebody has what it takes to put the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.200 
somebody has what it takes to put the
effort<00:02:27.280> out<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.910> actually<00:02:28.090> learn<00:02:29.010> properly

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
effort out to actually learn properly

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.870 
effort out to actually learn properly
then<00:02:31.210> if<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> video<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.350> tool<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:33.070> I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
then if the video can be a tool then I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.270 
then if the video can be a tool then I
mean<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:34.990> it's<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.530> tool<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.770> they<00:02:36.220> can

nobody<00:05:32.570> gave<00:05:32.870> me<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:33.050> chance<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:35.260> I<00:05:36.260> just<00:05:36.680> the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
nobody gave me a chance I I just the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.270 
nobody gave me a chance I I just the
thing<00:05:37.610> about<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:38.000> whole<00:05:38.180> TV<00:05:38.950> deal<00:05:39.950> and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
thing about the whole TV deal and

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.460 
thing about the whole TV deal and
everything<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.669> think<00:05:40.910> maybe<00:05:41.510> tattooing<00:05:42.260> just

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
everything I think maybe tattooing just

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.800 
everything I think maybe tattooing just
become<00:05:42.890> more<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:43.340> like<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.550> fashion<00:05:44.210> show<00:05:44.240> or

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
become more of like a fashion show or

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.500 
become more of like a fashion show or
you<00:05:45.710> know<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:45.890> popularity<00:05:46.610> contest<00:05:46.850> or

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
you know a popularity contest or

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.950 
you know a popularity contest or
something<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:48.260> uh<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:49.610> think<00:05:49.880> maybe<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.780> art

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
something and uh I think maybe the art

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.190 
something and uh I think maybe the art
should<00:05:51.200> just<00:05:51.380> speak<00:05:51.590> for<00:05:51.800> itself<00:05:51.950> and<00:05:52.370> uh<00:05:53.200> you

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
should just speak for itself and uh you

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.500 
should just speak for itself and uh you
know<00:05:54.320> not<00:05:54.500> not<00:05:55.100> so<00:05:55.280> much<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:56.060> know<00:05:56.180> what<00:05:56.360> you

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
know not not so much you know what you

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.540 
know not not so much you know what you
look<00:05:56.660> like<00:05:56.720> as<00:05:57.169> what<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.530> produce<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:58.520> know

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
