00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.019
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.519
 next little minecraft sees video 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.500
 although I would like you today one they 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.290
 show where he changes the fina near the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 Brawn teams are a marshy swamp ear 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.789
 who would have thought that in socks and it 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.560
 are small buildings in which also off and 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.779
 can spawn to witches 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 witches are indeed since the new version 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.740
 1.4 point 2 as well as this sum 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.670
 had 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.390
 and I just call the world now 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.230
 witch the creative mode pulls the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.610
 of course I write in the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.300
 description then the would just 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.160
 copy and paste just like me 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.530
 yes and I would say I show you 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.899
 now even this great world namely as 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.239
 Portier in a snow bio most of the time 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.770
 relatively close to this and therefore half 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.180
 underground lake that it is now three 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.260
 I happen to be more specific 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.579
 I've got it clamped 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.010
 tested if it really is like that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.460
 because here are mostly cows and then 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.449
 comes a normal hill and next to it is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.189
 actually always influential yes ok great 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.100
 So I'm doing it to me now 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.609
 wider eyeshot a bit 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.679
 so you can see here you are curious 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.170
 at the cows near the lake and then comes 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:21.950
 here a wetland now goes 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.729
 her best on the 8 / tp of the new 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.729
 forces 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:36.429
 he gives you one - 301 64 310 and if 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.380
 her then suppressed then you come 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:42.770
 so almost diagonally opposite so 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.289
 diagonally from your spontaneously dissident and 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.549
 you will have something great to face 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.590
 and indeed it is indeed 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.099
 a young people we believe here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.649
 yes, this is exactly how a minecraft looks like 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.810
 young people from I go now easy 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.759
 take a look 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.009
 so change and spur because I think 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.739
 the witches, there is one here 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.749
 Great year flowerpot with a mushroom 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.220
 trainer an empty kettle and 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.720
 a workbench 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.480
 that's like such a small one 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.970
 initially set up and you can see 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.390
 also that it is relatively new to the building 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.880
 here the stairs are already so weird 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:27.380
 so I've been redone 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.640
 so far since 1.4.2011 point 4.2 like me 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.330
 Witch is in there now 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.010
 unfortunately I do not know that but I have 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.560
 on the internet read that here anyway 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.640
 witches and should be able to expand in 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.090
 one of the next version 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.620
 probably it really has me 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.370
 little bit of a witch this little one 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 lodge 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.930
 I think it's nice and you can 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.790
 hope to try this world myself 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.890
 I liked it so much and the video 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.220
 of course until next time and 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.220
 ciao
