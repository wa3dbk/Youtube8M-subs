00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
yeah that's one of the big things you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.709 
yeah that's one of the big things you
know<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.410> infinity<00:00:47.340> order

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
know when you see infinity order

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.490

Activision actually tweet out a picture

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
Activision actually tweet out a picture
of<00:00:49.860> advanced<00:00:50.190> warfare<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> hype<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
of advanced warfare to get the hype up a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
of advanced warfare to get the hype up a
little<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:51.899> always<00:00:52.020> being<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.620> an

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
little bit they're always being like an

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
little bit they're always being like an
exoskeleton<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.210> reason<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
exoskeleton in it for some reason so so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
exoskeleton in it for some reason so so
I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.860> part<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> your

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I think that's just part of your

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
I think that's just part of your
character<00:00:56.550> yeah<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> cool<00:00:57.690> idea

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
character yeah I think it's a cool idea

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.510 
character yeah I think it's a cool idea
and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> campaign<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.370> can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and I know in the campaign you can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
and I know in the campaign you can
actually<00:00:59.670> kind<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> level<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
actually kind of level up or have

actually kind of level up or have
additions<00:01:02.550> campaign<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.660> upgrade<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
additions campaign you can upgrade a
campaign<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.220> cool<00:01:05.400> yeah<00:01:05.640> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
just an exoskeleton nothing something

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.670 
just an exoskeleton nothing something
that<00:01:33.210> everybody<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.659> achieve<00:01:33.930> easily<00:01:34.350> it'll

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that everybody can achieve easily it'll

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
that everybody can achieve easily it'll
be<00:01:34.799> yeah<00:01:35.250> sure<00:01:35.460> high<00:01:35.640> percent<00:01:36.090> yeah<00:01:36.450> okay<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200

that sounds cool that's kind of sounds
like<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> titanfall<00:01:44.340> situation<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
like a titanfall situation there is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
like a titanfall situation there is
there<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.689> also<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.110> titanfall<00:01:46.549> feature<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
there is also a titanfall feature that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
there is also a titanfall feature that
kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> super

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
kind of what I look like it's a super

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.530 
kind of what I look like it's a super
jump<00:01:49.649> mmm<00:01:50.280> okay<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> their

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
around a corner or you want a dodge an

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
around a corner or you want a dodge an
enemy's<00:01:57.299> fire<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.380> super<00:01:58.680> jump<00:01:58.890> because

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
enemy's fire you can super jump because

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.649 
enemy's fire you can super jump because
you<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> exoskeleton<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.299> makes<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you have this exoskeleton that makes you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
you have this exoskeleton that makes you
super<00:02:00.960> strong<00:02:01.020> yeah<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.890> thing<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.310> was

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
super strong yeah one thing that I was

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
super strong yeah one thing that I was
reading<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> interesting<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
reading which was kind of interesting is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.069 
reading which was kind of interesting is
the<00:02:04.700> balance<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.000> exoskeleton<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.930> real

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the balance of an exoskeleton in real

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
the balance of an exoskeleton in real
life<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.489> had<00:02:08.670> something

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
life because what if you had something

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300 
life because what if you had something
that<00:02:09.090> could<00:02:09.239> move<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.410> strong<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that could move you so strong that it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.650 
that could move you so strong that it
would

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
would

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.080 
would
your<00:02:11.870> bones<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.520> be<00:02:13.610> hardcore<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
your bones I that would be hardcore I

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.640 
your bones I that would be hardcore I
mean<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.570> sure<00:02:14.600> there's<00:02:14.900> padding<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.410> stuff

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
mean I'm sure there's padding and stuff

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.190 
mean I'm sure there's padding and stuff
like<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.630> don't<00:02:17.630> think<00:02:17.810> they'd<00:02:17.960> let

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
like that but I don't think they'd let

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.650 
like that but I don't think they'd let
like<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:19.160> control<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.120> people<00:02:20.420> who<00:02:20.510> are

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
like in control of the people who are

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.480 
like in control of the people who are
actually<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:22.010> we're<00:02:22.160> doing<00:02:22.190> whatever

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
actually like what we're doing whatever

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.430 
actually like what we're doing whatever
War<00:02:22.910> advanced<00:02:23.480> warfare<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:24.320> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
War advanced warfare is in because it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.020 
War advanced warfare is in because it's
in<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> future<00:02:24.980> obviously<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> predict<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
in the future obviously I predict the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.820 
in the future obviously I predict the
future<00:02:26.150> I'm<00:02:26.810> sure<00:02:27.080> they<00:02:27.230> wouldn't<00:02:27.380> just<00:02:27.650> send

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
future I'm sure they wouldn't just send

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.960 
future I'm sure they wouldn't just send
out<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> bunch<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.250> people<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.580> millions<00:02:28.880> of

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
out a bunch of people with millions of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.580 
out a bunch of people with millions of
dollars<00:02:29.240> in<00:02:29.330> exoskeletons<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.320> then<00:02:30.410> just

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
dollars in exoskeletons and then just

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.110 
dollars in exoskeletons and then just
have<00:02:30.740> them<00:02:30.920> all<00:02:31.040> die<00:02:31.310> because<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.060> you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120

we<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.040> in<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.220> way<00:04:21.370> like<00:04:21.519> oh<00:04:21.639> its

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
we think of it in this way like oh its

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.950 
we think of it in this way like oh its
hammering<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.180> gonna<00:04:22.270> ruin<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.600> game<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
hammering it's gonna ruin the game and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.659 
hammering it's gonna ruin the game and
then<00:04:23.110> we<00:04:23.530> get<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.889> game<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.190> figure<00:04:24.400> out<00:04:24.430> Oh

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
then we get the game and figure out Oh

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.430 
then we get the game and figure out Oh

Soldier flying right over the RC XD we
thought<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.229> was<00:04:32.830> terrible<00:04:33.220> all<00:04:33.580> this<00:04:33.790> all

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
thought that was terrible all this all

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.070 
this all this all this mo I've no one
one<00:04:36.820> night<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.210> was<00:04:37.330> cool<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.900> lot<00:04:38.050> of

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
one night that was cool and a lot of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.810 
one night that was cool and a lot of
their<00:04:38.290> stuff<00:04:38.380> they<00:04:38.740> were<00:04:39.010> saying<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.430> based<00:04:39.669> in

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
their stuff they were saying is based in

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.909 
their stuff they were saying is based in
reality<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.570> stops<00:04:41.020> kind<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.830> in

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
reality that stops kind of in

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.379 
reality that stops kind of in
development<00:04:42.430> now<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:42.790> will<00:04:42.940> likely<00:04:43.060> be

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
development now but will likely be

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.210 
development now but will likely be
available<00:04:43.840> when<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.110> in<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.740> setting<00:04:45.100> in

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
available when this in the setting in

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.090 
available when this in the setting in
the<00:04:45.250> future<00:04:45.669> where<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.000> game<00:04:46.240> comes<00:04:46.419> out<00:04:46.630> is

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
the future where this game comes out is

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.159 
the future where this game comes out is
variable<00:04:48.100> grenades<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.810> throw<00:04:50.139> a

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
variable grenades so if you throw a

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.500 
variable grenades so if you throw a
grenade<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:50.979> don't<00:04:51.340> cook<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.729> it's<00:04:52.120> a

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
grenade and don't cook it it's a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.430 
grenade and don't cook it it's a
concussion<00:04:53.110> okay<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.250> if<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:55.090> do<00:04:55.690> cook<00:04:56.260> it

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
concussion okay and if you do cook it

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.100 
concussion okay and if you do cook it
then<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.919> can<00:04:57.070> be<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.460> kind<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.389> like<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.540> portable

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
then it can be a kind of like a portable

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.530 
then it can be a kind of like a portable
radar<00:04:59.380> ok<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:00.729> it<00:05:00.790> would<00:05:00.880> reveal<00:05:01.120> enemy's

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
radar ok so it would reveal enemy's

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.420 
radar ok so it would reveal enemy's
positions<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.169> shutting<00:05:02.470> down<00:05:02.590> cool<00:05:02.830> oh<00:05:03.160> yeah

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
positions for shutting down cool oh yeah

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.460 
positions for shutting down cool oh yeah
that's<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:04.150> great<00:05:04.300> idea<00:05:04.510> was<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:05.020> really<00:05:05.320> good

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
that's a great idea was a really good

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.900 
that's a great idea was a really good
