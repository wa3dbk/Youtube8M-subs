00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
mean it's probably just you know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.160 
mean it's probably just you know
probably<00:01:43.160> not<00:01:43.280> gonna<00:01:43.460> be<00:01:43.580> very<00:01:43.610> long<00:01:46.960> if<00:01:47.960> it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
probably not gonna be very long if it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.350 
probably not gonna be very long if it
was<00:01:48.290> actually<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:49.040> blows<00:01:49.490> between<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.180> two

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
was actually like blows between the two

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.150 
was actually like blows between the two
of<00:01:50.510> them<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.900> no<00:01:51.050> one<00:01:51.080> else<00:01:51.290> involved<00:01:51.710> then<00:01:52.130> I

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
of them and no one else involved then I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.859 
of them and no one else involved then I
think<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.670> Joker<00:01:53.060> would<00:01:53.210> totally<00:01:53.690> man

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
think the Joker would totally man

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.410 
think the Joker would totally man
because<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.530> know<00:01:54.650> he<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.369> know<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:55.790> you

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
because you know he you know just you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.609 
because you know he you know just you
know<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.630> penguin<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.110> not<00:01:57.290> very<00:01:59.380> he's<00:02:00.380> not

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619
