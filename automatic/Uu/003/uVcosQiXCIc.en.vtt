say they flip up say four five six seven

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.560 
say they flip up say four five six seven
eight<00:01:49.550> one<00:01:50.300> two<00:01:50.330> three<00:01:50.990> four<00:01:51.350> five<00:01:51.680> six<00:01:52.040> seven

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
eight one two three four five six seven

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.080 
eight one two three four five six seven
cards<00:01:53.570> okay<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:55.220> they've<00:01:55.370> decided<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.820> about

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
cards okay so they've decided to about

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.660 
cards okay so they've decided to about
seven<00:01:56.390> cards<00:01:56.659> within<00:01:56.780> their<00:01:56.990> packet<00:01:57.670> they

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
seven cards within their packet they

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.420 
seven cards within their packet they
then<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.360> course<00:01:59.600> have<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.900> flip<00:02:00.470> up<00:02:00.650> seven

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
then of course have to flip up seven

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.890 
then of course have to flip up seven
whatever<00:02:01.970> cards<00:02:02.900> within<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.680> other<00:02:04.100> packet

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
whatever cards within the other packet

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.090 
whatever cards within the other packet
so<00:02:05.900> let's<00:02:06.140> say<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:06.320> think<00:02:06.409> that's<00:02:06.620> seven<00:02:06.950> there

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so let's say I think that's seven there

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.609 
so let's say I think that's seven there
one<00:02:07.670> two<00:02:07.909> three<00:02:07.940> four<00:02:08.239> five<00:02:08.689> six<00:02:08.959> seven<00:02:09.259> okay

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
one two three four five six seven okay

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.099 
one two three four five six seven okay
so<00:02:10.219> it's<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.579> free<00:02:10.819> choice<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.510> them<00:02:11.959> of

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109 
so it's just a free choice of them of

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.569 
so it's just a free choice of them of
the<00:02:12.349> amount<00:02:12.499> of<00:02:12.650> cards<00:02:12.889> they<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.099> flip<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.459> in

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
the amount of cards they can flip up in

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.200 
the amount of cards they can flip up in
each<00:02:13.670> packet

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
each packet

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.020 
each packet
as<00:02:14.240> long<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.050> same<00:02:15.170> amount<00:02:15.820> okay<00:02:16.820> now

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
as long as it's the same amount okay now

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810 
as long as it's the same amount okay now
once<00:02:17.180> they've<00:02:17.330> done<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:19.130> gather<00:02:19.400> up<00:02:19.640> all

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
once they've done that we gather up all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.520 
once they've done that we gather up all
the<00:02:19.940> cards<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.630> they<00:02:20.840> simply<00:02:21.200> cut<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the cards and they simply cut the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.860 
the cards and they simply cut the
remaining<00:02:21.770> packet<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.940> table<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.540> we

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
remaining packet on the table and we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.650 
remaining packet on the table and we
just<00:02:24.050> merge<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.680> cards<00:02:24.980> together<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.660> our

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
just merge all the cards together in our

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.750 
just merge all the cards together in our
single<00:02:27.140> deck<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.100> no<00:02:28.220> possible<00:02:28.700> way

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
single deck now there's no possible way

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.220 
single deck now there's no possible way
of<00:02:28.940> knowing<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.300> course<00:02:29.330> how<00:02:29.660> many<00:02:29.840> cards

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
of knowing of course how many cards

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.420 
of knowing of course how many cards
we've<00:02:30.440> flipped<00:02:30.860> up<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.580> our<00:02:32.270> deck<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.600> cards<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
we've flipped up in our deck of cards so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.640 
we've flipped up in our deck of cards so
what<00:02:35.180> we're<00:02:35.300> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.840> count<00:02:36.080> for<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
what we're going to do is count for the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.280 
what we're going to do is count for the

going to come up with a secret amount of
cards<00:03:31.570> or<00:03:32.570> visualizing<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.980> ace<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.550> clubs

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.199 

okay<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.769> should<00:03:41.799> be<00:03:42.010> enough<00:03:42.640> there<00:03:43.000> now

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
okay that should be enough there now

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.780 
okay that should be enough there now
again<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.019> spectator<00:03:44.470> can<00:03:44.799> choose<00:03:45.519> any

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
again the spectator can choose any

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.280 
again the spectator can choose any
amount<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.180> cards<00:03:46.480> again<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.930> long<00:03:47.049> as<00:03:47.110> it's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
amount of cards again as long as it's

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.899 
amount of cards again as long as it's
the<00:03:47.349> same<00:03:47.409> amount<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:47.920> each<00:03:48.010> packet<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.549> let's

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
the same amount in each packet so let's

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.240 
the same amount in each packet so let's
say<00:03:49.060> they<00:03:49.209> decide<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.510> flip<00:03:49.780> over<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:52.709> 45<00:03:53.709> cards

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
say they decide to flip over to 45 cards

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
say they decide to flip over to 45 cards
this<00:03:54.340> time<00:03:54.400> okay<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:56.230> five<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.680> each<00:03:56.769> packet

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
this time okay so five in each packet

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.490 
this time okay so five in each packet
two<00:03:57.930> three<00:04:00.150> four<00:04:01.150> five<00:04:01.629> cards<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.290> can<00:04:02.409> be

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
two three four five cards so it can be

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.050 
two three four five cards so it can be
any<00:04:02.650> cards<00:04:03.340> within<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.730> packets<00:04:05.640> now<00:04:06.640> we

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
any cards within the packets now we

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.789 
any cards within the packets now we

gather up the cards again and of course

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.399 
gather up the cards again and of course
they<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.459> cut<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.760> remaining<00:04:10.000> cards<00:04:10.299> we<00:04:10.750> join

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
they can cut the remaining cards we join

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.130 
they can cut the remaining cards we join
all<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.739> cards<00:04:12.579> together<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.239> now<00:04:14.079> we're

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
26 the first round this round we have

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:27.210 
26 the first round this round we have
and<00:04:19.000> see<00:04:19.150> how<00:04:19.299> many<00:04:19.359> 2<00:04:20.430> 3<00:04:21.430> 4<00:04:22.210> 5<00:04:23.940> 6<00:04:24.940> 7<00:04:25.539> 8<00:04:25.810> 9<00:04:26.050> 10<00:04:26.830> 11

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 so 32 face up

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.080 
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 so 32 face up
cards<00:04:43.139> okay<00:04:44.139> so<00:04:45.070> now<00:04:45.190> we're<00:04:45.340> going<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.490> add<00:04:45.550> 32

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
cards okay so now we're going to add 32

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.710 
cards okay so now we're going to add 32
2<00:04:46.570> 26<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.320> come<00:04:47.500> up<00:04:47.620> with<00:04:47.740> our<00:04:47.830> grand<00:04:48.250> total<00:04:48.720> so

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
2 26 to come up with our grand total so

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.370 
2 26 to come up with our grand total so
that<00:04:49.840> gives<00:04:49.990> us<00:04:50.340> 58<00:04:52.169> ok<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:53.460> now<00:04:54.460> that's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
that gives us 58 ok so now that's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.810 
that gives us 58 ok so now that's
obviously<00:04:56.380> more<00:04:56.830> than<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.190> amount<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.520> cards

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
obviously more than the amount of cards

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.500 
obviously more than the amount of cards
we<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.300> deck<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.479> cards<00:04:59.580> 58<00:05:00.580> being<00:05:01.120> more

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
we have in a deck of cards 58 being more

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.480 
we have in a deck of cards 58 being more
than<00:05:01.690> 52<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.200> course<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:02.950> there's<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.190> reason

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
than 52 of course now there's a reason

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.020 
than 52 of course now there's a reason
why<00:05:03.639> we<00:05:03.849> had<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.030> potential<00:05:04.419> number<00:05:04.960> to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
why we had the potential number to

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.610 
why we had the potential number to
surpass<00:05:07.030> 52<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.720> mean<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.080> could<00:05:08.169> be<00:05:08.289> less<00:05:08.440> than

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
surpass 52 I mean it could be less than

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.960 
surpass 52 I mean it could be less than
52<00:05:09.039> but<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.440> two<00:05:11.440> rounds<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:12.099> allows<00:05:12.460> us<00:05:12.490> to

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
52 but in two rounds it allows us to

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.629 
52 but in two rounds it allows us to
potentially<00:05:13.720> land<00:05:13.960> on<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.500> top<00:05:14.740> few<00:05:15.039> cards<00:05:15.520> of

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
potentially land on the top few cards of

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.520 
potentially land on the top few cards of
the<00:05:15.669> deck<00:05:15.940> by<00:05:16.180> continuing<00:05:17.020> our<00:05:17.110> account<00:05:17.380> from

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
the deck by continuing our account from

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.920 
the deck by continuing our account from
52<00:05:17.919> from<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.370> bottom<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.270> top<00:05:19.599> of<00:05:19.660> the

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
52 from the bottom to the top of the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.379 
52 from the bottom to the top of the
deck<00:05:20.110> making<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.860> top<00:05:21.099> Kart<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.580> 53rd<00:05:22.090> card

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
deck making the top Kart the 53rd card

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.420 
deck making the top Kart the 53rd card
the<00:05:22.840> second<00:05:23.199> card<00:05:23.349> from<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.530> top<00:05:23.740> 250<00:05:24.130> forth

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
the second card from the top 250 forth

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.300 
the second card from the top 250 forth
and<00:05:24.669> so<00:05:25.060> on<00:05:25.090> ok<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:27.400> we<00:05:27.610> arrived<00:05:28.090> at<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.570> number

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
and so on ok so we arrived at the number

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.740 
and so on ok so we arrived at the number
we<00:05:30.310> added<00:05:30.580> 26<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:33.539> 32<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.710> gave<00:05:35.889> us<00:05:36.220> 58<00:05:37.180> ok

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
we added 26 and 32 so that gave us 58 ok

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.409 
we added 26 and 32 so that gave us 58 ok
so<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:39.280> were<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.460> count<00:05:39.699> through<00:05:40.060> this<00:05:40.180> deck

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
so if we were to count through this deck

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.260 
so if we were to count through this deck
of<00:05:40.539> cards<00:05:40.990> all<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.160> way<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.430> bottom<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.820> 52
