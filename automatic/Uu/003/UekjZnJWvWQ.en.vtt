00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 i 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.720
 no no 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 hello friends for this special of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.240
 halloween I have prepared an arrangement for 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 Acoustic guitar is about tubular 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 mike oldfield's bells is a melody 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 which became very famous because it was included 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 on the soundtrack of the movie 'the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.129
 exorcist 'so surely the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.850
 you know if you like the idea, stay and 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.850
 let's learn it 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.610
 good and this would sound like this 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.660
 and it repeats itself over and over again I 'm going to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 teach in a very easy way the hand 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 we will place it here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 to put the agreement of the minor and in the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.140
 right hand we will place each finger 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 on a rope thumb finger in fifth 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.570
 index in fourth and a half in third and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.500
 cancel in second 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.260
 OK 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 and now I 'm just going to name you the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
 names of the strings 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560
 the number of the rope so you know 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 that we are playing and we are going to start 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.360
 we lift the index finger here from the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 left hand and we're going to press fifth 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.190
 fourth third quarter 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 second fourth 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 and we raise here on third string 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.870
 we lift the ring finger and return to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.950
 give in third string by pressing again 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.950
 so we have 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.679
 i 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.060
 all right 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.060
 do not 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.970
 and now we support here as if it were 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.310
 again the smallest one and we press in fourth 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.410
 second 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.850
 fourth the second but putting the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.670
 little finger on the third fret 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.209
 now fourth again 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.060
 and now second to the second air in 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.520
 first fret 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 and we see again in 4th and go back to 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.740
 start 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.740
 so this part would sound like this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.719
 the last blow the one that makes the link for 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.900
 start over and all together would be 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.900
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.940
 Y 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.440
 i 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.440
 Y 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.480
 well now you have to practice it a 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 little I'm going to make you slow again and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.100
 then one time a little faster 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.819
 but we have said lentito come 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.299
 Y 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.299
 i 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.159
 Y 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.230
 it would be repeated again and again 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.230
 Now I'll make a little faster 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.340
 all right 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.849
 Well, you already have the whole subject 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.280
 remember to practice it little by little it's worth it and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.409
 the most important thing you have given to like 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.310
 at the end of the video just when I 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.249
 disappear 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.239
 I leave you other interesting videos 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.189
 halloween specials so that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.010
 learn to play the melodies more 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.129
 spooky halloween 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.129
 ah
