00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.859 
way um we use this because as pretty as
they<00:01:55.990> are<00:01:56.229> natural<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.880> nice<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.749> them

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
they are natural it's nice to have them

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.300 
they are natural it's nice to have them
a<00:01:58.929> little<00:01:59.200> more<00:01:59.350> durable<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.770> they<00:01:59.979> last<00:02:00.130> a

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
a little more durable so they last a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.219 
a little more durable so they last a
little<00:02:00.460> longer<00:02:00.549> let<00:02:01.389> it<00:02:01.479> really<00:02:01.689> soak<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.139> up

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
little longer let it really soak it up

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.389 
little longer let it really soak it up
mm-hmm

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
mm-hmm

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.690 
mm-hmm
let<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.850> drip<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.569> then<00:02:05.350> make<00:02:06.039> sure<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.429> drain

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
let it drip and then make sure you drain

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.389 
let it drip and then make sure you drain
as<00:02:06.909> much<00:02:06.939> as<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.420> possibly<00:02:07.600> can<00:02:08.229> because<00:02:09.039> if

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
as much as you possibly can because if

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.190 
as much as you possibly can because if
there's<00:02:09.580> any<00:02:09.759> control<00:02:10.299> once<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.659> dry<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.929> yeah

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
there's any control once you dry it yeah

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200 
there's any control once you dry it yeah
twirling<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.799> good<00:02:12.010> Charl

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
twirling it's good Charl

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.880 
twirling it's good Charl
could<00:02:13.330> build<00:02:13.570> up<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.960> leave<00:02:14.080> air<00:02:14.320> bubbles<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
could build up and leave air bubbles and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.920 
could build up and leave air bubbles and
leave<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.670> white<00:02:15.910> residue<00:02:16.360> which<00:02:16.630> we

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
leave kind of a a white residue which we

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.600 
leave kind of a a white residue which we
don't<00:02:17.140> want<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.470> well<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.460> the
