 yes it was a first training where 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 It is important for the boys after three 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.700
 to be back on the ball for weeks and weeks 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 to get in to everything but that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 that 's the place a bit today 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 That was why everything was right 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.479

 preparation for what it will be in the next 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 We plan to be quite busy 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 train twice a day 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 11 and 15 o'clock and will see that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.869
 we just as a team 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 develop football that we do that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.460
 we develop ideas as we do in the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 want to play the second half and of course 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.020
 is always in this phase 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 athletic emphasis that one that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 thank you for the second half 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 I was already very active today 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 in the square see that is to tell 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.469
 you felt very well how was it for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.000
 you today as the first time here at 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.090
 viktoria to stand in the square 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 that was that was good i already got it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.870
 since I introduced you to this 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.180
 Today we are happy that we finally 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.879
 I can finally start with that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 guys and accordingly 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.200
 I felt very well okay 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.250
 now there are 15 in the second half 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.140
 to play games 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.180
 what can you do there what else can you do 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 This is just very difficult 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.290
 because we are not in the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 position that is completely everything 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.980
 determine yourself 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.390
 we focus on it a good one 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.459
 to play a good second 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.060
 to become the team in each one 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.910
 game has the possibility and also the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.430
 form had to win and then 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.930
 let's see what that means to 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.700
 screws must be turned exactly 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 are now looking forward to the front of the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.579
 to prepare for the second half 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.920
 yes, I think that's all 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.010
 It will be important that we are footballing 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.599
 it's good that we think in every game 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.810
 have like low -minded opponents 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.750
 played as we create opportunities 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.640
 how we just build up the game 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.930
 footballing always better in shape too 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.879

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.739
