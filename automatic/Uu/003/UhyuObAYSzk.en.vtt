00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.540
 today a different video there is not a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 video gameplay is not a video of jobs 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 and tonight is another video to ask 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.160
 Sorry to you because I do not have 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.429
 a week in 15 days if you lean and this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.170
 is the video more of explanations also not 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.090
 I wanted to tell you who does not know 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 It's for those who accompany me on twitter to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.190
 who in the company has not kept 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.530
 championship of capture the flag that rolled 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.500
 and on Friday and Saturday 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.410
 So this is for you guys who waited 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.260
 mob friday night and did not roll 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 and I preferred not score ever wished 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 to be training for a couple of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 weeks there that I have trained 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.280
 enough for the catch championship 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.719
 defrec and there is no way to post with 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.609
 so much frequency 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.080
 and it turned out that after Tuesday's 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.600
 last week 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.540
 and I started to train even more, huh? 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 I started to review things for 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.700
 championship 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.969
 My team, right? 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.460
 and it turned out we were training 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.340
 right on time to make no video I 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.950
 I have many videos here to do. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.049
 do not have multiple video game play ideas 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.909
 what to bring to you but not 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.100
 gives to record as many comments as 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.520
 from the issue of what you do not have 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 You'll be home by 16 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.030
 hours and you end up not having time to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.950
 To edit 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.640
 if you have been detail video you do not 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.979
 It's going to play so it's complicated. 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.319
 ends up not giving time to do everything 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.539
 on Thursday I was going to record the maps of 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.090
 Friday night put there we did that 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.990
 opino bine the channel staff 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.759
 so I decided to record sixth however 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.200
 Friday I was resting I was 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.420
 training was preparing me for the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.179
 championship to start and I ended up 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.209
 better head better not to lobby 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.869
 Friday night in a hurry is one way 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.010
 kind of sloppy kind of fast and knows 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.560
 I like to make a video well 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.519
 edited I like to always do the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.239
 comments 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.370
 It's calm and easy and without 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.889
 too rush to comment 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.709
 so I hope you understand the 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:31.540
 which rolled out on Friday the next 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.069
 friday now back to abc this 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 night do not worry 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.420
 is the next episode of the defendant contends that 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.299
 Are you going to return? 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 being prepared then you will have this 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.480
 week and the posting frequency comes back 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.220
 everything to normal 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.470
 It happens that the championship is over 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 so life goes on now 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.290
 quietly 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.240
 the championship is a very cool championship 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.420
 for those who did not have the opportunity to 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.650
 follow or did not know the live stream of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.330
 some games around the arena gameplay went to 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.030
 people played there and such 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.490
 and I think my team is in the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.000
 finals and was seventh or sixth out there 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.900
 I'm not sure right position but 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.050
 It was good, it was a really cool championship. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.430
 many unforeseen things happened in 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.500
 part of my team, right? 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.050
 ended in the quarterfinals and a lot of 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 people fell off my team but that's it 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.130
 happens and I think it was a championship 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.019
 well cool I get a very experience 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.540
 way and I have a novelty to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.480
 bring you there later in the future, huh? 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.280
 and I hope you like it well, this is it 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.070
 That galera is a video to explain 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.360
 For you guys but excuse me for 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.790

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.130
 a thousand moby jobs if tonight wool sixth 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.350
 last week they are ready to go out on 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.420
 next Friday is all it takes to record 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.420
 that comments and editing have already 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.710

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.510

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.820
 and the fight against hunger is also being 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.230
 prepared a point also a video 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.230
 special that will leave 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.410
 second Tuesday I do not know but right now 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.980
 It's all safer, it 's now everything. 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.720
 more and more easy to do staff 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.060
 I'm going to have to train as much as I 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.610
 clan I will not have to devote myself so much 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.340
 so now is a time to rest 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.120
 A lot will be there for a couple of weeks. 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.010
 resting without playing too much 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.830
 competitive part I think there comes a 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.800
 time you have to stop and rest 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.300
 before this is a mostly mental 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.500
 very important part as I say 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.390
 always for you 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.580
 So I'm going to rest and mental play. 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.610
 many public matches and this will 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.070
 bring several cool gameplay 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.440
 several cool videos for you are good 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.320
 It's there that you have apologized. 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.970
