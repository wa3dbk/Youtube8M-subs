00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.379 

I<00:00:08.309> come<00:00:09.309> out<00:00:09.429> is<00:00:09.580> just<00:00:09.670> a<00:00:09.849> quick<00:00:09.940> one

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
I come out is just a quick one

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.170 
I come out is just a quick one
this<00:00:10.629> one<00:00:10.840> was<00:00:11.110> as<00:00:11.410> promised<00:00:12.070> to<00:00:12.879> a<00:00:12.940> number<00:00:13.150> of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
this one was as promised to a number of

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.850 
this one was as promised to a number of
people<00:00:13.330> is<00:00:13.599> how<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.809> spot

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
people is how to spot

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.680 
people is how to spot
binary<00:00:15.220> star<00:00:15.550> systems<00:00:16.180> when<00:00:16.360> you're<00:00:16.480> about<00:00:16.630> to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
binary star systems when you're about to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.740 
binary star systems when you're about to
jump<00:00:16.960> into<00:00:17.230> them<00:00:17.789> okay<00:00:18.789> so<00:00:19.119> I'm<00:00:19.210> in<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.390> galaxy

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
jump into them okay so I'm in the galaxy

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.660 
jump into them okay so I'm in the galaxy
map<00:00:19.900> no<00:00:20.470> need<00:00:20.650> for<00:00:20.800> a<00:00:20.830> tutorial<00:00:21.160> for<00:00:21.400> that<00:00:21.460> I've

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
map no need for a tutorial for that I've

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.500 
map no need for a tutorial for that I've
already<00:00:21.880> done<00:00:22.029> one

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
already done one

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.390 
already done one
now<00:00:22.960> I've<00:00:23.410> just<00:00:23.439> set<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.920> binary<00:00:24.099> system

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
now I've just set to the binary system

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.050 
now I've just set to the binary system
and<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.259> zoom<00:00:26.529> in<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.189> if<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.490> can<00:00:27.640> look

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
and but a zoom in and if you can look

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.859 
and but a zoom in and if you can look
see<00:00:29.009> as<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.160> rotate<00:00:30.640> depending<00:00:31.210> on<00:00:31.630> where<00:00:31.779> you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
see as I rotate depending on where you

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.299 
see as I rotate depending on where you
are<00:00:32.020> of<00:00:32.140> course<00:00:32.320> you<00:00:32.439> can't<00:00:32.680> see<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.040> star

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
are of course you can't see the star

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.330 
are of course you can't see the star
from<00:00:33.520> here<00:00:33.760> but<00:00:33.910> as<00:00:34.000> I<00:00:34.120> rotate<00:00:34.510> around<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:36.010> can

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
from here but as I rotate around you can

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.369 
from here but as I rotate around you can
see<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:36.879> there<00:00:37.059> is<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.330> fact<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.750> very<00:00:37.930> close

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
see that there is in fact a very close

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.390 
see that there is in fact a very close
binary<00:00:39.300> companion<00:00:40.300> star<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.920> if<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.220> was

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
binary companion star so if I was

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.570 
binary companion star so if I was
warping<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.239> in<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:44.440> direction<00:00:44.650> I<00:00:45.309> think<00:00:45.370> you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
warping in in this direction I think you

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.899 
warping in in this direction I think you
get<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.879> idea<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.660> might<00:00:47.589> want<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.920> think<00:00:48.100> bit

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
get the idea you might want to think bit

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.520 
get the idea you might want to think bit
dangerous<00:00:49.540> if<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.809> was<00:00:49.930> coming<00:00:50.199> in<00:00:50.260> at<00:00:50.379> this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
dangerous if I was coming in at this

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.920 
dangerous if I was coming in at this
angle<00:00:50.710> yeah<00:00:51.430> if<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.059> was<00:00:52.150> coming<00:00:52.360> at<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:52.540> angle

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
angle yeah if I was coming at this angle

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.000 
angle yeah if I was coming at this angle
no<00:00:53.140> problem<00:00:53.500> but<00:00:54.430> angle<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.330> might<00:00:55.540> want<00:00:55.809> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
no problem but angle you might want to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.619 
no problem but angle you might want to
think<00:00:57.010> about<00:00:57.220> maybe<00:00:57.699> choosing<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.299> different

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
think about maybe choosing a different

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.450 
think about maybe choosing a different
way<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.809> get<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.229> that<00:00:59.379> star<00:00:59.769> if<00:00:59.979> possible

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
way to get to that star if possible

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.520 
way to get to that star if possible
maybe<00:01:00.699> come<00:01:01.059> from<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.869> this<00:01:02.019> one<00:01:02.080> I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
maybe come from that one to this one I

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.250 
maybe come from that one to this one I
hope<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.129> makes<00:01:03.309> sense<00:01:03.510> let's<00:01:04.510> find<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.989> quick

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
hope that makes sense let's find a quick

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.710 
hope that makes sense let's find a quick
couple<00:01:05.650> more<00:01:05.830> binary<00:01:06.190> systems<00:01:06.970> let's<00:01:07.450> choose

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
couple more binary systems let's choose

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.460 
couple more binary systems let's choose
this<00:01:07.930> one<00:01:07.990> see<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:08.890> we<00:01:09.010> get

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this one see what we get

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640 
this one see what we get
always<00:01:11.470> select<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.090> again<00:01:14.049> this<00:01:14.380> one

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
always select it and again this one

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.190 
always select it and again this one
should<00:01:15.159> be<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.340> binary<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.060> yeah<00:01:16.869> there's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
should be a binary is it yeah there's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.330 
should be a binary is it yeah there's
two<00:01:17.350> stars<00:01:17.680> here<00:01:18.510> zoom<00:01:19.510> right<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:20.170> oh<00:01:20.470> there<00:01:21.190> it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
two stars here zoom right in oh there it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.640 
two stars here zoom right in oh there it
is<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.090> one<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.870> those<00:01:23.020> very<00:01:23.230> common

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
is it's a one of those very common

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.490 
is it's a one of those very common
binary<00:01:24.130> pairs<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.790> again<00:01:25.660> coming<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.350> this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
binary pairs and again coming in this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.150 
binary pairs and again coming in this
from<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:26.980> direction<00:01:27.670> it'll<00:01:28.240> be<00:01:28.450> dangerous

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
from this direction it'll be dangerous

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.350 
from this direction it'll be dangerous
coming<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:30.250> from<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.520> direction<00:01:30.580> you'll<00:01:31.240> be

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
coming in from this direction you'll be

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.600 
coming in from this direction you'll be
fine<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:32.530> quickly<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.160> another<00:01:33.370> one<00:01:33.550> I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
fine it's quickly go to another one I

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.120 
fine it's quickly go to another one I
think<00:01:33.910> you're<00:01:34.000> getting<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.300> idea<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
think you're getting the idea now that's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.890 
think you're getting the idea now that's
not<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> binary<00:01:36.580> star<00:01:36.970> system<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:37.570> that's<00:01:37.690> no

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
not a binary star system so that's no

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.180 
not a binary star system so that's no
appointments<00:01:38.440> go<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.620> that<00:01:38.860> one

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
appointments go to that one

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.120 
appointments go to that one
okay<00:01:40.030> well<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.330> one's<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.600> lot<00:01:40.690> safer<00:01:41.010> as<00:01:42.010> you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
okay well this one's a lot safer as you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.060 
okay well this one's a lot safer as you
can<00:01:42.280> see<00:01:42.460> two<00:01:43.210> stars<00:01:43.510> here's<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.140> star<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.890> main

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
can see two stars here's a star the main

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.510 
can see two stars here's a star the main
star<00:01:45.370> companion<00:01:45.970> star<00:01:46.210> way<00:01:46.990> way<00:01:47.200> away<00:01:47.350> away

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
star companion star way way away away

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.800 
star companion star way way away away
does<00:01:48.520> about<00:01:48.700> which<00:01:49.030> way<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.270> come<00:01:49.480> in<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.690> this

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
does about which way you come in to this

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.060 
does about which way you come in to this
system<00:01:50.020> you're<00:01:50.890> gonna<00:01:51.010> be<00:01:51.280> absolutely<00:01:52.150> fine

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
system you're gonna be absolutely fine

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280 
system you're gonna be absolutely fine
one<00:01:54.070> more<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.640> then<00:01:54.880> I'll<00:01:55.330> do<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.600> think<00:01:56.110> I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
one more and then I'll do I think I

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.840 
one more and then I'll do I think I
think<00:01:56.560> everyone's<00:01:56.830> got<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.010> gym<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.460> do<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.640> know

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
think everyone's got a gym I do you know

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.850 
think everyone's got a gym I do you know
okay<00:01:58.180> it's<00:01:58.360> three<00:01:58.630> stars<00:01:59.050> it's<00:01:59.380> good<00:01:59.590> for<00:01:59.770> that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
okay it's three stars it's good for that

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.580 
okay it's three stars it's good for that
one<00:02:00.750> okay<00:02:01.780> again<00:02:02.080> very<00:02:02.470> straightforward<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
one okay again very straightforward this

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.130 
one okay again very straightforward this
policy<00:02:05.920> will<00:02:06.070> start<00:02:06.280> yeah<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:07.330> system<00:02:07.720> three

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
policy will start yeah this system three

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.420 
policy will start yeah this system three
stars<00:02:08.550> again<00:02:09.550> safe<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.890> warp<00:02:11.890> him<00:02:12.129> from<00:02:12.280> any

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
stars again safe to warp him from any

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.020 
stars again safe to warp him from any
direction<00:02:12.610> there

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
direction there

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.740 
direction there
quite<00:02:14.360> far<00:02:14.660> apart<00:02:15.730> okay<00:02:16.760> um<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:18.290> more<00:02:18.470> then

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
quite far apart okay um one more then

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.680 
quite far apart okay um one more then
let's<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.110> get<00:02:21.260> here<00:02:22.090> come<00:02:23.090> back

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.610 

well<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:26.900> interesting

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
well that's interesting

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.699 
well that's interesting
Wow<00:02:28.250> okay<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.209> yeah<00:02:29.720> wait<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> last

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
Wow okay so yeah wait this the last

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.400 
Wow okay so yeah wait this the last
example<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.390> there's<00:02:32.600> one<00:02:33.530> two<00:02:33.920> three<00:02:33.950> four

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
example so there's one two three four

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.500 
example so there's one two three four
stars<00:02:36.410> M<00:02:37.280> Class<00:02:38.739> 2l<00:02:39.739> class<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.670> T<00:02:40.819> class<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
stars M Class 2l class and a T class and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.160 
stars M Class 2l class and a T class and
look<00:02:42.470> at<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:43.420> that's<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.800> bit<00:02:45.800> scary<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.610> one

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
look at that that's a bit scary that one

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.360 
look at that that's a bit scary that one
trying<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> look<00:02:48.470> around<00:02:48.830> it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
trying to look around it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.280 
trying to look around it
see<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:50.390> as<00:02:50.480> close<00:02:50.720> as<00:02:50.900> possible<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:52.340> yeah

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
see when as close as possible but yeah

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.310 
see when as close as possible but yeah
that's<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.590> nasty<00:02:55.010> system<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.780> don't<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> be

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
that's a nasty system I don't want to be

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320 
that's a nasty system I don't want to be
coming<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.739> from<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.340> direction<00:02:58.400> or<00:02:59.269> from

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
coming in from this direction or from

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.130 
coming in from this direction or from
that<00:02:59.870> direction<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:02.390> get<00:03:02.540> into<00:03:02.750> there<00:03:02.900> cuz

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that direction to get into there cuz

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.199 
that direction to get into there cuz
that<00:03:03.290> that's<00:03:03.560> quite<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:04.010> nasty<00:03:04.489> one<00:03:04.670> could<00:03:05.060> get

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
that that's quite a nasty one could get

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.610 
that that's quite a nasty one could get
caught<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.170> think<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.440> best

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
caught out on that one I think the best

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.430 
caught out on that one I think the best
way<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.920> will<00:03:07.040> be<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.670> from<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.269> star<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:09.260> that

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
way it will be in from this star to that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.559 
way it will be in from this star to that
star<00:03:09.769> there<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:11.090> go

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
star there we go

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.559 
star there we go
I<00:03:11.600> hope<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.350> helps<00:03:12.970> one<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.150> stars<00:03:14.420> I

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
I hope that helps one of the stars I

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.880 
I hope that helps one of the stars I
can't<00:03:14.810> even<00:03:14.930> see<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> think<00:03:15.650> he's

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
can't even see on that I think he's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.770 
can't even see on that I think he's
close<00:03:16.250> by<00:03:16.519> on<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.880> external<00:03:17.180> one<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.600> but

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
close by on that external one there but

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.860 
close by on that external one there but
there<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.019> that's<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.120> how<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> spot<00:03:20.630> a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
there we go that's it how to spot a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.390 
there we go that's it how to spot a
dangerous<00:03:21.640> or<00:03:23.079> potentially<00:03:24.079> dangerous<00:03:24.400> star

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
dangerous or potentially dangerous star

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.090 
dangerous or potentially dangerous star
system<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.239> jump<00:03:26.420> into<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.620> best<00:03:27.890> way<00:03:28.070> to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
system to jump into and the best way to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.910 
system to jump into and the best way to
avoid<00:03:28.660> warping<00:03:29.660> out<00:03:30.049> in<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.470> middle<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.829> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
avoid warping out in the middle of a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.310 
avoid warping out in the middle of a
star<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.430> find<00:03:31.820> out<00:03:31.940> useful<00:03:32.329> catch<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.230> on

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
star you find out useful catch you on

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.180 
star you find out useful catch you on
