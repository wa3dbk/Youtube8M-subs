00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello and welcome to each 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 a very short video 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.210
 I read something on facebook 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 what I did not want to withhold from you 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.400
 and that's what I found again 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.810
 on honest online german on the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.330
 fanseite I already have a few 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 have mentioned and there is someone 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 elia team contacted and has 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.369
 asked when so momentary of the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.180
 release date as of its publication date 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.059
 is targeted and it assures him he has 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 actually written on it that the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 minimum date that the earliest possible 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.550
 in march, that would be the whole thing 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 has moved forward, it says 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.610
 it moved so forward 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.910
 you know that I mean it's up 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.199
 each case already attached earlier 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 Targeted as a few weeks ago 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 So it looks like the team is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.880
 much better to get ahead 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 would bored the team by a bland 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.180
 still progressing much faster than 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.830
 it was originally planned 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 so I think now I personally times 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 just take it for granted 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 that with the first statement that already 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 time was with maite again 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 So it could be relatively good 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.200
 It may well be that game much earlier 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.009
 comes out as it was now last I was called 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.689
 I am very curious what we have to do 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.759
 maybe in the coming days or maybe 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 weeks even let them hear but one time 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.020
 comment because there was so much for her 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.299
 probably keep from the updates 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 it's already a lot 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the meantime 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.490
 actually only the shop is missing 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.950
 race and breed 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.570
 I'm curious how fast she gets that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.470
 now make it into the game 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.329
 to implement 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 but as I said now you are asked 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.189
 you write the comments purely what you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.000
 of this news and what you think 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.829
 for most likely looks up so 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.829
 to the next mixer video chips
