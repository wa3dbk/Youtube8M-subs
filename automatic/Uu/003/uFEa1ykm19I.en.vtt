00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.459
 today is the biggest defeat on the planet 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.690
 nuclear research laboratories convened 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.520
 emergency symposium to discuss 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.620
 sensational discovery which seemed 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.870
 incredible even to those who committed it 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.509
 scientists recorded speeding 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.359
 light faster which was thought to be an element 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.710
 matte therefore has nothing 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.480
 however now if the result 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 experiment will confirm the other 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.519
 laboratory of the theory of relativity on 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160
 the skating rink on which the whole is built 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.449
 modern physics 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.130
 can be refuted as 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.410
 our ideas about world order 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.489
 fearing their own conclusions center scientists 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.510
 nuclear research turned to colleagues 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.760
 skeptics such as the testimony of Sergei 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 there was a lot of frost 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.200
 three years in the European center 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 nuclear research switzerland scientists 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.460
 studied neutrinos until finally in March of this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.740
 years they remembered 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.859
 wait a second why are they flying so fast 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.309
 half a year experts checked the results 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.209
 used atomic clocks and satellite 

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:57.199
 coordinate system studied 15 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.299
 thousand particle flights finally today 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.920
 scientists have recognized the us all the longer 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.729
 maybe but we don't know where we could 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:04.660
 make a mistake 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.450
 they hold an internet conference to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480
 discuss a discovery that may 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.730
 shake all modern theory 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.560
 devices 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.620
 to the makad 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.730
 Tyumen on the theory of Einstein particles not 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.860
 can move faster than speed 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.950
 light on this is our 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.440
 idea of ​​time and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.650
 space and if others are received 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.660
 results and therefore reality is arranged 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.729
 not at all as we expected 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.149
 in the general experiment switzerland by 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.240
 complex manipulation tsymbalyuk beam 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 neutrino and directs it underground 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580
 exactly aside the lab in Italy 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.430
 neutrino easily overcomes any 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.470
 obstacles and going 730 kilometers under 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.560
 in milliseconds 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.650
 find themselves in the underground area 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.290
 laboratories at a depth of one and a half 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 kilometers where they are registered with 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.710
 using photo plates of lead 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.210
 the whole installation weighs almost two thousand tons 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120
 so here scientists have calculated that if 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.370
 would conditionally particles of light on this 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.390
 distance ran to race with her 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.910
 trina then neutrino came to be first with 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.220
 20 meters advantage in this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.740
 experiment took part and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.890
 Russian physicists together with their colleagues 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.820
 observed these inexplicable 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.390
 the result is 100 km so 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.449
 so unexpected 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.099
 yes amazing result what if 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.799
 it will be correct 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.239
 not confirmed 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.989
 this will be 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.359
 revolution 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.129
 it will be new 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.989
 during the holidays 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.429
 all i can say 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.609
 if the experiment results are correct 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.069
 noted on the shoulders of the answer to 8 thousand 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.349
 kilometers per second faster than light 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.709
 the speed of light is almost 300 thousand kilometers in 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.689
 second these mysterious particles 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.450
 for the second time hit 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.790
 modern physics the first time was then 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.749
 it turned out that neutrinos have 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.510
 some kind of mass standard model 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 stated that they should be resolved 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.919
 mass solo artist data on 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.060
 particles that do not interact 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 they fly the earth completely unnoticed 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.999
 every second for example permeates you 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.550
 400 million neutrino demolitions ounce 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.300
 these are the most numerous of 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.360
 the least studied particles in our 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 the universe of the participant experiment tatyana 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.460
 roganova says that in this discovery 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.190
 great is the role of Russian scientists 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.250
 about one in five researchers was from 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.250
 Russia 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.909
 including five years 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.129
 percent 8 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.779
 most patients 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.229
 the decision was made 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.389
 analysis results 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.219
 straining 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.689
 there is a true assumption that 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.659
 neutrinos actually flew they 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.539
 faster than the speed of light but somehow 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.599
 tied distances having traveled in others 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.430
 unknown to us measurement 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.000
 the fact that Dmitry will run too 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.950
 scientists quickly noticed earlier 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.989
 labs in chicago but they also don't 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.560
 they believed their eyes and the errors 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.019
 measurements was too big now 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.349
 there is a chance that the theory of relativity 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.269
 Einstein standing shushi 100 years will have 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.799
 rewrite will provide Sergei 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.930
 frost and light Ivan Kongars mound
