around<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> world<00:03:14.250> no<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.880> think<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.330> it's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
around the world no I think it's it's

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.770 
around the world no I think it's it's
pretty<00:03:15.900> hard<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.700> compare<00:03:17.810> errors<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:21.030> ya<00:03:21.540> mean

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
pretty hard to compare errors so ya mean

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.530 
pretty hard to compare errors so ya mean
is<00:03:21.960> definitely<00:03:22.680> i<00:03:22.890> guess<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> results<00:03:24.390> show

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
is definitely i guess the results show

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
is definitely i guess the results show
that<00:03:24.570> he's<00:03:24.840> definitely<00:03:25.200> been<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.770> best<00:03:26.090> of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that he's definitely been the best of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.900 
that he's definitely been the best of
this<00:03:27.630> era<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.500> know<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:28.770> so<00:03:28.920> hard<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
this era but you know it's so hard to to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.040 
this era but you know it's so hard to to
compare<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.020> past<00:03:31.230> ah<00:03:31.640> mantic<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:33.050> to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
compare to to the past ah mantic to to

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.960 
compare to to the past ah mantic to to
compare<00:03:34.440> across<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.800> generations<00:03:34.970> it's

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
compare across the generations it's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760 
compare across the generations it's
impossible<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.600> do<00:03:36.810> how<00:03:37.050> can<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.320> compare<00:03:37.620> him

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
impossible to do how can you compare him

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.320 
impossible to do how can you compare him
against<00:03:38.070> peter<00:03:38.459> brock<00:03:38.670> from<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> late

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
against peter brock from the late

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.090 
against peter brock from the late
eighties<00:03:39.810> or<00:03:39.900> though<00:03:40.080> when<00:03:40.680> he<00:03:40.800> had<00:03:41.070> his

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
eighties or though when he had his

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.540 
eighties or though when he had his
career<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.730> he<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.720> can't<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.550> he's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
career and he just can't so he's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.949 
career and he just can't so he's
obviously<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.030> driver<00:03:45.240> of<00:03:45.360> his<00:03:45.540> time<00:03:45.750> at<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
obviously the driver of his time at the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.630 
obviously the driver of his time at the
moment<00:03:46.080> but<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.860> compare<00:03:47.160> across<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
moment but to compare across the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.670 
moment but to compare across the
generations<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.390> wouldn't<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.140> he's<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.590> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
generations I wouldn't do it he's in a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.260 
generations I wouldn't do it he's in a
very<00:03:49.709> good<00:03:50.070> team<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.459> very<00:03:50.640> good<00:03:50.850> car<00:03:51.060> which

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
very good team in a very good car which

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.540 
very good team in a very good car which
certainly<00:03:51.630> helps<00:03:51.690> him<00:03:52.140> but<00:03:52.290> his<00:03:52.590> personal

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
certainly helps him but his personal

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.670 
certainly helps him but his personal
dedication<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.300> drive<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.260> job<00:03:55.500> at<00:03:55.650> hand

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
dedication and drive to the job at hand

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.850 
dedication and drive to the job at hand
is<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:57.390> at<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.750> moment<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.170> think<00:03:58.440> second<00:03:58.800> to

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
is is at the moment I think second to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.500 
is is at the moment I think second to
none<00:03:59.010> certainly<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> best<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.270> last

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
none certainly the best in the last

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.220 
none certainly the best in the last
decade<00:04:01.040> it's<00:04:02.040> no<00:04:02.600> it's<00:04:03.600> no<00:04:03.690> accident<00:04:03.930> you

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
decade it's no it's no accident you

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.660 
decade it's no it's no accident you
don't<00:04:04.380> win<00:04:04.470> four<00:04:04.680> championships<00:04:05.250> out<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.520> five

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
don't win four championships out of five

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.780 
don't win four championships out of five
years<00:04:05.850> by<00:04:06.180> accident<00:04:06.630> he's<00:04:07.620> clearly<00:04:07.860> very<00:04:08.190> very

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
years by accident he's clearly very very

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.140 
years by accident he's clearly very very
much<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:09.060> top<00:04:09.240> of<00:04:09.360> his<00:04:09.450> game<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.959> he's<00:04:11.150> using

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
much on top of his game and he's using

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.570 
much on top of his game and he's using
the<00:04:12.390> momentum<00:04:13.350> has<00:04:13.770> gotten<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> confidence

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
the momentum has gotten the confidence

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.680 
the momentum has gotten the confidence
he's<00:04:14.700> gotten<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.120> he's<00:04:15.209> he's<00:04:15.510> still

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
he's gotten and he's he's still

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.120 
he's gotten and he's he's still
improving<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.320> driver<00:04:16.560> which<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.950> always

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
improving as a driver which is always

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.280 
improving as a driver which is always
good<00:04:17.520> from<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> team<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.180> see<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.750> he's

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
good from a team to see and he's

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.650 
good from a team to see and he's
dedicated<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.190> ever<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:21.060> going<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.270> take<00:04:21.630> a

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
dedicated as ever it's going to take a

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.840 
dedicated as ever it's going to take a
class<00:04:21.900> act<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.380> him<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:23.130> topple<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:23.790> the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
class act to him to topple in but at the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.130 
class act to him to topple in but at the
moment<00:04:23.940> he's<00:04:24.450> definitely<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.870> best<00:04:24.960> out

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
moment he's definitely the best out

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.750 
moment he's definitely the best out
there<00:04:25.169> at<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.410> moment<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.400> team's

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
there at the moment I think the team's

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.450 
there at the moment I think the team's
doing<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> great<00:04:27.330> job<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.900> he's<00:04:28.220> he's<00:04:29.220> also

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
doing a great job and he's he's also

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.000 
doing a great job and he's he's also
doing<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.880> good<00:04:30.300> job<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.720> think<00:04:30.860> best-ever<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
doing a good job I think best-ever is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.310 
doing a good job I think best-ever is
probably<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.340> big<00:04:32.520> call<00:04:32.760> we<00:04:33.240> rebid<00:04:34.169> him<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
probably a big call we rebid him a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.930 
probably a big call we rebid him a
couple<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.620> years<00:04:34.650> ago<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.100> same<00:04:35.340> car<00:04:35.610> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
couple of years ago with the same car so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:55.930 
couple of years ago with the same car so
see<00:04:36.780> ya<00:04:36.900> best<00:04:37.890> ever<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.190> be<00:04:38.310> cool

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.000
