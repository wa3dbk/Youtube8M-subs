00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.720
 after seeing the load I will show you that you are simply using 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.539
 first this device goals and a goal 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.679
 shots

 photo the goal of the elysée 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.500
 which serves to focus on depoliticizing this purpose they are 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.070
 protected 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.169
 matthias schepp 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
 an extremely important accessory since it helps to protect 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.089
 the Swiss group 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.329
 fingerprints when you manipulate particular to reload 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 secondly protects them from scratches in the transport 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.480
 as for the second by removing 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.580
 takahashi 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.400
 like all the accessories that are not on the lenses 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 they are who does not know what you can put a picture of the shoot 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 in tournament and he's going to sit down simply stands by loved ones 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 we can even in position 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.960
 that on the side it does not turn around us 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.720
 he fixes himself 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.710
 then immediately 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.800
 the case at andré 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.250
 I put in place 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.930
 a sun visor 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 this accessory is also extremely important 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.440
 I wish them right away 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 gentlemen also wants to protect the goal 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.360
 since freshwater type of shooting that can vary from a plot to 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.480
 protect the goal 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.070
 the shots 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.080
 also against fingerprints the limits you owe me for seeing myself 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.980
 propose a little more the same 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.040
 and above all he would have stung her image 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.470
 avoiding a few minutes of excessive light 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.390
 we go back to the goal 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 Elisabeth these technical constraints 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 from the device is ready to be used 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.020
 he's charged 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.390
 there was no birth certificate of the movie unlock 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.070
 which means that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.540
 the curator is charged he is allowed too 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.800
 cutting cups 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 so is how 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 first 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.900
 the big briefcase 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.130
 on the left side 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 cerep is dealing with a need for points 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 referenced the decline in the workforce 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.070
 the triggering 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.080
 Kitambala 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.219
 let's leave on the index 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.339
 the two wheels 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.809
 to the right and to the left 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.269
 goals every employee lee the diaphragm the speed the left 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.989
 the diaphragm 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.849
 to the right 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.939
 we observe 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.400
 the misfortune of defragmenting speed selected in a small window 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 which is above the objectives 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.419
 on the right side on the same dates of absence of the film 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.419
 the goal counter 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.919
 which protects the lithium deposit of the amf pupils which allows to aim the 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:42.889
 focus 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.609
 source ap the mood over the entire year 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.249
 and closes the way by probably pushing the population 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.379
 so we get the device on Sunday 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.179
 patients are the most common around the neck 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.420
 the goal is to knock down 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.969
 I had Nicolet hands against us 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.609
 many heritage 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.769
 and we look 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:04.909
 in wheels 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:05.999
 Why 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.199
 the deposit to make them focus 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.009
 the case against metz 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.309
 the bce sees very well on cinemaginaire cars 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.229
 the subject is almost intact 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.059
 bring an image 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 shining on the podiums 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.469
 when we look from the top we see at the same time the image of paul p the little 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.249
 window 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 québec the speed values ​​of oars composed of girls 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.299
 when we take a picture shown incapable like that all the commands 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.739
 fall naturally under the fingers 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.929
 we can change all women speed 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.589
 close to the point 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.499
 triggered 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.659
 these claim to be 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.150
 the first thing we lose we take a picture this little camera this camera 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.510
 had to give 50 that can not be useful mechanical tension there is no 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.199
 cellular 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.009
 we will improve links with a cell at one time or another 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.459
 wallerand device of external stimulations 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.410
 they were sequestered 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.519
 destined 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.430
 rowers speed robbers for a half sensitivity film 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.669
 if not take a hand cell that can be a modern cell like that 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.739
 difficult to him his duties 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.569
 to adjust the sensitivity 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.879
 of the movie 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.090
 in the cells 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.409
 eight 8 years it lasts 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.050
 world Cup 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.439
 I have the subject what gives me 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.289
 high speed derailed 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.930
 here two points 4 a second group for a film of 400 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.650
 - the group 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.110
 these values 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.960
 Patients must be led from the left of the shot the diaphragm 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.740
 which is of course 4 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
 we the right for the ps 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.189
 the 15th congress 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.389
 more than double the figure 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.490
 its this es6 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.460
 ten days 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 multiple published studies 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.749
 to conclude the busy light and light 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.749
 besides setting time in canada 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.150
 in the second 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 we trigger 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.469
 but it's got a complete film equipment was brought forward on 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:16.990
 view counter and reviews 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.479
 for the Persian New Year 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.909
 reverse 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.009
 and yet I repaired the rest a photo if we want to enchain love of 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.089
 remind him that 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.919
 because that 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.960
 keeping the same green range we learn so conclusively 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.860
 they triggered 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.860
 however, the return gently 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.960
 without really moving your hands 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.599
 that's it 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.099
 for patrice luzi 5
