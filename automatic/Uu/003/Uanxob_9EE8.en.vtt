two and three and four and one now you
don't<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> play<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> bass<00:00:53.610> drum<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
don't just have to play the bass drum on

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
don't just have to play the bass drum on
beats<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.350> snare<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.649> two

and<00:00:56.100> four<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> point<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.300> started<00:00:57.690> out

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and four at this point we started out

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.939 
and four at this point we started out
like<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> most<00:00:58.710> basic

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
like that because that's the most basic

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.229 
like that because that's the most basic
pattern<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> learn<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
pattern to learn and you do want to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
pattern to learn and you do want to
learn<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
learn to do that first but here we can

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.680 
learn to do that first but here we can
mix<00:01:02.489> around<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> bass<00:01:03.030> drum<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.570> bit

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
mix around the bass drum a little bit

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190 
mix around the bass drum a little bit
let's<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.610> two<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.510> three<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
let's go with one and two and three and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.640 
let's go with one and two and three and
four<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.260> play<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
four and one now when we do play the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170 
four and one now when we do play the
bass<00:01:10.799> drum<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.130> different<00:01:11.520> eighth<00:01:11.670> notes<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
bass drum on different eighth notes and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
bass drum on different eighth notes and
we're<00:01:12.450> already<00:01:12.630> playing<00:01:12.990> eighth<00:01:13.170> notes<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we're already playing eighth notes on

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
we're already playing eighth notes on
the<00:01:13.650> hi-hat<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.970> sure<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the hi-hat we need to make sure that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
the hi-hat we need to make sure that
when<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.659> play<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.020> both<00:01:16.170> together<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
when we play them both together that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460 
when we play them both together that
they<00:01:16.920> land<00:01:17.189> exactly<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> they

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
they land exactly in time so that they

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
they land exactly in time so that they
learned<00:01:19.740> exactly<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.850> top<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> each<00:01:21.270> other<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
learned exactly on top of each other and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
learned exactly on top of each other and
not<00:01:21.930> flamming<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.920> either<00:01:23.100> side<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
not flamming from either side so you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.310 
not flamming from either side so you
want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> make<00:01:24.360> sure<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> play<00:01:25.290> this
