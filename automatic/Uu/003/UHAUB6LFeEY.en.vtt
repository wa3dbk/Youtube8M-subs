00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
really a natty power in my opinion um

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.070 
really a natty power in my opinion um
it's<00:02:02.550> got<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> pretty<00:02:03.270> standard<00:02:03.660> striking

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
it's got a pretty standard striking

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's got a pretty standard striking
element<00:02:04.410> they<00:02:04.680> kind<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> went<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.220> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
element they kind of went for a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.449 
element they kind of went for a
lightweight<00:02:05.640> shoe<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.860> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
lightweight shoe on this one like I like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.919 
lightweight shoe on this one like I like
where<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.729> went<00:02:08.909> but<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.269> not<00:02:09.390> sure<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
where they went but I'm not sure that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
where they went but I'm not sure that
it's<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> power<00:02:10.649> boot<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.220> point<00:02:11.430> I

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it's really a power boot at this point I

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
it's really a power boot at this point I
think<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.480> D<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
think it's just the D this is so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.839 
think it's just the D this is so
consumed<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.890> being<00:02:13.920> lightweight<00:02:14.519> that

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
consumed with being lightweight that

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.970 
consumed with being lightweight that
they're<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.019> disregarding<00:02:16.620> quality

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
they're kind of disregarding quality

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.050 
they're kind of disregarding quality
which<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.160> probably<00:02:17.520> why<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
which is probably why you see the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.760 
which is probably why you see the
durability<00:02:18.390> issues<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
durability issues and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.230 
durability issues and
has<00:02:19.890> been<00:02:20.040> rumors<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.550> around<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.910> fixed

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
has been rumors going around they fixed

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240 
has been rumors going around they fixed
it<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> new<00:02:21.660> colorways<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:22.920> true<00:02:23.130> at

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
don't just fix stuff like that if they

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.680 
don't just fix stuff like that if they
have<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> wait<00:02:28.080> till<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> new<00:02:28.440> shoe<00:02:29.600> that's<00:02:30.600> a

little bit of that it is the lightest by

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
little bit of that it is the lightest by

like you see here and the synthetic

similar all three of these shoes are
just<00:04:47.660> really<00:04:47.810> notices<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.500> they<00:04:49.250> were<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.760> know

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
just really notices now they were I know

just really notices now they were I know
a<00:04:50.660> lot<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:50.930> guys<00:04:51.020> are<00:04:51.200> thinking<00:04:51.290> oh<00:04:51.500> they

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
a lot of you guys are thinking oh they

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.530 
a lot of you guys are thinking oh they
copied<00:04:52.280> IATI<00:04:52.550> powers<00:04:52.970> cuz<00:04:53.180> they<00:04:53.270> came<00:04:53.420> out

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
copied IATI powers cuz they came out

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.420 
copied IATI powers cuz they came out
first<00:04:53.720> that's<00:04:54.350> not<00:04:54.470> true<00:04:54.770> at<00:04:54.890> all<00:04:55.040> these<00:04:55.250> shoes

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430

first that's not true at all these shoes
have<00:04:55.580> been<00:04:55.670> in<00:04:55.790> development<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.540> would<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.410> would

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
have been in development I would I would

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.530 
have been in development I would I would
think<00:04:57.770> for<00:04:57.980> minimum<00:04:58.730> at<00:04:58.910> least<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.180> year<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.480> a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
think for minimum at least a year and a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.000 
think for minimum at least a year and a
half<00:04:59.720> before<00:05:00.050> they<00:05:00.350> actually<00:05:00.500> get<00:05:00.740> released

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
half before they actually get released

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.040 
half before they actually get released
so<00:05:01.130> nobody's<00:05:01.460> copying<00:05:01.910> anybody<00:05:02.240> but<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:02.900> just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
so nobody's copying anybody but I just

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.620 
so nobody's copying anybody but I just
think<00:05:03.140> it's<00:05:03.320> funny<00:05:03.530> how<00:05:03.710> similarly<00:05:04.630> styled

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
think it's funny how similarly styled

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.190 
think it's funny how similarly styled
the<00:05:06.050> power<00:05:06.260> boots<00:05:06.560> have<00:05:06.740> become<00:05:07.420> just<00:05:08.420> even

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
the power boots have become just even

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.530 
the power boots have become just even
just<00:05:09.590> look<00:05:09.740> at<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.890> laces<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.540> everything

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
just look at the laces and everything

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.270 
just look at the laces and everything
right<00:05:11.720> um<00:05:12.380> something<00:05:12.860> that's<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.010> little<00:05:13.160> bit

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
right um something that's a little bit

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.400 
right um something that's a little bit
different<00:05:13.580> about<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:14.020> power<00:05:15.020> cats<00:05:15.260> that<00:05:15.350> you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
different about the power cats that you

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.110 
different about the power cats that you
might<00:05:15.560> notice<00:05:15.740> right<00:05:15.860> away<00:05:15.920> is<00:05:16.070> how<00:05:16.700> low<00:05:16.940> the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
might notice right away is how low the

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.390 
might notice right away is how low the
striking<00:05:17.420> element<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.710> striking<00:05:18.950> element

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
striking element is the striking element

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.490 
striking element is the striking element
on<00:05:19.550> laser<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.360> ADI<00:05:20.540> powers<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.140> this

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
on laser and the ADI powers in this

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.520 
on laser and the ADI powers in this
general<00:05:21.980> higher<00:05:22.460> up<00:05:22.730> region<00:05:23.210> where<00:05:24.110> on<00:05:24.320> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
general higher up region where on the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.600 
general higher up region where on the
the<00:05:25.250> power<00:05:25.730> cat<00:05:25.940> they<00:05:26.090> put<00:05:26.420> it<00:05:26.510> a<00:05:26.600> lot<00:05:26.750> lower<00:05:27.050> I

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
the power cat they put it a lot lower I

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.130 
the power cat they put it a lot lower I
found<00:05:28.610> that<00:05:28.790> when<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:29.540> are<00:05:29.660> striking<00:05:29.960> the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
found that when you are striking the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
found that when you are striking the
ball<00:05:30.260> really<00:05:30.410> hard<00:05:30.500> you're<00:05:30.710> gonna<00:05:30.830> end<00:05:31.070> up

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
ball really hard you're gonna end up

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.920 
ball really hard you're gonna end up
hitting<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.550> ball<00:05:31.730> probably<00:05:32.510> about<00:05:32.780> right

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
hitting the ball probably about right

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.750 
hitting the ball probably about right
here<00:05:33.140> but<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:33.800> are<00:05:33.920> like<00:05:34.070> into<00:05:34.430> like<00:05:34.580> free

you're<00:05:42.320> going<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.530> hit<00:05:42.650> this<00:05:42.800> this<00:05:43.190> element

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
you're going to hit this this element

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.310 
you're going to hit this this element
more<00:05:43.850> often<00:05:44.240> than<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.510> will<00:05:44.630> on<00:05:44.810> these<00:05:44.990> I

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
found it to be a little bit a little bit

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.080 
found it to be a little bit a little bit
better<00:05:48.080> and<00:05:48.380> like<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:48.980> said<00:05:49.160> have<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.370> really

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
go check out the review it just went up

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.150 
go check out the review it just went up
today<00:05:51.410> guys<00:05:52.570> this<00:05:53.570> this<00:05:54.050> striking<00:05:54.650> element<00:05:55.010> on

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
today guys this this striking element on

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.210 
today guys this this striking element on
the<00:05:55.310> 1.12<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.150> even<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.450> power<00:05:56.720> cat<00:05:56.930> 1.10<00:05:57.470> to

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
the 1.12 and even the power cat 1.10 to

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.000 
the 1.12 and even the power cat 1.10 to
me<00:05:58.310> is<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.640> best<00:05:59.260> kind<00:06:00.260> of<00:06:00.320> technology

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
me is the best kind of technology

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.070 
me is the best kind of technology
implemented<00:06:01.400> on<00:06:01.700> any<00:06:01.850> soccer<00:06:02.180> shoe<00:06:02.480> how<00:06:03.050> I

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
implemented on any soccer shoe how I

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.270 
implemented on any soccer shoe how I
explained<00:06:03.440> it<00:06:03.560> really<00:06:03.740> well<00:06:03.860> in<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.040> review

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
explained it really well in the review

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.220 
explained it really well in the review
I'm<00:06:04.370> not<00:06:04.460> going<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.640> go<00:06:04.700> into<00:06:04.850> detail<00:06:05.210> but<00:06:05.420> it's

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
I'm not going to go into detail but it's

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.990 
I'm not going to go into detail but it's
not<00:06:06.380> so<00:06:06.530> much<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.860> rubber<00:06:07.070> element<00:06:07.610> it's<00:06:07.790> the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
not so much the rubber element it's the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.520 
not so much the rubber element it's the
material<00:06:08.450> underneath<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.990> rubber<00:06:09.140> element

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
material underneath the rubber element

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.420 
material underneath the rubber element
which<00:06:09.650> is<00:06:09.800> like<00:06:09.950> called<00:06:10.670> Puma<00:06:11.060> 3d<00:06:11.540> PST<00:06:12.310> if<00:06:13.310> the

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
which is like called Puma 3d PST if the

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.040 
which is like called Puma 3d PST if the
special<00:06:13.760> material<00:06:13.880> has<00:06:14.300> very<00:06:14.540> low<00:06:14.690> rebound

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
special material has very low rebound

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.370 
special material has very low rebound
properties<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:16.220> basically<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:17.380> it

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
properties and basically it it

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.020 
properties and basically it it
eliminates<00:06:18.590> most<00:06:19.100> of<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.490> power<00:06:19.760> loss

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
eliminates most of the power loss

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.430 
eliminates most of the power loss
between<00:06:20.270> your<00:06:20.570> foot<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:20.930> ball<00:06:21.110> when<00:06:21.350> the

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
between your foot and the ball when the

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.470 
between your foot and the ball when the
ball<00:06:21.470> leaves<00:06:21.800> your<00:06:21.950> foot<00:06:22.160> when<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.120> shoot<00:06:23.330> the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
ball leaves your foot when you shoot the

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.600 
ball leaves your foot when you shoot the
ball<00:06:23.770> I'm<00:06:24.770> just<00:06:24.980> a<00:06:25.010> little<00:06:25.130> bit<00:06:25.340> about<00:06:25.460> the

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
ball I'm just a little bit about the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.700 
ball I'm just a little bit about the
shoe<00:06:25.790> again<00:06:26.000> full<00:06:26.690> kangaroo<00:06:27.020> leather<00:06:27.170> on<00:06:27.530> the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
shoe again full kangaroo leather on the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.080 
shoe again full kangaroo leather on the
front<00:06:27.950> it's<00:06:28.160> only<00:06:28.430> available<00:06:28.730> on<00:06:28.790> kangaroo

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
front it's only available on kangaroo

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.720 
front it's only available on kangaroo
leather<00:06:29.210> right<00:06:29.450> now<00:06:29.570> but<00:06:29.810> I'm<00:06:29.900> sure<00:06:30.230> that<00:06:30.730> Puma

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
leather right now but I'm sure that Puma

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.580 
leather right now but I'm sure that Puma
will<00:06:31.970> be<00:06:32.000> releasing<00:06:32.600> a<00:06:32.810> second<00:06:33.260> version

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
will be releasing a second version

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.830 
will be releasing a second version
that's<00:06:34.250> not<00:06:34.520> confirmed<00:06:34.970> but<00:06:35.210> I'm<00:06:35.330> pretty<00:06:35.750> sure

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
that's not confirmed but I'm pretty sure

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.960 
that's not confirmed but I'm pretty sure
it's<00:06:36.050> going<00:06:36.140> to<00:06:36.200> happen<00:06:36.370> so<00:06:37.370> I'll<00:06:37.700> be<00:06:37.820> on<00:06:37.910> the

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
it's going to happen so I'll be on the

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.620 
it's going to happen so I'll be on the
lookout<00:06:38.240> for<00:06:38.300> that

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
lookout for that

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.290 
lookout for that
um<00:06:39.460> material<00:06:40.460> on<00:06:40.520> the<00:06:40.610> inside<00:06:40.730> is<00:06:41.000> pretty<00:06:41.150> much

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
um material on the inside is pretty much
