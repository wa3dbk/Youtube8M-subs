00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.680
 a new episode wont be funny 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.680
 I have birthday today 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.790
 so now where a bit decorated here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.139
 I thought I would take it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 my birthday must be as a hanger 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.780
 for this video 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.520
 because when I was born 19 years ago 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 was also recorded which 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.699
 Eye color or which hair color I use 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.590
 example my parents could 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.100
 at that time no real influence on it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.720
 to take 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.920
 but maybe that will change soon 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 the future with the next parents 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
 Generation genetic modification 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.990
 make it possible 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.160
 what if I were to look after my child 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.160
 be able to shape preferences 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.120
 a few weeks ago they have it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.270
 managed chinese scientists 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 could for the very first time ever 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.360
 genetically altering human embryos 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.739
 and since you got your results 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.720
 the world of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 science head now to clarify that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.900
 These are embryos that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.699
 no longer a human 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.650
 could grow up but what is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.059
 actually happened 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.040
 the scientists have succeeded 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 a small sequence from the dns of the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.449
 embryos removed this small part of the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 dns is for a deadly blood disorder 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.780
 responsible if the embryos are now too 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.000
 grown up to a real man 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 If these people were immune then 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 been against this disease around that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.910
 the scientists have to get there 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 from china a novel technique called 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.080
 chris uses it sounds pretty pretty first 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 But evil is based on a process 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 nature is similar to bacteria 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 Virus protection is here with the help of a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.979
 Enzyme's part of the DNs code 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.660
 cut out 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 responsible for the disease 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.950
 the simple cut out of the dns 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 was also previously missing only so far 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.210
 always a knife that was small enough and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.830
 especially precise enough was around the part 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.690
 to remove the dns that was important 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.459
 without other important parts of the code 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.170
 to touch those at all 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.209
 Applied technology should but for all 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.330
 types of cells even work for 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.800
 stem cells and according to the scientist 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.179
 it may even be possible in the future 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.190
 not only possible diseases 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.929
 remove but also attributes like 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.500
 intelligence and attractiveness too 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.509
 increase 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.160
 Many other scientists warn 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.720
 before that with the genetic change 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.819
 to experiment with people 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.190
 some even demand that temporary 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.440
 banned by chris byrd until we get better 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.849
 understand what we were supposed to do because 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.069
 at the moment is not always the right one 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.510
 dns cabinet will sometimes be removed 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.670
 also other parts of the dns out 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.599
 cut or altered that leads 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.819
 not only that the disease 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.560
 Maybe it could happen 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.970
 also be that new by this mistake 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.069
 we develop diseases 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 so far not knowing but good 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.099
 to be fair you have to say that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.660
 we are still at the beginning and 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.430
 Of course, little is known yet 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.989
 and how is the story often shown 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 It is only a matter of time before 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.629
 we also have this science someday 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.550
 to understand better 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.260
 and that's why it's incredible 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.790
 important to us as a society like that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.069
 early as possible with the ethical 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.180
 we should deal with it 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.680
 really changing our own genes 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.060
 I mean even when we are safe 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.989
 can not do that after several 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.120
 Generations still have problems 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.540
 We really want to perform in one 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.790
 living in the world where everyone is perfect is clear 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.230
 is it fairer to have proven 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.159
 it attractive person always easier 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.019
 to get a job 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.849
 but is it still human if everyone 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.819
 Type on the road is a great guy 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.170
 a world full of winners the potential 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.150
 this method is of course huge 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.739
 diseases even before the birth of one 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.030
 exclude people and thus 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.799
 maybe many lives save and 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 with the decades of research and 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.469
 Maybe we can experiment 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.750
 even be sure that we have nothing 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.829
 other important break but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.879
 we can really do that at the 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.379
 stop illnesses 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.489
 how long will it take to get one 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.799
 rogue his own 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.480
 Super Soldiers together mixed or celebrities 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.620
 your children already a bit prematurely 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.569
 jazz up 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.980
 in many respects you can see ours 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.870
 current situation with the sheep dolly 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.829
 compare the first cloned 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.299
 mammal 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.650
 I think we will be in the next 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.090
 Years still much on this topic 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.620
 speak and I'm extremely curious what 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 Your opinion on the subject is written 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.250
 In any case, below in the comments 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.930
 and worth mentioning I still that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.939
 the trade magazine science that we here 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.709
 at pixum very often and very much 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.449
 cite for ethical reasons 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.030
 The study has refused to 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.260
 if you still have it from me 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.549
 want a birthday present then 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.720
 click on the first link below in the 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.000
 video description there you click 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 free audiobook by audible complete 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.659
 free no hidden costs 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.129
 and otherwise have fun with it and if 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.569
 you want to see more of me then 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.760
 you can find the last two down here 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.870
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.870
 and I'm going to celebrate
