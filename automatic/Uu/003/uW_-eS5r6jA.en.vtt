sea<00:04:55.300> towing<00:04:55.510> puts<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.960> greater<00:04:56.200> load<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.620> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
sea towing puts a greater load on the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.440 
sea towing puts a greater load on the
transmission<00:04:57.250> fluid<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.970> means<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.300> more

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
transmission fluid that means it's more

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.180 
transmission fluid that means it's more
likely<00:04:58.900> you'll<00:04:59.080> need<00:04:59.230> to<00:04:59.320> change<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.800> fluid

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
likely you'll need to change that fluid

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.220 
likely you'll need to change that fluid
more<00:05:00.340> often<00:05:00.730> so<00:05:01.510> if<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.660> transmission<00:05:02.110> fluid

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
more often so if the transmission fluid

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.390 
more often so if the transmission fluid
starts<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.800> look<00:05:02.950> dirty

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
starts to look dirty

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.250 
starts to look dirty
we'll<00:05:03.640> want<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.820> keep<00:05:03.940> an<00:05:04.060> eye<00:05:04.210> on<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.540> if<00:05:05.080> we

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
we'll want to keep an eye on that if we

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.080 
we'll want to keep an eye on that if we
find<00:05:05.530> metal<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.070> fluid<00:05:06.400> that<00:05:06.790> could

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
find metal in the fluid that could

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.540 
find metal in the fluid that could
indicate<00:05:07.450> bearing<00:05:08.110> failure<00:05:08.650> or<00:05:08.890> broken<00:05:09.340> gear
