thinking of the restricted trade area

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.100 
thinking of the restricted trade area
with<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> grin<00:01:26.700> exchange<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.689> public

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the only reason why this worked in the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.770 
the only reason why this worked in the
restrictor<00:01:44.700> trade<00:01:44.939> days<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.630> there

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
restrictor trade days is because there

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
restrictor trade days is because there
