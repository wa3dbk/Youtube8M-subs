this<00:00:10.360> is<00:00:10.510> just<00:00:10.719> a<00:00:10.870> video<00:00:11.080> of<00:00:11.910> starting<00:00:12.910> off<00:00:13.090> my

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
this is just a video of starting off my

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.510 
this is just a video of starting off my
4<00:00:13.870> horsepower<00:00:14.199> to<00:00:14.650> come<00:00:14.920> see<00:00:15.100> you<00:00:15.279> at<00:00:15.400> my

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
4 horsepower to come see you at my

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.599 
4 horsepower to come see you at my
grandpa<00:00:15.969> gave<00:00:16.150> me<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:17.100> tuning<00:00:18.100> it<00:00:18.220> because<00:00:18.490> I

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
grandpa gave me and tuning it because I

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.240 
grandpa gave me and tuning it because I
just<00:00:18.820> clean<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.539> carburetor<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.980> I'm<00:00:21.070> going

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
just clean the carburetor so I'm going

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.359 
just clean the carburetor so I'm going
to<00:00:21.310> adjust<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.910> just<00:00:25.890> doing<00:00:26.890> some<00:00:27.099> checks

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
to adjust it just doing some checks

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.350 
to adjust it just doing some checks
here's<00:00:27.789> my<00:00:28.089> spark<00:00:28.509> plug<00:00:28.810> seen<00:00:29.079> to<00:00:29.259> that<00:00:29.289> spark

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.650 

that's<00:00:34.360> good<00:00:35.760> ok<00:00:36.760> I'm<00:00:36.910> going<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.120> do<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.360> start

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
that's good ok I'm going to do is start

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.720 
that's good ok I'm going to do is start
here<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.989> just<00:00:38.289> cranked<00:00:38.649> it<00:00:38.710> summon<00:00:39.129> it<00:00:39.250> started

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
here I just cranked it summon it started

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.389 
here I just cranked it summon it started
for<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.969> little<00:00:40.210> bit<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.320> had<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.649> going<00:00:41.980> the

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
for a little bit and I had it going the

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.110 
for a little bit and I had it going the
smoke<00:00:42.699> coming<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.750> exhaust<00:00:44.079> is<00:00:44.410> really<00:00:44.769> blue

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
smoke coming the exhaust is really blue

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.580 
smoke coming the exhaust is really blue
it<00:00:46.120> looks<00:00:46.180> like<00:00:46.629> it's<00:00:46.809> burning<00:00:47.019> oil<00:00:47.230> but<00:00:47.500> it

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
it looks like it's burning oil but it

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.410 
it looks like it's burning oil but it
actually<00:00:47.800> isn't<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.430> rings<00:00:48.609> are<00:00:48.820> good<00:00:48.850> on<00:00:49.269> it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
actually isn't the rings are good on it

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually isn't the rings are good on it
it's<00:00:50.289> doing<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.980> because<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.750> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's doing that because there's a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.799 
it's doing that because there's a
cleaner<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:54.789> used<00:00:55.120> when<00:00:55.300> I<00:00:55.420> was<00:00:55.539> cleaning

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
cleaner that I used when I was cleaning

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.650 
cleaner that I used when I was cleaning
the<00:00:56.399> valves<00:00:57.399> out<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.879> exhaust<00:00:58.300> at<00:00:58.570> the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
the valves out and the exhaust at the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.299 
the valves out and the exhaust at the
moment<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.050> it<00:00:59.140> has<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.379> get<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.679> burnt<00:01:00.039> out

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
moment so it has to get that burnt out

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.540 
moment so it has to get that burnt out
so<00:01:00.640> that's<00:01:01.629> leaving<00:01:01.960> some<00:01:02.679> blue<00:01:02.949> smoke<00:01:03.280> come

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
so that's leaving some blue smoke come

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:43.780 
so that's leaving some blue smoke come
out<00:01:05.370> okay<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.799> loud

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.600 

that's<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:45.030> happened<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.480> for<00:01:45.900> just

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
that's what happened there for just

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.500 
that's what happened there for just
started<00:01:47.610> running<00:01:47.700> too<00:01:47.940> fast<00:01:48.150> can't<00:01:48.390> get

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
started running too fast can't get

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.670 
started running too fast can't get
enough<00:01:48.750> fuel<00:01:48.960> though<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.620> choke<00:01:50.070> still<00:01:50.490> on

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
enough fuel though I the choke still on

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.340 
enough fuel though I the choke still on
well<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.860> figured<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.370> my<00:01:53.490> problem<00:01:54.350> once

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
well I just figured out my problem once

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.700 
well I just figured out my problem once
I<00:01:55.620> clean<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> spark<00:01:56.370> plug<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> put<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I clean the spark plug and put it in and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
I clean the spark plug and put it in and
run<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.580> runs<00:01:59.820> fine<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.810> while

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
run it it runs fine for a little while

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.870 
run it it runs fine for a little while
and<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.470> stalls<00:02:01.950> there<00:02:02.280> backfires

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and then it stalls there backfires

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.410 
and then it stalls there backfires
sometimes<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.200> kills<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:06.090> because

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
sometimes and just kills it's because

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.480 
sometimes and just kills it's because
the<00:02:06.630> spark<00:02:06.960> plug<00:02:07.230> it<00:02:07.500> once<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.800> gets<00:02:08.040> heated<00:02:08.280> up

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
the spark plug it once it gets heated up

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.340 
the spark plug it once it gets heated up
it<00:02:08.700> starts<00:02:09.000> following<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.690> works<00:02:09.869> real<00:02:10.110> good

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
it starts following it works real good

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.290 
it starts following it works real good
one<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.710> cold<00:02:11.040> like<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.460> showed<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.970> spark

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
one it's cold like I showed the spark

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.920 
one it's cold like I showed the spark
before<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.730> runs<00:02:15.030> okay<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
before so it runs okay for a little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.920 
before so it runs okay for a little
while<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:17.070> need<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.580> get<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> new<00:02:17.910> spark<00:02:18.270> plug<00:02:18.600> for

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
while I need to get a new spark plug for

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.580 
while I need to get a new spark plug for
it<00:02:18.960> first<00:02:20.420> before<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:21.930> anything<00:02:21.960> more

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
it first before I can do anything more

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.670 
it first before I can do anything more
so<00:02:23.300> they'll<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.450> updates<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.380> again

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so they'll be updates on this again

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.810 
so they'll be updates on this again
later<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.010> you've<00:02:29.160> never<00:02:29.340> seen<00:02:29.640> one

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
later and if you've never seen one

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.060 
later and if you've never seen one
before<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.900> come<00:02:31.140> ski<00:02:31.470> starter

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
before this is a to come ski starter

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.010 
before this is a to come ski starter
they<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.180> keys<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.720> come<00:02:33.900> out

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
they have the little keys that come out

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.730 
they have the little keys that come out
when<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.320> pull<00:02:36.050> sometimes<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> Ofcom's<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
when you pull sometimes the Ofcom's that

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.400 
when you pull sometimes the Ofcom's that
those<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.130> engage<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.290> be

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
those don't engage right and that can be

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.780 
those don't engage right and that can be
a<00:02:40.440> problem<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.130> starter<00:02:41.640> isn't

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
a problem with your starter isn't

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.720 
a problem with your starter isn't
working<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:49.100> there's<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.400> another

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
working on this and there's just another

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.020 
working on this and there's just another
view<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.270> engine<00:02:55.340> has<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.370> original<00:02:56.730> tag

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
view of the engine has the original tag

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.729 
view of the engine has the original tag
on<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> saw<00:02:59.750> each<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:01.820> h40<00:03:02.820> model<00:03:03.739> it's

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
on it it saw each time h40 model it's

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.570 
on it it saw each time h40 model it's
got<00:03:04.920> four<00:03:05.250> horsepower<00:03:08.780> nice<00:03:09.780> engine<00:03:10.580> my

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
got four horsepower nice engine my

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.870 
got four horsepower nice engine my
grandpa<00:03:12.060> had<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.600> was<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> tiller<00:03:13.880> he

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
grandpa had it it was on a tiller he
