00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.560
 Y 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.949
 and you, if not, that 's a very good one 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.199
 very good rachita like 76 deaths and I am 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.879
 me and if I alone my team do not know where 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.230
 I was doing as you saw then I decided 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.150
 get them in the back because 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 on this map it is normal that in that part 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.360
 where I killed them are changing 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.760
 waiting for you to get through the part of 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.100
 opposite usually throw a grenade 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.589
 they throw confusion they throw everything until their 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.239
 sister lamenting agile but this time not 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.920
 subway real picture his sister got the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.080
 specialist and with a drop shawn johnson 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.890
 scott I do not know how much I did but what 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.149
 I got 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.429
 matthew is nobody to have launched a 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.840
 conclusion and I say good what can I do 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.340
 there's 12 radar shows us that there are two 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.229
 but hey there's one more there I'm going to 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.479
 kill to see if I can see if I can 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.800
 I escaped I was lucky there was 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.509
 launched another conclusion and I say there's no 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.160
 continue so I could not move because 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.530
 although the radar you in one of my team 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.179
 to the other side and had like three 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.950
 enemies there then I told me the game 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.509
 I do not play very tight ball and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.399
 so much because not a little bit of 10 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.229
 scales incarnate throw me everything 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.060
 but good enough to kill is the same you know 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.070
 that unless here why 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.649
 it's a lot of movement in one 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 area what are you seeing today 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.340
 it's a gameplay that usually are 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.789
 gameplays that normally do not usually go up 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.920
 to the channel because let's say three embargo 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.500
 They know that all I do is treat 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.330
 to take out no apps I do not like to play with 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.240
 gusting spells or any other type of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.549
 thing because the brand does not cause me that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.439
 nerve in your nerves at the time of 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.110
 Let me say I need a low I need 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.899
 two and feel nerve even though in 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.659
 the playstation or greg take out more than one hundred 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.729
 hundred and many more always follows me 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.100
 happening the same thing I get nervous almost 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.130
 in the end something that happens to me also in 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.170
 goes when I try to get a here something 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.790
 that does not happen to me in black ops 2 because 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.769
 let's say blackout 2 when you go by 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.080
 a nuclear one is something a little bit easier 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.170
 because if you play with friends they help you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.650
 with nine against nine they help you when 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.390
 orbits here it was very common for them to be a 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.489
 father and they helped you with vests you 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.680
 they helped with re control but as 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.120
 you always know normally me 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 most of the time in the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.680
 playstation 3 in morÃ³n f3 played alone 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.689
 here I was when just also a little 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.420
 of team duel because good me 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.969
 I got tired of the streams coming I tried 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.769
 of taking one more one I sell my nation in 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.560
 low confirmed and can not then said 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.180
 Well, let's play aimlessly, no 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.519
 let's go to a little bit of mourning for 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.049
 teams was very well-rounded because no 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.370
 it was counted was this good I know what was 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.859
 doing so I told him borrow for the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.750
 orchestra because nothing costs you and in this 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.280
 part was already like a little 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.620
 nervous because he knew he was close 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.239
 I do not know how many but there was something 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.359
 he said he was close I was seeing 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.819
 the marker because sometimes I'm 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.519
 shooting like that shooting is coming up and 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.260
 he killed him who spotted a radar of his 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.930
 you damage iguana radar because there 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.030
 one see where he was changing good 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.109
 rachita as of 22 I see one of 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.359
 government 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.329
 diamond the decline is mine I do not say is 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.010
 mavis mine is yours grabbed the same afternoon 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.969
 it kills are just going where it is 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.969
 changing in there 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.230
 equal to campero with type 25 95 one of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.440
 the weapons that marched like three or 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.270
 four times for today to lower them the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.890
 power but it was always running 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.780
 like the truth I do not know what they will have 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.270
 done or chose anything I believe but 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.950
 because that's where I lost my streak as 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.870
 I could have taken it out if it had not been 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.160
 for that countryman on the top in 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.140
 the boiler where they always put 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.020
 change is nobody because everything in good 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 memories there were many tuberosa and 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.350
 thank god that has blow but what 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.360
 only you find are snipers webs 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.830
 with a light weapon trying to be 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.470
 will expose even though it's not where 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.209
 they want to make you expose but 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.590
 good the software that I had at the time of 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.489
 trying to get a gang out is a 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.889
 sympathetic gameplay 38 downs 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.050
 although I managed to simply get with 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.569
 my weapon the pp 90 very similar at the same time 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.849
 online in which a double sack of 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.620
 triple to stable the way changing your 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.520
 time champion in places that you say no 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.080
 I know neither how that fake and then who was 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.550
 the one who shot him I was 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.410
 shooting someone disappeared from 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.789
 Suddenly they kill me and we go the marker 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.039
 how they manage to see gang for five 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.720
 thousand five thousand 600 points to 2000 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.180
 we were completely dominating the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.039
 game were five minutes with 15 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.930
 second throw a conclusion because I know 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.630
 that are there already radar division launched the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.979
 another conclusion and here they see that 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.900
 it is by law that you have to put them on 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.300
 like fog co2 that you could take them off 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.099
 to put something else I take with me what 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.789
 that is deadly silence very effective 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.560
 here although although usually people 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.150
 when when you see many people 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.979
 mortal contingency as it is put in 7 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.780
 to try to listen to that kind of 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.280
 people and then if I could be a little 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.180
 talking about the example that is also the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.130
 background 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.300
 and these are what it employs of time since 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.430
 those times when I was 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.139
 when I threw myself in 6 36 hours 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.880
 it's not a gameplay that day but 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.220
 let's say from a day before a day 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.650
 then they are gameplays that as I say 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.180
 I have saved there is this one already in 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.070
 full lady if you are going to occupy what was the 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.600
 first part to try to do 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.430
 let's say as an assembly type 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.770
 specialist but like right now I'm not 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.389
 playing and I do not have a captor 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.039
 I repeat again to be able to get more 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.560
 what a good politician the officials at 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.180
 final against gameplay there is johnson water 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.990
 I say English has fired that plane or 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.340
 changing more in the pots but good 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.110
 that was all for my pretensions 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.610
 big and it was already you can deny him 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.560
 online do not forget to start with me 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.360
 page on facebook for my page on 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.009
 harley twitter in this video if it is 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.889
 that they liked and they go to this last low 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.770
 who nice I say goodbye and says a lot 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.770
 of emotion in the next to the virus
