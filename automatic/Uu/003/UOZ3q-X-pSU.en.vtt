00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.970
 let's prepare pionono rainbow 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 the ingredients are a Genoese sponge cake 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.740
 dyes in gel and for filling 200 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.200
 grams of cream or whipping cream 100 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.930
 grams of cream cheese and between 50 and 100 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.330
 grams of sugar to taste 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.730
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.380
 prepare the mass of the Genoese biscuit os 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.350
 I leave the video link of the cake 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.420
 Genoese in the description of this video 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.440
 Once the dough is prepared, we divide it 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.440
 in 6 parts 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 We have each of the parts of a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.309
 different color 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.309
 I use red 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 orange 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 yellow 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 green 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 blue 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.310
 and purple 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 pour each of the colors in one 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 pastry bag 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.210
 and now on the oven tray we're going 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 making lines alternating colors 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.330
 well to finish with all the mass and what 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.150
 we bake at 180 degrees for 12 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.700
 minutes 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.439
 just take it out of the oven we put 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.439
 over another oven paper 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.800
 we turn it around 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.110
 and we take off the paper in which 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.110
 we had baked 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.870
 we put it on a damp cloth 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.870
 we roll it with the included paper 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 and we roll it in the wet cloth what 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.230
 we let cool like this 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.050
 while we prepare the filling we assemble 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.700
 cream 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.700
 we add the sugar 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.599
 the cream cheese 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.090
 and we ride until it thickens 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.410
 since we roll the cake 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.170
 we add the filling 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.290
 We perform 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.890
 and we roll it up helping with the paper 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.690
 I have filled it in a lot so 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.310
 it costs a little more to roll it up if 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.310
 stuffed less or it will be easier 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.319
 and ready can already taste our 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.759
 pionono arcoiris that I can assure you 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.759
 that is delicious
