00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.090
 the series starts from the idea that the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.290
 human evolution would remain active 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.440

 among the super heroic characters of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 the comics because they have acquired 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 superpowers in a natural way due to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.740
 changes in your genetic structure the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 main theme in their stories is the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.679
 persecution of the so-called dream of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.200
 Javier integrating the mutants into 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.470

 mutants of human fear 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.100
 In contrast, other groups of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.920
 mutants would seek rebellion 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.650

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.010
 is given to the introduction of characters 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.680
