00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.366
The old man when he was born.

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.899
The old man when he got a wife.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.432
The old man when he rises to heaven.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.431
These will be moved according to the music.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.330
This clock will be used as a governor.

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:16.363
The gears accelerate the spring.

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:19.429
The escape wheel,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:21.462
the pallet,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:23.428
and the pendulum.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.461
As the pendulum goes back and forth, the wheel turns a little.

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.760
The wheel pushes the pallet, and the pendulum keeps swinging.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.892
The minute hand and hour hand. 　The clock will control the following movements:

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.958
In the first verse, the old man is born;

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.957
In the second, he is married to a beautiful bride; and

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:42.857
In the third, he rises to heaven.

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:45.289
This is the switch.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:51.288
When OFF , it does not move.

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:52.454
ON

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:54.587
When ON, it moves.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.353
Three switches control ON/OFFs of the three movements.

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.353
Link the three switches.

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:02.252
Supply power to each switch.

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:08.051
Only the one with the switch turned on, it moves.

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:11.150
Turn ON the top only.

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:17.115
Turn ON the switches one by one.

00:01:18.148 --> 00:01:19.981
Turn ON the top only.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:27.113
Turn ON one switch while turning OFF the previous one.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.845
Add dummy switches on the top and bottom.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:37.177
The top switch is coupled with the bottom dummy switch.

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:42.110
The bottom switch is coupled with the top dummy switch.

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:45.809
Turning ON/OFF the switches will be repeated.

00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:55.040
Power of the clock is branched to the left and right.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.106
Move the minute hand and hour hand to the right.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.038
Connect the switches to the left.

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.138
Extend the output of the switches to the side.

00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:08.003
Connect the baby (to be the old man).

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:11.136
Connect the beautiful bride.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.735
Connect the old man to rise to heaven.

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.868
It will be like this. (in 10x speed)

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.001
Born.

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:22.900
Married.

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.366
Departs.

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.865
The second round...
Soon the spring will be off.

00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:34.697
Play sound with the official MSX emulator (which came with the collector's edition). 

00:02:34.797 --> 00:02:41.796
The code using "cdefgab" will play "CDEFGAB."

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:47.261
Specify the sound length at the end of the characters. A minim.

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:51.527
Hemidemisemiquaver.

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:56.725
Specifying an octave with "O4"、"O5"

00:02:56.825 --> 00:03:01.858
will play notes from a C to the next higher C.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:11.389
"r" is for rest, followed by the duration.

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:17.087
T specifies the tempo.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.319
I inputted the song, "My Grandfather's Clock."

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:28.551
This program will play the song through the third.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.284
The Japanese version of the verse seems to be

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.750
protected by the author's copyright.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.349
Watch it while you remember the verse.

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:44.781
In the first verse, the old man is born.

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:56.911
"The clock was bought on the morning of the day Grandfather was born.,"

00:03:58.244 --> 00:04:02.243
The song is divided to arrays to be played using a FOR loop.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.509
In addition, it will be a double loop since the verses from the first to the third will be played. 

00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:12.874
In the second verse, a beautiful bride appears.

00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:23.772
"The beautiful bride arrived."

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:36.935
The parts are delicately angled.

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.968
They form a right triangle with ３：４：５ lengths.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:42.901
It was used to lock the spring.

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:55.831
In the third verse, he rises to heaven.

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:59.030
４０：９：４１ This will 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.230
fix A at 40.

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:04.862
B and C were integer solutions between 0～99 which 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.128
I found using Pythagorean theorem. 

00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:16.893
"Grandfather went to heaven."
