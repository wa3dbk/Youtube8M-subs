00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 It is really good but we have preferred 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.710
 use this period this week of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.850
 the next two to recover everything 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.670
 totally to put it in a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.110
 terms 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 optimal for 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.020
 prepare the parties regarding the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 review 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.910
 the champions league match for this 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.700
 more tomorrow he will not talk is out of 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 the call 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.870
 the market will be done on Monday something can 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 happen as something can not happen I think that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.810
 the template we do not have many players 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.540
 but the template is a part 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.990
 polyvalent we have all the covered 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.990
 sites 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.079
 until the sierra market we can not 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.480
 say if we are going to sign or if we are not going to 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.899
 to sign has explained it very well that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.680
 I needed one kind or another of showed 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.619
 last option we have we have all the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.180
 materialistic world has much respect 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.870
 by this player for this person 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 then it was very difficult d 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.940
 that changed this idea and we have left it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 leave because I think that 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.140
 what he has done here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.010
 with the attitude that has had as 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010
 player as a person 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.630
 It was very difficult d 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 to tell you not you can not go out I think 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.320
 what alonso 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.910
 he has been a player 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.930
 very very important last year for 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.930
 win titles 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.300
 in this sense we also have this 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.850
 position very well covered because 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.190
 we have the tonic those who are being 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.470
 very well in this position and there are also 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.280
 now mind and it can be done 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.180
 very useful in this season 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.110
 clear that he went to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.950
 a surprise to this because everything was 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.380
 quiet after the decided and in another 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 way it can be that any one can think 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.440
 that the template is a bit short but 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 we have as I said a very player 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.690
 polyvalent we practically have 5 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.670
 forward because we have the possibility 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.580
 to use disks as front of 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.850
 use james as forward soon 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.200
 will make the incorporation of hesse but that 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.579
 we are going to face it well we have 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.329
 motivation we have to keep winning 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.329
 this cousin party 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.380
 away from home we know that they have inhabited 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.080
 always still a very difficult field the year 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.380
 we have done very well 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:06.680
 the desire to continue winning improving 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.370
 the performance in the field comparing it to 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 Sunday thing that a player does not like 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.740
 the competition can be that a player 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.340
 wants to earn more money then when 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.850
 a player wants to go out I'm 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.600
 do not 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.130
 than to let it out because that one 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.850
 player does not have the motivation to be 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 or stay in a larger team 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.730
 of the world I think he has no problems 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.970
 stop it from letting it out but every 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 situation is very very different 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.600
 can be this is available for 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.780
 play as I was giving 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.640
 are the others we have only the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.200
 unavailability of has contracted that has 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.270
 had in is guix in the match of 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.970
 supercopa athletic control in a 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.250
 has still fully recovered go to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.170
 to be worried we have to need 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.810
 as always time like the new one without 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.230
 need last year this this 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.960
 team 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.090
 I think he deserved the year for 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.780
 what he has done last year a vote of 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.359
 trust 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.790
 in this week I have not seen it I have not 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.510
 seen I have a very template 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:27.040
 competitive and as I said incorporating 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.960
 three players with excellent quality 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.080
 fantastic I think the template 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.260
 improved comparing it to last year 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:42.160
 we have a need 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.260
 not if we think what 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.870
 a signing can be good to improve 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.180
 the template we do if we do not 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.930
 the template is very competitive I think 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.590
 that we have the time 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.530
 to think about preparing this game we 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.630
 like to go to bulgaria because bulgaria 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.169
 has a very good story 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.259
 football then we're going to 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.130
 prepare the best trying as 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.130
 always to win it
