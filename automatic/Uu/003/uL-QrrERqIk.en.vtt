00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
around 12 times and make it should make

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.010

sure that you feel fatigue around that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
sure that you feel fatigue around that
12th<00:00:49.410> repetition<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
12th repetition you can probably do a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.750 
12th repetition you can probably do a
few<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> stopped<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.350> 12<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
few more but you stopped on 12 so the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
few more but you stopped on 12 so the
push-up<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.449> option<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> knee<00:00:58.739> push

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
push-up the first option is a knee push

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.939 
push-up the first option is a knee push
up<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.760> you're<00:00:59.879> doing<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> knee<00:01:00.420> push<00:01:00.690> up

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
up so when you're doing a knee push up

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
up so when you're doing a knee push up
in<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.190> push<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.640> hands<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.120> wide

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
in any push up your hands are wide

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
in any push up your hands are wide
enough<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:04.860> position<00:01:04.890> your

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
enough so that in the down position your

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
enough so that in the down position your

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
elbows are right angled like so in the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
elbows are right angled like so in the
case<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.890> knee<00:01:11.010> push<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> nice

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
case of the knee push up you want a nice
straight<00:01:12.510> line<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> knees<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.830> head

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
straight line from the knees to the head

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
straight line from the knees to the head
