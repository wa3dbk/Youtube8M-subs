and solid model in paper space the first
thing<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.130> erase<00:00:08.790> both<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.540> large

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.330 

and<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:32.240> with<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.600> AutoCAD<00:04:33.199> you<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.830> command

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
and then with the AutoCAD you in command

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.790 
and then with the AutoCAD you in command
I'll<00:04:34.639> join<00:04:35.419> them<00:04:35.690> both<00:04:35.930> parts<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:37.009> create<00:04:37.220> one

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
I'll join them both parts to create one

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.730 
I'll join them both parts to create one
and<00:04:40.840> using<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.050> visual<00:04:42.259> Styles<00:04:43.220> button<00:04:43.970> add

and using the visual Styles button add

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.040 
and using the visual Styles button add
little<00:04:45.740> shading<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.520> drawing

little shading to the drawing

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.820 
little shading to the drawing
and<00:04:48.610> now<00:04:49.610> I'll<00:04:49.970> change<00:04:50.569> back<00:04:50.900> into<00:04:50.930> one<00:04:51.560> view

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
and now I'll change back into one view

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.810 
and now I'll change back into one view
to<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:52.550> what<00:04:52.759> we<00:04:52.940> have<00:04:53.090> accomplished

to see what we have accomplished

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.190 
to see what we have accomplished
and<00:04:55.890> then<00:04:56.890> I<00:04:56.920> moved<00:04:57.340> into<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.000> top<00:04:58.450> or<00:04:58.720> plan

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
and then I moved into the top or plan

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.770 
and then I moved into the top or plan
view<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.280> we<00:05:00.640> could<00:05:00.820> see<00:05:01.120> both

everything<00:05:02.740> together

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010
