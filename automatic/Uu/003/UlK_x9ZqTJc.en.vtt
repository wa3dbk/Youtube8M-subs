play<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> course<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.730> abnormal<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.690> have

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
play of course I have abnormal I have

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
play of course I have abnormal I have
defined<00:01:01.710> history<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> reason<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.030> i'm

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
defined history and the reason that i'm

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
defined history and the reason that i'm
kinda<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.530> include<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> because

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
kinda if you do include them is because

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
kinda if you do include them is because
they<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.330> original<00:01:06.720> member

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
they only have one original member

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
they only have one original member
involves<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:08.670> left<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.330> at

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
involves the other three left or at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
involves the other three left or at
least<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:10.170> left<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.650> i'm<00:01:10.740> pretty<00:01:10.890> sure<00:01:11.070> all

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
least two left but i'm pretty sure all

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
least two left but i'm pretty sure all
three<00:01:11.369> left<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.150> pretty<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> brand

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
three left so it's pretty much a brand

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
three left so it's pretty much a brand
new<00:01:13.229> team<00:01:13.470> anything<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.100> happen<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> next
