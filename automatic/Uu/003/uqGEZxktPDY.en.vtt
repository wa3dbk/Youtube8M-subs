down there trying to figure out those

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.269 
down there trying to figure out those
games<00:00:14.870> when<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.170> discovered<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> iphone

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
games when I first discovered the iphone

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.609 
games when I first discovered the iphone
sdk<00:00:17.580> i<00:00:18.240> saw<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> huge<00:00:19.380> opportunity

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
sdk i saw that it was a huge opportunity

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.650 
sdk i saw that it was a huge opportunity
I<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.520> when<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> game<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.570> my

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I was like when I can do a game of my

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
I was like when I can do a game of my
own<00:00:21.689> terms<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.859> excited<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.340> about<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
own terms what excited me about the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
own terms what excited me about the
platform<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> fact<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.960> an

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
platform was just the fact that was an

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
platform was just the fact that was an
all<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.410> end<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> tool<00:00:26.310> chain<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.180> new

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
all on one end and tool chain and I new

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.500 
all on one end and tool chain and I new
iphone<00:00:27.810> provided<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> fundamentally<00:00:29.429> new<00:00:29.640> type

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
iphone provided a fundamentally new type

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.840 
iphone provided a fundamentally new type
of<00:00:30.539> gaming<00:00:30.869> experience<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.099> myself<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
of gaming experience and as myself for a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.120 
of gaming experience and as myself for a
game<00:00:33.059> based<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.570> touching<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> tilting

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
game based on touching and tilting

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
game based on touching and tilting
what's<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> natural<00:00:36.030> evolution<00:00:36.210> point<00:00:36.630> for

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
what's a natural evolution point for

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
what's a natural evolution point for
that<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.500> game<00:00:37.680> would<00:00:37.860> would<00:00:38.040> fit

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that what kind of game would would fit

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.200 
that what kind of game would would fit
best<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.090> there

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
best in there

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.450 
best in there
when<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:40.870> starting<00:00:41.260> my<00:00:41.320> ideas<00:00:41.559> for<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.739> game<00:00:41.920> at

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
when I starting my ideas for the game at

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.490 
when I starting my ideas for the game at
first<00:00:42.670> I<00:00:42.820> wanted<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.149> have<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.329> web<00:00:43.809> of<00:00:44.110> some

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
first I wanted to have a web of some

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.860 
first I wanted to have a web of some
kinda<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:44.980> wanted<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.250> pinch<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.850> web<00:00:46.270> points

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
kinda you wanted to pinch the web points

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.930 
kinda you wanted to pinch the web points
in<00:00:47.050> each<00:00:47.079> other<00:00:47.350> after<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.460> was<00:00:48.610> like<00:00:48.670> well

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
in each other after that I was like well

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.400 
in each other after that I was like well
I<00:00:48.970> guess<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.269> gonna<00:00:49.390> have<00:00:49.510> like<00:00:49.629> a<00:00:49.720> lattice<00:00:50.199> of

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
I guess I gonna have like a lattice of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.979 
I guess I gonna have like a lattice of
intertwined<00:00:51.250> shapes<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.300> I'm<00:00:52.360> like<00:00:52.540> how

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
intertwined shapes and I'm like how

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.350 
intertwined shapes and I'm like how
about<00:00:53.140> I<00:00:53.170> make<00:00:53.379> these<00:00:53.530> things<00:00:53.590> blocks<00:00:54.160> then<00:00:54.879> my

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
about I make these things blocks then my

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.930 
about I make these things blocks then my
buddy<00:00:55.570> Rob<00:00:55.809> came<00:00:56.110> over<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.620> we<00:00:57.309> cut<00:00:57.579> up<00:00:57.699> my

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
buddy Rob came over and we cut up my

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.810 
buddy Rob came over and we cut up my
phone<00:00:58.210> bill<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.629> had<00:00:59.290> 500<00:00:59.949> triangles<00:01:00.430> he<00:01:00.610> said

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
phone bill and had 500 triangles he said

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.210 
phone bill and had 500 triangles he said
okay<00:01:01.059> what<00:01:01.420> we<00:01:01.720> fit<00:01:01.989> in<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.290> screen<00:01:02.379> there's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
okay what we fit in the screen there's

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.920 
okay what we fit in the screen there's
the<00:01:03.370> one<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.790> couch<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:04.119> somewhere<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.629> them

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
the one that couch is somewhere on them

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.730 
the one that couch is somewhere on them
I<00:01:05.729> did<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.850> game<00:01:07.060> forum<00:01:07.390> idea<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.899> demo<00:01:08.110> in<00:01:08.350> 10

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
I did the game forum idea to demo in 10

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.999 
I did the game forum idea to demo in 10
days<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:09.250> would<00:01:09.970> go<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.119> work<00:01:10.390> get<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.290> with<00:01:11.440> 5pm

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
days I would go to work get on with 5pm

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.700 
days I would go to work get on with 5pm
code<00:01:12.729> until<00:01:12.910> 5am<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.960> then<00:01:14.229> go<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.410> work<00:01:14.649> at

just<00:01:31.720> have<00:01:31.929> fun<00:01:31.960> with<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:33.250> UI<00:01:33.399> kit<00:01:33.550> that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
just have fun with it the UI kit that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.580 
just have fun with it the UI kit that
make<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:34.450> easy<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:35.020> make<00:01:35.050> animations

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
make it so easy to make animations

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.700 
make it so easy to make animations
happen<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.070> had<00:01:37.030> three<00:01:37.270> screw<00:01:38.020> head<00:01:38.200> objects

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
happen I had three screw head objects

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.680 
happen I had three screw head objects
and<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:39.250> able<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.460> rotate<00:01:39.789> those<00:01:40.119> screws<00:01:40.479> is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
and be able to rotate those screws is

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.210 
and be able to rotate those screws is
probably<00:01:41.289> not<00:01:41.409> something<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.800> would<00:01:41.950> have<00:01:42.039> done

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
probably not something I would have done

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580 
probably not something I would have done
