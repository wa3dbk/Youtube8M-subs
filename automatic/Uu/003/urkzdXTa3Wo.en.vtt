00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.100
 but first I want to approve the sports bet always bet 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 since man is man, the one from whom he was going to hunt the first dinosaur 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.119
 pm 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.379
 but nowadays 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.379
 world because the pose by quito is part of everyday life 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.499
 although paul is not like that in Spain but there are signs of which state Montesinos 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.789
 but I wonder 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 while the sports bet 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.710
 think about a sport it does not matter which one does not matter if you do not know anything about it that does not 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.870
 have never practiced before even equality that does not know or pronounce the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.460
 sure sport feet that in some corner of the internet can bet on 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630
 it makes three disks more time the recipients 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.780
 myriam guillén bolos 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 for five years the well-ordered sports betting now the arrears 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 is cybernetics you can bet for two 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170
 but mostly because 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 who thinks the first scorer of a sevilla-valencia closer 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 Of course 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.810
 markey sent 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.190
 how many faults there will be in a match 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.760
 one to three 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.310
 mark there I will be free direct will trace that starts losing 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.170
 fifteen minutes the first change will occur 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 how many balls in the wood will there be penalties goals 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.550
 how many goals will there be 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.470
 how many yellow cards in the first part 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 and in the second 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.240
 but if you decide risk 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.939
 you can talk bet because the first goal of the Olympique de Lyon will be scored by 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.939
 central defense crisis 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.900
 although you can also earn money 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.230
 not bet why go to prison for burning the king's photo is paid 14 to 1 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.790
 but if you want to become a millionaire you bet to end up being part of the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.330
 Popular party for each euro that bets will do 350 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.730
 always ahead but careful in Spain that could be contributed to know 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.210
 what would be the sex of the first son of the princes of asturias after 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 We all do nothing much because the art museum sub-station 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.830
 modern of Bogota with this proposal the thing is simple any party 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.280
 for example with chelsea valencia we bet that in the rest the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 Spanish team will win 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.469
 8 we spend 20 euros 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.009
 if that happens we would stop 2020 so much better only five euros 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.959
 the corridors of the four to rest we gain 550 after the opinion bet 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.909
 you get to a place like this 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.320
 a kind of tower of babel 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.320
 where you can listen to over 20 languages ​​in one afternoon 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.449
 they are right 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.449
 that is, the worst things 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.329
 this is doing it ppt 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 pepa said 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.219
 Juan Barrachina and Pablo Asensio 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.880
 South of Europe is becoming comfortable in him 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.269
 great golden sports betting to Spain from a great culture game 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.860
 I think it's the country in the world that more money is spent 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.410
 the people did not have a great Sunday culture from here to little more than two 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.889
 years, people will be betting 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.340
 as something as natural as the lottery teens feel Spain is 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.970
 spectacular only in growth 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.259
 over one hundred percent per year 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.879
 a business that doubles its benefits every year 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.749
 it's time for the figures 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.529
 in 2005 only 40 thousand people bet on the internet 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.530
 in 2008 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.739
 200 thousand are expected 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.129
 let's talk about cinema 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.150
 in 2005 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.400
 internet and the game moved about 255 million euros 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.350
 in 2007 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.350
 the sum was 650 million 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.589
 cup consolation and its Olympic games are estimated one thousand 200 million euros 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:52.480
 in three years 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 has quintupled 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.370
 there is more to see the shirt of Real Madrid 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.819
 it seems that the thing of the bookmakers give 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.020
 in last season 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.520
 al madrid sponsored a siemens subsidiary the company broke the team 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.669
 white put a sponsor knot 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.789
 the madrid won the league still with the shirt of siemens 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.079
 the players went to the locker room and when they left to continue the party 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.739
 new shirt 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.049
 with the new sponsor 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.259
 it ended unexpected 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
 minute to associate 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.180
 in short is an Austrian company one of its headquarters this company 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.220
 lewin has a million and a half clients that adjust weekly 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.570
 on average weekend they withdraw an average of 3 4 million bets only 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.430
 they consumed it 'at all the bookmakers even though he was only a witness in 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.990
 euros the result is dizzying how much the world's online sport moves 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.360
 30 billion 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.210
 of dollars that is what drives the online game 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.600
 this still light years of what is the physical game we talk about casinos 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.840
 inco of recreational machines with the whip days that monopolies handle 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.270
 their texts although lotteries and bets from the state the judge that although the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.160
 parties have an answer when they hear monopoly weight we have a point 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.809
 and they are doing good business 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.400
 as a result of that monopoly while it is not regulated 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.420
 they are left with all the benefits of the games they can 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.550
 tonight they are offering the same a very high percentage of bright of 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.400
 cinema of money that moves the players because they have no other expenses 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.710
 do not pay taxes do not pay character fees will be that the online game does 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.669
 damage to the pool 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.810
 as videla 1x2 with this new competitor the end of the season 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.590
 past had grown 10 percent percent 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.189
 This year will end with growth 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.120
 Approximately 12% 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.750
 then the pool is growing and it does not seem to be affecting it 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.540
 too much online game to the pool so far we do not see too much 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.240
 this is too much damage 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.050
 x-men pingdom someone takes advantage in this battle there is a sociological change 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.939
 important that has occurred 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.519
 although there is a profile of young people who demanded what is online gaming 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.889
 that is going to lift what I play by from the mobile phone system 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.529
 and these people want to do it is 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.999
 bet in a fast agile comfortable way when they want 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.979
 they do not want to find an administration that is closed to 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.090
 Ten o'clock at the same time they were afraid of a flat party who would 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.619
 they feel like betting 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:32.609
 in the pool loses young people but they know what to do to stop the 

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:34.639
 hit point umbria of the goal 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.380
 the population variable 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.580
 it is transcendental for nothing 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.389
 its operation 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.389
 that is the way 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.400
 the two parties agree a maximum 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.590
 a law is needed to regulate this new sector at this time the houses of 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.820
 bets can not operate from Spanish territory because there is no 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.949
 norm that contemplates it 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.770
 all these companies reside in countries where it is legal england ireland 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.409
 Austria Cyprus and Italy 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.069
 so in Spain these companies do not operate but it is possible to play 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:09.740
 on-line 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.879
 something that for example is prohibited in the United States 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.610
 in what remains of regulation 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.639
 what happens with this type of game 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:19.620
 it is not regulated therefore 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.449
 everything that is happening through the internet 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.159
 Well, regular 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:25.490
 legal spark 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.080
 we want this to be regulated and to be able to work calmly 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.650
 just as we do to the united kingdom just as we are going to demand the center of 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.860
 attention and united kingdom 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.740
 and that allows us to operate freely within the European Union before it emptied 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.889
 legal there is no what is there is a lack legislation some countries that do not 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.039
 they had traditions that in this sector
