 stack I didn't understand 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 okay then we look after it seems 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.119
 some good stadiums 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.700
 no placement of CC data records is possible 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.189
 that is to say it can cost about 3000 e 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.320
 4000 so maybe it could be a lot 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.780
 feel that I am quite gassed there 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250
 they are objects in your flood 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.420

 I did n't see a Turk if he was seen 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.690
 I am not mistaken is shortsighted nur for those who saw 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.110
 when I was a liga team 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.720

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.980
 but honestly I already know that anyway 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.250

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.959
