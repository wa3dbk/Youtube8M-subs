to produce a power supply that even four

to produce a power supply that even four
or<00:00:35.820> five<00:00:36.180> years<00:00:36.540> ago<00:00:36.840> would<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.500> been<00:00:37.770> as

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
or five years ago would have been as

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.520 
or five years ago would have been as
high-end<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> gets<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.780> terms<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
high-end as it gets in terms of the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
high-end as it gets in terms of the
wattage<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> outputs<00:00:41.390> not<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
wattage that it outputs not only that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.600 
wattage that it outputs not only that
but<00:00:43.379> actually<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> need<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.489> little

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
but actually I need this for a little

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
but actually I need this for a little
bit<00:00:44.700> longer<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.329> crank<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> efficiency

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
bit longer but crank up the efficiency

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
bit longer but crank up the efficiency
to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> point<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> thing<00:00:48.210> doesn't

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to the point where the thing doesn't

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
to the point where the thing doesn't
even<00:00:48.989> need<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> fan<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.489> confident

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
even need a fan and they are confident

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.959 
even need a fan and they are confident

freaking fan for seven years and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.490 
freaking fan for seven years and
actually<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> chance<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> happening

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
actually have a chance of that happening

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
actually have a chance of that happening
well<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.100> chance<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.030> they're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
well not just chance I'm sure if they're

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
well not just chance I'm sure if they're
putting<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> seven-year<00:01:03.870> warranty<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
putting a seven-year warranty on it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
putting a seven-year warranty on it
their<00:01:04.949> actual<00:01:05.460> mean<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.909> between<00:01:05.939> failure

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
their actual mean time between failure

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
their actual mean time between failure
is<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.140> significantly<00:01:07.799> longer<00:01:08.070> than

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is going to be significantly longer than

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
is going to be significantly longer than
that<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.939> generally<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that because that's generally how that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.310 
that because that's generally how that
works

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
works

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.679

top<00:02:08.819> cover<00:02:09.119> facing<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> common<00:02:10.500> sense

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
top cover facing up this is common sense

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.490 
top cover facing up this is common sense
but<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.160> good<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.670> say<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
but it's a good thing they say so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.440 
but it's a good thing they say so
someone<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.610> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.850> install<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.330> like

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
someone was going to install it like

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.720 
someone was going to install it like
this<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.020> they<00:02:15.380> were<00:02:15.440> going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
this and they were going to have the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.670 
this and they were going to have the
heat<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:17.420> actually<00:02:17.960> be<00:02:18.110> able<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.500> rise

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
heat not actually be able to rise

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.710 
heat not actually be able to rise
anywhere<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.700> way<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.060> designed<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
anywhere so the way this is designed is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.050 
anywhere so the way this is designed is
for<00:02:20.900> natural<00:02:21.380> convection<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:22.010> take<00:02:22.190> place<00:02:22.460> so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
for natural convection to take place so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.940 
for natural convection to take place so
a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.420> bit<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.720> air<00:02:24.020> will<00:02:24.260> come<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.620> here

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
a little bit of air will come in here

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.830 
a little bit of air will come in here
and<00:02:25.070> we'll<00:02:25.580> walked<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.390> top<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and we'll walked out the top of the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.750 
and we'll walked out the top of the
power<00:02:27.020> supply<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> how<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.640> is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
power supply and that is how it is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670 
power supply and that is how it is
intended<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.240> be<00:02:29.360> cooled<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.230> we're<00:02:30.560> actually

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
intended to be cooled so we're actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.840 
intended to be cooled so we're actually
going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.040> take<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.310> off<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.760> can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
going to take this off so you can

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.250 
going to take this off so you can
actually<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.360> there's<00:02:32.570> nice<00:02:32.720> tall<00:02:33.020> heat

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
actually see there's nice tall heat

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.199 
actually see there's nice tall heat
sinks<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:33.830> see<00:02:34.250> those<00:02:34.459> ones<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:35.030> by

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
sinks in there see those ones right by

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.270 
sinks in there see those ones right by
the<00:02:35.270> side<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.350> near<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.709> intake<00:02:37.130> that

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the side that are near that intake that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.310 
the side that are near that intake that
I<00:02:37.400> showed<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:37.970> side<00:02:38.300> that's<00:02:38.870> how<00:02:39.140> it's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
I showed you on the side that's how it's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.810 
I showed you on the side that's how it's
supposed<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.650> work<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.160> designed<00:02:40.550> for<00:02:40.760> that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
supposed to work it is designed for that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.300 
supposed to work it is designed for that
if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.510> run<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.290> configuration<00:02:42.620> other

see sonic would kind of give you the
please<00:02:50.330> don't<00:02:50.510> do<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.989> because<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.890> might

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
please don't do that because that might

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.060 
please don't do that because that might
explode<00:02:52.760> things<00:02:53.060> sort<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.900> speech<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.590> make

actually a pretty good mix and then I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.229 
actually a pretty good mix and then I
suspect<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> other<00:03:37.459> one<00:03:37.670> we're<00:03:38.090> going<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
suspect in the other one we're going to

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.710 
suspect in the other one we're going to
find<00:03:38.480> things<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:38.870> 24<00:03:39.530> pin<00:03:39.799> PCIe<00:03:40.730> and

anything<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:54.560> alright<00:04:54.919> my<00:04:55.130> suspicion<00:04:55.730> for<00:04:55.910> how

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
anything so alright my suspicion for how

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.700 
anything so alright my suspicion for how
they<00:04:56.150> did<00:04:56.300> this<00:04:56.480> right<00:04:56.690> because<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.470> don't<00:04:57.500> know

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
they did this right because I don't know

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.200 
they did this right because I don't know
if<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.830> guys<00:04:57.950> know<00:04:58.130> this<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:58.340> C<00:04:58.610> sonic<00:04:58.940> has<00:04:59.180> a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
if you guys know this but C sonic has a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.780 
if you guys know this but C sonic has a
thousand<00:04:59.930> watt<00:05:00.080> unit<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.979> doesn't<00:05:01.700> even

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
thousand watt unit that doesn't even

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.700 
thousand watt unit that doesn't even
turn<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.270> fan<00:05:02.510> until<00:05:02.840> fifty<00:05:03.169> percent<00:05:03.470> so

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
turn on the fan until fifty percent so

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.110 
turn on the fan until fifty percent so
if<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.919> do<00:05:04.040> sort<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.430> rough<00:05:04.610> mental<00:05:04.940> math

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
if you do sort of the rough mental math

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
if you do sort of the rough mental math
that's<00:05:05.660> about<00:05:06.729> 500<00:05:07.729> watts<00:05:07.910> so<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.419> suspect<00:05:08.720> when

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
that's about 500 watts so I suspect when

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.450 
that's about 500 watts so I suspect when
you<00:05:09.229> buy<00:05:09.410> this<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.860> price<00:05:10.040> is<00:05:10.190> going<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.370> be

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
you buy this the price is going to be

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.100 
you buy this the price is going to be
pretty<00:05:10.729> high<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:11.780> you're<00:05:11.960> actually

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
pretty high and what you're actually

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.909 
pretty high and what you're actually
getting<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:13.160> probably<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:14.030> much<00:05:14.570> much<00:05:15.290> beefier

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
getting is probably a much much beefier

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.550 
getting is probably a much much beefier
power<00:05:16.250> supply<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:17.450> is<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:17.960> sort<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.260> scaled

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
power supply that is just sort of scaled

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.930 
power supply that is just sort of scaled
down<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.220> they<00:05:19.310> can<00:05:19.460> run<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.700> without<00:05:19.790> a

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
down so that they can run it without a

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.600 
down so that they can run it without a
fan<00:05:20.210> however<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.140> advantage<00:05:21.290> of<00:05:22.010> buying<00:05:22.370> this

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
fan however the advantage of buying this

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.460 
fan however the advantage of buying this
versus<00:05:23.120> just<00:05:23.330> buying<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.750> thousand<00:05:24.140> watt<00:05:24.290> is

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
versus just buying the thousand watt is

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.830 
versus just buying the thousand watt is
that<00:05:24.950> this<00:05:25.130> one<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.370> going<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.850> get<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.360> proper

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
that this one is going to get the proper

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.830 
that this one is going to get the proper
efficiency<00:05:27.800> at<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:29.000> kind<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.300> system<00:05:29.630> loads

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
efficiency at the kind of system loads

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.060 
efficiency at the kind of system loads
that<00:05:30.050> you're<00:05:30.140> going<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.320> be<00:05:30.410> using<00:05:30.710> it<00:05:30.800> with<00:05:30.830> so

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
that you're going to be using it with so

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.230 
that you're going to be using it with so
when<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.280> run<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> thousand<00:05:31.970> watt<00:05:32.090> power

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
when you run a thousand watt power

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.020 
when you run a thousand watt power
supply<00:05:32.390> at<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:33.740> know<00:05:33.860> 200<00:05:34.040> Watts<00:05:34.520> under<00:05:34.850> load

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.219 
supply at you know 200 Watts under load
with<00:05:35.240> your<00:05:35.360> system<00:05:35.690> because<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.110> have<00:05:36.200> a

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
with your system because you have a

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.260 
with your system because you have a
power<00:05:36.530> silence<00:05:37.070> optimized<00:05:37.460> system<00:05:37.880> you're

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
power silence optimized system you're

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.120 
power silence optimized system you're
actually<00:05:38.630> getting<00:05:38.780> like<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.500> worst<00:05:39.740> possible

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
actually getting like the worst possible

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.790 
actually getting like the worst possible
efficiency<00:05:41.000> on<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.780> curve<00:05:42.229> which<00:05:42.560> they

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
efficiency on that curve which they

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.040 
efficiency on that curve which they
conveniently<00:05:43.220> do<00:05:43.669> not<00:05:43.850> have<00:05:44.060> on<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.330> box<00:05:44.630> but

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
conveniently do not have on this box but

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.600 
conveniently do not have on this box but
on<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.350> efficiency<00:05:45.860> curve<00:05:46.070> which<00:05:46.310> basically

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
on the efficiency curve which basically

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.340 
on the efficiency curve which basically
goes<00:05:46.850> not<00:05:47.090> a<00:05:47.120> very<00:05:47.390> efficient<00:05:47.780> very<00:05:47.810> very<00:05:48.169> very

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
goes not a very efficient very very very

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.719 
goes not a very efficient very very very
efficient<00:05:48.830> and<00:05:48.979> then<00:05:49.070> kind<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.310> tails<00:05:49.550> down

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
efficient and then kind of tails down

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.940 
efficient and then kind of tails down
like<00:05:49.970> that<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.900> you're<00:05:51.229> better<00:05:51.410> off<00:05:51.470> to<00:05:51.740> run<00:05:51.919> a

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
like that so you're better off to run a

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.230 
like that so you're better off to run a
lower<00:05:52.220> wattage<00:05:52.400> power<00:05:52.789> supply

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
lower wattage power supply

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.070 
lower wattage power supply
you're<00:05:53.360> not<00:05:53.479> going<00:05:53.630> to<00:05:53.660> use<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.960> full

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
you're not going to use the full

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.529 
you're not going to use the full
capacity<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.620> it<00:05:54.800> patented<00:05:55.490> DC<00:05:56.090> connector

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:57.969 
capacity of it patented DC connector

so<00:05:58.220> basically<00:05:58.639> what<00:05:58.789> they're<00:05:58.940> trying<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.180> say

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
so basically what they're trying to say

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.230 
so basically what they're trying to say
here<00:05:59.660> it<00:06:00.110> was<00:06:00.349> 105<00:06:01.039> degrees<00:06:01.400> Celsius<00:06:01.849> Japanese

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
here it was 105 degrees Celsius Japanese

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.629
