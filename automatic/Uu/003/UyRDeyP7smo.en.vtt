00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
just the air tankers that put it out

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
just the air tankers that put it out
they<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.270> fly<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.690> night<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:13.110> isn't<00:02:13.350> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
they don't fly at night it isn't just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.250 
they don't fly at night it isn't just
the<00:02:13.530> helicopters<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.209> water<00:02:15.780> tenders

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the helicopters it's the water tenders

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.509 
the helicopters it's the water tenders
the<00:02:16.410> crews<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.860> dough's<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> whole

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
the crews the dough's it's the whole

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.860 
the crews the dough's it's the whole
combination<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> take<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
combination so it's going to take a
