00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
kind of disappointing I was really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.690 
kind of disappointing I was really
hoping<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> was<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> squash<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.640> the

sunlight for the weeds and stuff to grow

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.940 
sunlight for the weeds and stuff to grow

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so but I will I'll check on it again in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.850 
so but I will I'll check on it again in
another<00:01:12.990> couple<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> months<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.750> we'll

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
another couple of months or so and we'll

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
another couple of months or so and we'll
double<00:01:16.860> check<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.390> keep<00:01:18.390> checking<00:01:18.600> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
double check it keep checking on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
double check it keep checking on
hopefully<00:01:19.170> we'll<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.439> something<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.950> planted

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hopefully we'll get something we planted

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
hopefully we'll get something we planted
a<00:01:20.400> good<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> good<00:01:21.299> couple

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
a good I don't know a good couple

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
a good I don't know a good couple
hundred<00:01:21.930> seeds<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.439> anyway<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
hundred seeds out here anyway and I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.679 
hundred seeds out here anyway and I
would<00:01:24.600> hate<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.259> wasted<00:01:25.590> them

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
would hate to think that we wasted them

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
would hate to think that we wasted them
but<00:01:27.799> seeds<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.729> easy<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
but seeds are you know pretty easy to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.960 
but seeds are you know pretty easy to
come<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.520> said<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:35.850> had<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
come by but like I said I've had a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560 
come by but like I said I've had a
couple<00:01:36.180> people<00:01:36.329> ask<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
couple people ask and so it kind of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.719 
couple people ask and so it kind of
sparked<00:01:40.049> my<00:01:40.200> interest<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.829> well<00:01:41.009> figured<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
sparked my interest as well figured I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.230 
sparked my interest as well figured I
would<00:01:41.850> walk<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
would walk out here and see what we

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.510 
would walk out here and see what we
could<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:49.020> anything

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
could see and I don't see anything

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.780 
could see and I don't see anything
except<00:01:50.520> weeds<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.890> said<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.430> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
except weeds and like I said it's a it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.929 
except weeds and like I said it's a it's
a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> disheartening<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> same

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a little disheartening but at the same

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.440 
a little disheartening but at the same
time<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> live<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.439> learn<00:01:59.450> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
time you know you live and learn and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
time you know you live and learn and
there<00:02:01.380> may<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.590> may<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.399> some

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there may just may have to make some

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
there may just may have to make some
adjustments<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.180> we're<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.530> need

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
adjustments if we're if you really need

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.089 
adjustments if we're if you really need
to<00:02:04.829> use<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.549> point<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> garden

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
to use this at some point as a garden

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.330 
to use this at some point as a garden
that<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.220> may<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.890> clear<00:02:10.890> out<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that we may have to clear out some of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.740 
that we may have to clear out some of
the<00:02:11.400> trees<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.970> get<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.660> more

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the trees to get to get a little more

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.320 
the trees to get to get a little more
light<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.200> here

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
light in here

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.400 
light in here
I'll<00:02:15.330> clear<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.540> some<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.930> trees<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
I'll clear out some of the trees and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
I'll clear out some of the trees and
some<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.190> limbs<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> stuff<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
some of the limbs and stuff like that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.800 
some of the limbs and stuff like that
but<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:19.010> guess<00:02:20.010> we'll<00:02:20.340> take<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.540> come

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
but I guess we'll take that as we come

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:30.280 
but I guess we'll take that as we come
as<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> go<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.910> where

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
as we go so there you go that is where

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.580 
as we go so there you go that is where
our<00:02:33.740> gorilla<00:02:34.740> garden<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.190> anyway<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
our gorilla garden is anyway or the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.050 
our gorilla garden is anyway or the
woods<00:02:37.770> garden<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.310> whatever<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.880> one

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
woods garden or whatever it is it's one

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.120 
woods garden or whatever it is it's one
that<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.410> call<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.950> where

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that you want to call it this is where

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.690 
that you want to call it this is where
it<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:42.830> well<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> looks<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.400> may<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it is well it looks like we may have a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.950 
it is well it looks like we may have a
sprout<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.270> there

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
sprout right there

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
sprout right there
I<00:02:49.160> may<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.460> coming<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.820> right<00:02:51.000> there

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
I may have one coming up right there

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.230 
I may have one coming up right there
so<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.190> said<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.610> know<00:02:53.760> maybe<00:02:54.060> it's

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
so like I said I don't know maybe it's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.940 
so like I said I don't know maybe it's
just<00:02:54.330> still<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:54.930> early<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.590> only<00:02:55.710> been

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
just still a little early it's only been

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.290 
just still a little early it's only been
about<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:57.030> know<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.210> long

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
about I don't know I don't know how long

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.580 
about I don't know I don't know how long
was<00:02:57.450> then<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.930> been<00:02:58.050> about<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.260> month<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
was then it's been about a month and a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.520 
was then it's been about a month and a
half<00:02:58.650> or<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.600> but<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.660> would<00:03:00.990> figure<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
half or so but I would figure that the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.390 
half or so but I would figure that the
sprouts<00:03:01.800> were<00:03:01.980> sprouted<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:04.250> there<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:05.370> be

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
sprouts were sprouted and there would be

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
sprouts were sprouted and there would be
some<00:03:05.700> decent<00:03:05.850> size<00:03:06.180> plants<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.080> was

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
some decent size plants up if it was

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.650 
some decent size plants up if it was
gonna<00:03:07.350> work<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:09.330> who<00:03:09.780> knows<00:03:09.960> this<00:03:10.230> has<00:03:10.380> been<00:03:10.590> a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
gonna work but who knows this has been a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.040 
gonna work but who knows this has been a
pretty<00:03:12.660> crazy<00:03:12.930> spring<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.650> us<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:13.920> far<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.780> we

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
pretty crazy spring for us so far and we

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.360 
pretty crazy spring for us so far and we
just<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:16.320> know<00:03:16.410> what's<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:16.830> on<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.950> do<00:03:17.130> see

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
just don't know what's going on I do see

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.720 
just don't know what's going on I do see
a<00:03:17.400> lot<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.580> scratch<00:03:17.880> marks<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.300> grounds

mark<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.200> I'll<00:03:22.320> probably<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:23.120> had<00:03:24.120> our

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270
