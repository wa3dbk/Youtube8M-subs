I'm<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> show<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.900> expect<00:00:09.929> to

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
I'm going to show you what to expect to

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:30.460 
I'm going to show you what to expect to
pay<00:00:10.759> to<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.910> 30<00:00:12.150> sighs<00:00:12.420> helicopter<00:00:12.750> running

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:42.229 

that's<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:34.250> kit<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> I'll

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
that's what you get in the kit so I'll

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
that's what you get in the kit so I'll
take<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> canopy<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> show<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.829> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
take the canopy off and show you some of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
take the canopy off and show you some of
the<00:00:43.980> components<00:00:45.170> inside<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> have

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the components inside so here you have

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
the components inside so here you have
the<00:00:52.350> receiver<00:00:53.360> which<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> purchase<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.450> boat<00:01:42.450> watch<00:01:42.689> which<00:01:43.170> basically<00:01:45.259> tells

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
have a boat watch which basically tells

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.300 
have a boat watch which basically tells
you<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:46.439> much<00:01:46.560> voltage<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> your

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you how much voltage you have in your

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
you how much voltage you have in your
battery<00:01:47.640> whether<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> should<00:01:48.479> fly<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
battery whether you should fly or you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
battery whether you should fly or you
should<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.710> fly<00:01:50.840> here<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.970> another

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
should not fly here we have another

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.440 
should not fly here we have another
servo<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> Futaba<00:01:56.219> s<00:01:57.079> 3151

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.990 

now<00:02:03.050> all<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.440> electronics<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.760> showed

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
now all the electronics that I showed

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760 
now all the electronics that I showed
you<00:02:05.090> except<00:02:05.479> for<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.720> gyro<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.560> tail

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
you except for the gyro and the tail

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.199 
you except for the gyro and the tail
servo<00:02:07.630> came<00:02:08.630> with<00:02:08.780> my<00:02:08.929> who<00:02:08.990> table<00:02:09.580> seven<00:02:10.580> CHP

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
servo came with my who table seven CHP

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.660 
servo came with my who table seven CHP
heli<00:02:12.140> radio<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.770> radio<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.400> four

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
heli radio so with this radio I got four

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.020 
heli radio so with this radio I got four
servos<00:02:17.150> which<00:02:17.420> were<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.720> Futaba<00:02:18.140> s<00:02:19.030> 31:51

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
servos which were the Futaba s 31:51

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.390 
servos which were the Futaba s 31:51
servos<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.720> four<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.959> those<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.470> got<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
servos I got four of those I got the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.250 
servos I got four of those I got the
receiver<00:02:22.760> which<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> seven<00:02:23.540> actually<00:02:24.170> it's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
receiver which is a seven actually it's

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.960 
receiver which is a seven actually it's
an<00:02:24.350> 8<00:02:24.440> channel<00:02:24.500> receiver<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.190> believe<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.880> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
an 8 channel receiver I believe and I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.790 
an 8 channel receiver I believe and I
got<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> battery<00:02:29.570> here<00:02:29.840> as<00:02:30.440> well<00:02:30.680> as<00:02:30.770> a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
got the battery here as well as a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.199 
got the battery here as well as a
charger<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.459> battery<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.850> charger

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
charger for the battery in the charger

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:43.570 
charger for the battery in the charger
for<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.660> radio<00:02:41.980> I'll<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.190> show<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.430> this

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
for the radio I'll just show you this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.300 
for the radio I'll just show you this
there<00:02:43.790> wasn't<00:02:43.940> either<00:02:44.120> side<00:02:44.450> here<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
there wasn't either side here and the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.229 
there wasn't either side here and the
servo<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:46.970> came<00:02:47.300> with<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.600> gyro<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.440> S

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
servo that came with the gyro is the S

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.259 
servo that came with the gyro is the S
92<00:02:50.239> 54<00:02:50.959> servo<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> kick<00:02:55.970> gives<00:02:56.180> you

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
92 54 servo so the kick gives you

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.949 
92 54 servo so the kick gives you
basically<00:02:56.570> everything<00:02:58.510> mechanical<00:02:59.510> on<00:02:59.870> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
basically everything mechanical on the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.570 
basically everything mechanical on the
heli<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.350> blade<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.910> tail<00:03:02.660> blades<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
heli the blade the tail blades and the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.910 
heli the blade the tail blades and the
airframe

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.020 

you<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.129> purchase<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.489> engine<00:03:09.909> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
you have to purchase the engine and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.000 
you have to purchase the engine and
electronics<00:03:10.540> separately<00:03:11.170> from<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.620> kit
