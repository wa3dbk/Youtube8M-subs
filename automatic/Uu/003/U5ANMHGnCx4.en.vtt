00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.170 

all<00:01:12.729> right<00:01:13.200> well<00:01:17.100> here's<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.250> normal<00:01:18.700> more

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.280 

so<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.310> mean<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:50.240> can't<00:01:50.480> tell<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> difference

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
so I mean you can't tell a difference

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:00.110 
so I mean you can't tell a difference
but<00:01:51.530> there<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.800> more<00:01:52.010> blood<00:01:52.310> there

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
I mean it's not like a significant
amount<00:02:02.940> but<00:02:04.430> it's<00:02:05.430> noticeable<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.570> there's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
amount but it's noticeable so there's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.440 
amount but it's noticeable so there's
more<00:02:09.900> blood<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:14.930> then<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.850> chi<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> found<00:02:18.210> from
