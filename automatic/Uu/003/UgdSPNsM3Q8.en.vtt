00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:10.277
 Sorry, but who would you be? 

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.257
 &lt;i&gt; Leon Kennedy, sir. The academy sends me. &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:15.970
 &lt;i&gt; We've been pretty overworked lately. &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 &lt;i&gt; Yeah, half of the agents are sick and we get all the work. &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.310
 &lt;i&gt; Crazy stuff. &lt;/i&gt;

 EPISODE 2 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.149
 Sir, my name is Leon Kennedy and I'm a police officer. 

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.226
 Sir, stay where you are. 

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.610
 Stand back, please, or I'll have to shoot you! 

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.775
 - What do you think you're doing? - Your job. 

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:06.796
 He shot him. 

00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:08.954
 After three warnings, it seems to me the minimum. 

00:01:10.384 --> 00:01:12.273
 Oh shit. 

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:15.020
 If he was ... eating? 

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:33.508
 What happened here? 

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:35.447
 He tried to attack us. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.373
 Looks like William, or at least what's left of it. 

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:41.966
 Jesus'... 

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:43.627
 And the wife? 

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:46.556
 I didn't find her, she wasn't in the house. 

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:49.681
 Everything good? 

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:51.370
 It was dead. 

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:53.995
 - Really? - Richard shot him. 

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:55.836
 We thought he was dead and then ... 

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:58.620
 I really mean it. 

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.353
 The rookie is right. 

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:11.168
 I checked his wrist. 

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:12.650
 It was dead. 

00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:16.910
 Do you think it has anything to do with what happened ... 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.605
 at the Spencer's estate? 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.682
 I do not know. 

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.731
 But this is not just cannibalism. 

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:45.706
 Lord? 

00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:56.987
 Take it away from here, you better not see it. 

00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:06.162
 Treasure... 

00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:09.020
 Sorry for the intrusion. 

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:15.171
 I checked in the house, but nobody was there. 

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:20.919
 It's all ... 

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:24.895
 Oh God. 

00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:26.030
 Philip, wait! 

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:32.313
 Stay back! 

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:37.379
 Needless to waste time, newbie. 

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.301
 Here we go. 

00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:53.961
 Keep it going...
