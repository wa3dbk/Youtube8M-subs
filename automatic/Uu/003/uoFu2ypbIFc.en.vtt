00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
not an issue because of the way this

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.800 
not an issue because of the way this
pack<00:06:05.700> is<00:06:05.910> designed<00:06:06.330> because<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:09.450> way<00:06:09.630> the

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
pack is designed because of the way the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.440 
pack is designed because of the way the
bag<00:06:09.990> fits<00:06:10.440> underneath<00:06:10.890> your<00:06:11.280> shoulder<00:06:11.790> this

part right here your arm will cover this

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.920 
part right here your arm will cover this
part<00:06:15.630> so<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:16.080> is

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
part so it is

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.500 
part so it is
impossible<00:06:17.930> for<00:06:18.620> someone<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.220> pickpocket<00:06:19.850> you

you<00:06:23.660> know<00:06:24.020> egg<00:06:24.290> it's<00:06:24.500> not<00:06:24.710> a<00:06:24.740> structured<00:06:25.370> bag

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
you know egg it's not a structured bag

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.940 
you know egg it's not a structured bag
so<00:06:26.390> you<00:06:26.450> can<00:06:26.690> see<00:06:26.930> and<00:06:27.170> that's<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.710> great<00:06:27.890> thing

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
so you can see and that's a great thing

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.220 
so you can see and that's a great thing
because<00:06:28.280> as<00:06:28.670> you<00:06:28.820> can<00:06:29.000> tell<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.480> face<00:06:29.720> itself

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
because as you can tell the face itself

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.340 
because as you can tell the face itself
is<00:06:30.500> nice<00:06:30.920> inches<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.730> thickness<00:06:32.210> but<00:06:32.870> because

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
is nice inches and thickness but because

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.650 
is nice inches and thickness but because
it's<00:06:33.650> not<00:06:33.890> very<00:06:34.310> structured<00:06:35.030> when<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.420> put

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
it's not very structured when you put

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.140 
it's not very structured when you put
this<00:06:35.840> back<00:06:36.080> on<00:06:36.440> your<00:06:36.680> shoulder<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.550> put

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
this back on your shoulder and you put

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.120 
this back on your shoulder and you put
your<00:06:38.330> hands<00:06:38.600> down<00:06:38.780> it<00:06:39.170> doesn't<00:06:39.530> stick<00:06:39.830> out

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
your hands down it doesn't stick out

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.450 
your hands down it doesn't stick out
very<00:06:40.880> far<00:06:41.210> unlike<00:06:41.930> if<00:06:42.110> you<00:06:42.260> have<00:06:42.500> a<00:06:42.800> bag<00:06:43.430> that

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
very far unlike if you have a bag that

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.600 
very far unlike if you have a bag that
has<00:06:43.760> a<00:06:44.500> structured<00:06:45.500> face<00:06:45.770> like<00:06:46.100> that

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
has a structured face like that

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.840 
has a structured face like that
