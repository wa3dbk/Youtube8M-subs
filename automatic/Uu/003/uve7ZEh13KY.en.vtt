00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
and guess what rear taillights for

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.390 
and guess what rear taillights for
backing<00:04:42.889> up<00:04:43.009> and<00:04:43.630> braking<00:04:44.710> then<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.919> has<00:04:46.100> one

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
backing up and braking then it has one

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.999 
backing up and braking then it has one
of<00:04:46.490> these<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.850> think<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.330> clock<00:04:47.630> top<00:04:48.009> it

of these I think it's a clock top it

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.219 
of these I think it's a clock top it
lifts<00:04:49.490> up<00:04:49.610> in<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.910> diagonal<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.660> can<00:04:50.840> camp
