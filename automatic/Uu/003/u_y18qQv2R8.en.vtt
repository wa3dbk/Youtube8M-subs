00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 I'm 28 years old 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 the video city 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.709
 I saw the csa wine cooperatives refuses any comment thanks to 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:15.779
 compass 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.150
 it's locked up this formal agreement that meets most of the time 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.189
 I was at the head 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.710
 I started to remember at 17 I released a first maxi in 2003 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.890
 dependent on his loans for the hour of service with more of his productions 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 we did for a little radio tour here that promises but it's 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.430
 a nice team and so much better if affiliates my dilemma the carabins 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 France and its public in 2006 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.960
 and this little world like in 2008 at the end of his nose 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.900
 the first album 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 say it takes to progress 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 oil prices 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.380
 4 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.630
 there it's done 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.240
 always in trouble with bordeaux I can no longer then he went all 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.620
 was not at all 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 hung per week 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.049
 it's the american rap not liked at all and i really had a shot of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 hot on the group seb electric to a french rap group 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 spread flap 26 27 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.730
 unfortunately today simple for me because europe 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.580
 That can not continue 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.080
 the argument available to you is from there I believe it does 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 cold hunger disease 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 no 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 in a neighborhood 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.260
 music softens to let it know 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.300
 words as I like words 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.540
 it's the least of the things is a genre 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.630
 on the stroke on 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 little by little but the next day with the allies like that a view a little 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.500
 later 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 of harcourt 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 fever 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.059
 I try to mix everything and let it appear 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.209
 the blockade in a box but at some point this is another example of 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.759
 tell young people who his paintings and his tributaries 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.759
 to do something with the public 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.759
 the struggle for power in the congo 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.939
 product offer 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.079
 live 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.079
 no 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 laurent 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.709
 to speak a little bit 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.090
 of my generation 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.389
 it is to present a fighter 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.749
 of all those people who are in a hurry to be autonomous in a hurry to do 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.269
 things like the law on parity to be 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.279
 head out the album to be between serves all that 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.629
 I was trying to leave legally 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.629
 cowen 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.060
 in 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.900
 this is the sign that m all doors tomorrow is a sore 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.249
 if at the album level 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.959
 stop being a little money tic at the level of sounds we will find a 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.199
 little portrait of a door 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.319
 ping 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.369
 jr 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.779
 the way was traced 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.499
 15 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.949
 your album 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 the two countries will exchange 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.049
 29th then he's mostly the first one points to stay the course stay 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:52.899
 connected 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.829
 onergie with the arms I had sung cni furtado 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.289
 at the end of the eighth of 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.599
 the lessons of his staff knew I wanted to start moving on an album 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.149
 in English we put in relation initially with the type manager 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.879
 ball 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.340
 because I read or said 'what do you like who you love 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.090
 as a producer all that necessarily I'm happy because it was his 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.179
 aimed since for years I'm in college that I took 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.109
 hope this would create a vaccine 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.749
 Unlike me 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.749
 in parallel 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.379
 you enter the story 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.610
 rko - belgium I think they have a much more Anglo-Saxon culture 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.629
 just in France 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.629
 yet it speaks French or if I go down amended mentality 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:43.999
 different all that 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.580
 and it's true that in France conservative enough and he is too focused on 

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.639
 the text and the message of funds not from an entertainment side of the 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.979
 music I'm on some projects in a surprise duo we can not yet 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.439
 reveal the name for the moment but with an artist's view 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.610
 a recognized artist 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.979
 in the pop my goal is not necessarily the united states these two 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:09.219
 it's talent in a maximum of countries no matter where it's there it's true that 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.199
 it's very very good start 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.889
 canivenq of spain 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.240
 many things outside 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.669
 in latin america + 2 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.050
 in south africa this is his share even faster to the land good i'm going to spend 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.219

 what is the temperature oscillates 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.759
