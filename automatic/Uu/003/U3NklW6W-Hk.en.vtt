hello youtubers today I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.000> make<00:00:03.360> particular<00:00:03.780> bacterial

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
you how to make particular bacterial

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
you how to make particular bacterial
cultures<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.339> how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> prepare<00:00:06.210> everything

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
cultures and how to prepare everything

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.610 
cultures and how to prepare everything
for<00:00:07.290> it

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
for it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.890

protection this is for protection of
petri<00:00:21.270> dishes<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.710> surface<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.980> agar<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.210> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
petri dishes and surface of agar so you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.429 
petri dishes and surface of agar so you
don't<00:00:25.010> spit<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.630> want<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
don't spit on it and you don't want to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.950 
don't spit on it and you don't want to
have<00:00:28.710> something<00:00:29.010> from<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.609> mouth<00:00:29.789> mouth<00:00:30.599> on

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
it so when you're ready to make a
bacterial<00:00:34.800> culture<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.880> main<00:00:36.000> ingredient<00:00:36.750> in

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
bacterial culture the main ingredient in

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.090 
bacterial culture the main ingredient in
greeting<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> need<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.329> agar

greeting you are going to need is agar

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.900 
greeting you are going to need is agar
so<00:00:41.480> as<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.920> yellow<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.430> car

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so as you can see it's a yellow with car

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.910 
so as you can see it's a yellow with car
color<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.370> buy<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.850> real

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
color and you can buy a real

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
color and you can buy a real
microbiology<00:00:50.030> agar<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:52.020> those<00:00:52.350> are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
microbiology agar but those are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
microbiology agar but those are
expensive<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.480> where<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.899> can

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
expensive and I don't know where you can

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.189 
expensive and I don't know where you can
buy<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> cooking<00:00:57.329> anger<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
buy it but this is cooking anger for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.490 
buy it but this is cooking anger for
cooking<00:00:59.390> for<00:01:00.390> cakes<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.989> something<00:01:01.469> like

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cooking for cakes and something like

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
cooking for cakes and something like
that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.890 
that
so<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.989> add<00:01:04.229> 2<00:01:04.920> teaspoons<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.750> know

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so you add 2 teaspoons to I don't know

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
so you add 2 teaspoons to I don't know
maybe<00:01:07.140> 50<00:01:07.619> milliliters<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.549> later<00:01:08.909> I'll

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
maybe 50 milliliters of it later I'll

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289 
maybe 50 milliliters of it later I'll
make<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> video<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.350> how<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:11.100> prepare<00:01:11.460> agar<00:01:11.939> for

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
make a video of how to prepare agar for

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
make a video of how to prepare agar for
bacteria<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> cook<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.189> pour<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
bacteria so when you cook it you pour it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.749 
bacteria so when you cook it you pour it
in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> sterilized<00:01:18.810> petri<00:01:19.530> dishes<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:23.189> how

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
in a sterilized petri dishes so how

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
in a sterilized petri dishes so how
you're<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> sterilize<00:01:24.960> petri<00:01:25.500> dishes

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you're going to sterilize petri dishes

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
you're going to sterilize petri dishes
if<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.560> sterilizer<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
if you don't have a sterilizer so you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.640 
if you don't have a sterilizer so you
can<00:01:31.079> wash<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:34.070> dry<00:01:35.070> dry<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.650> put

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
can wash it and then dry dry it and put

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
can wash it and then dry dry it and put
in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> oven<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:39.170> 10<00:01:40.170> minutes<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:43.670> 150

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in the oven for 10 minutes on 150

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
in the oven for 10 minutes on 150
degrees<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> kill<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
degrees and up so you kill all the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
degrees and up so you kill all the
bacteria<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
bacteria is there on on in the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
bacteria is there on on in the
individual<00:01:53.159> juices<00:01:53.520> dishes<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:55.070> when<00:01:56.070> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
individual juices dishes and when this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.920 
individual juices dishes and when this
is<00:01:57.030> done<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:58.110> pour<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.829> agar<00:01:59.450> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> petri

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
is done you pour the agar into the petri

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.859 
is done you pour the agar into the petri
dishes<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:04.070> be<00:02:05.070> sure<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.899> not<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.520> open<00:02:08.520> them

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
dishes and be sure to not to open them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
dishes and be sure to not to open them
like<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.569> pour

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
like this just like this and then pour

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.760 
like this just like this and then pour

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
maybe 20 and wait for the agar to cool

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.370 
maybe 20 and wait for the agar to cool
down<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.310> when<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.460> cooled<00:02:41.730> down<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.380> are

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.600 
down and when it's cooled down you are
going<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.460> see<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.030> water

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.330 
going to see the water
condensate<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.500> don't<00:02:49.920> want<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
condensate on it so you don't want that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.550 
condensate on it so you don't want that
on<00:02:50.880> your<00:02:50.940> bacterial<00:02:51.900> cultures<00:02:52.290> because

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
on your bacterial cultures because

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.650 
on your bacterial cultures because
because<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.240> kill<00:02:54.510> your

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
because that is going to kill your

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.320 
because that is going to kill your
bacterias<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.870> after<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.730> make<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:02.330> after

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
bacterias so after you make the after

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.880 
bacterias so after you make the after
you<00:03:03.480> put<00:03:03.720> your<00:03:03.750> bacterias<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:06.710> turn<00:03:07.710> it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
you put your bacterias on it you turn it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.660 
you put your bacterias on it you turn it
over<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.350> how<00:03:10.920> you're<00:03:11.220> going<00:03:11.550> to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
over and this is how you're going to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.600 
over and this is how you're going to
keep<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.360> bacterias<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.260> next<00:03:13.710> week<00:03:14.070> so

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.820 

when<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.760> put<00:03:18.000> your<00:03:18.209> agar<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.200> set<00:03:19.680> it

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
when you put your agar on it you set it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.490 
when you put your agar on it you set it
somewhere<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.850> cool<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.920> take<00:03:22.920> your<00:03:23.130> swabs

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
somewhere to cool and take your swabs

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.040 
somewhere to cool and take your swabs
this<00:03:25.500> these<00:03:26.070> are<00:03:26.490> not<00:03:26.550> sterilized<00:03:27.390> whoops<00:03:27.780> I

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
course with gloves and when the agar is

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.830 
course with gloves and when the agar is
on<00:04:24.510> it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
on it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
you take bacterial samples with the swab

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.250 
you take bacterial samples with the swab
I<00:04:31.040> know<00:04:31.670> from<00:04:32.210> your<00:04:32.420> cell<00:04:32.780> phone

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
six days to bacterial cultures to grow

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.450 
six days to bacterial cultures to grow
you<00:05:20.030> can<00:05:20.300> check<00:05:20.840> every<00:05:21.320> day<00:05:23.590> open<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:24.980> see

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
you can check every day open it and see

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.990 
you can check every day open it and see
if<00:05:25.700> there<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.090> bacteria<00:05:26.300> spot<00:05:27.340> first<00:05:28.340> three<00:05:28.820> or

description so you can see them here I
have<00:06:19.720> my<00:06:20.720> small<00:06:22.000> culture<00:06:23.000> from<00:06:23.180> my<00:06:23.540> smartphone

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
have my small culture from my smartphone

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.980 
have my small culture from my smartphone
and<00:06:24.650> left<00:06:24.950> up<00:06:25.190> for<00:06:26.000> my<00:06:26.150> toothbrush<00:06:26.600> from

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
and left up for my toothbrush from

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:34.360 
and left up for my toothbrush from
hamsters<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:28.480> from<00:06:29.480> my<00:06:29.660> mouth<00:06:31.690> and<00:06:33.130> here<00:06:34.130> I

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
hamsters and from my mouth and here I

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.620 
hamsters and from my mouth and here I
have<00:06:34.820> pictures

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
have pictures

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.710 
have pictures
of<00:06:37.070> how<00:06:38.070> the<00:06:38.130> bacterial<00:06:38.930> cultures<00:06:39.930> look<00:06:40.580> these

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
of how the bacterial cultures look these

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.630 
of how the bacterial cultures look these
I<00:06:42.720> made<00:06:43.260> this<00:06:43.470> bacterial<00:06:44.280> cultures<00:06:46.250> as<00:06:47.250> you

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
I made this bacterial cultures as you

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:55.700 
I made this bacterial cultures as you
can<00:06:47.850> see<00:06:49.040> there<00:06:51.020> this<00:06:52.020> is<00:06:53.870> about<00:06:54.870> two

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
can see there this is about two

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:03.340 
can see there this is about two
millimeters<00:06:56.960> big<00:06:58.970> so<00:06:59.970> yeah

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.310 

there<00:07:04.350> is<00:07:04.500> it<00:07:04.650> for<00:07:05.150> making<00:07:06.150> of<00:07:06.360> bacterial

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
there is it for making of bacterial

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.060 
there is it for making of bacterial
cultures<00:07:07.740> I<00:07:08.040> will<00:07:09.030> put<00:07:09.300> a<00:07:09.510> video<00:07:09.660> of<00:07:10.070> real

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
cultures I will put a video of real

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.190 
cultures I will put a video of real
process<00:07:11.880> step<00:07:12.810> by<00:07:12.840> step<00:07:13.790> making<00:07:14.790> of<00:07:15.240> bacterial

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
process step by step making of bacterial

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.630 
process step by step making of bacterial
culture<00:07:16.620> in<00:07:17.460> another<00:07:17.700> video<00:07:18.150> so<00:07:19.110> you<00:07:20.010> can<00:07:20.220> see

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
culture in another video so you can see

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.340 
culture in another video so you can see
it<00:07:20.790> this<00:07:21.000> is<00:07:21.210> just<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:22.440> things<00:07:22.710> you<00:07:23.010> need<00:07:23.220> for

it this is just the things you need for

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.420 
it this is just the things you need for
bacterial<00:07:25.350> cultures<00:07:25.800> and<00:07:27.920> the<00:07:28.920> main<00:07:29.070> thing

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
bacterial cultures and the main thing

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.060 
bacterial cultures and the main thing
remember<00:07:30.420> the<00:07:30.600> main<00:07:30.750> thing<00:07:31.020> you<00:07:31.230> need<00:07:31.440> is<00:07:31.650> this
