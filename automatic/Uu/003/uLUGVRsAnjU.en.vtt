I<00:00:00.089> can't<00:00:00.510> believe<00:00:00.719> how<00:00:00.870> fast<00:00:01.110> squash<00:00:01.469> grows<00:00:01.770> at

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I can't believe how fast squash grows at

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.470 
I can't believe how fast squash grows at
the<00:00:02.010> height<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.399> summer<00:00:02.610> it<00:00:03.149> seems<00:00:03.330> like

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
the height of the summer it seems like

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.090 
the height of the summer it seems like
just<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.780> few<00:00:03.929> weeks<00:00:04.110> ago<00:00:04.259> they<00:00:04.680> were<00:00:04.710> starting

they're great in stir fries you've

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.269 
they're great in stir fries you've
probably<00:00:28.080> seen<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> grocery<00:00:29.010> stores

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279

probably seen them in the grocery stores
oh<00:00:29.550> yeah<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> farmers<00:00:30.689> market<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.109> guess

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
oh yeah or at the farmers market I guess

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.330 
oh yeah or at the farmers market I guess
I<00:00:31.349> figured<00:00:31.619> those<00:00:31.800> were<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.130> special

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I figured those were some special

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.459 
I figured those were some special
variety<00:00:32.940> though<00:00:33.090> nope<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.230> immature

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
variety though nope just little immature

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.299 
variety though nope just little immature
squashes<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> ideal<00:00:37.649> size<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
squashes so what is the ideal size for a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
squashes so what is the ideal size for a
summer<00:00:38.550> squash<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.570> want<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
summer squash well you don't want it to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
summer squash well you don't want it to
be<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> size<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> telephone<00:00:41.370> pole

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
be the size of a telephone pole

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.119 
be the size of a telephone pole
obviously<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.530> what's

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
obviously because then they get what's

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
obviously because then they get what's
your<00:00:44.309> word<00:00:44.489> or<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> oh<00:00:45.180> yeah<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.140> well

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the plant occasionally that stem will

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
the plant occasionally that stem will
split<00:01:13.020> forcing<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> harvest<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> squash

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
split forcing you to harvest the squash

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
split forcing you to harvest the squash
early<00:01:15.030> before<00:01:15.420> moisture<00:01:16.080> sneaks<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
fruit begins to rot Wow I guess it's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
fruit begins to rot Wow I guess it's
important<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> check<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.310> guys<00:01:20.520> every

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
important to check on these guys every

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.010 
important to check on these guys every
