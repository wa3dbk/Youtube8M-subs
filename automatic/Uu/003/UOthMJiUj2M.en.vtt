00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
told me of this case there was were a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.330 
told me of this case there was were a
few<00:00:47.670> issues<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.690> fixed<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.469> they

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
few issues that they fixed like they

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
thought well they heard from other
people<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.730> customers<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.899> they

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
people I think from customers that they

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
people I think from customers that they
needed<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:56.300> cable<00:00:57.300> management<00:00:57.449> books<00:00:57.809> for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
needed more cable management books for

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.439 
needed more cable management books for
example<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.710> added<00:00:59.160> those<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.239> these

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
example so they added those so these

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
example so they added those so these
would<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.050> case<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.680> course<00:01:01.770> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
would be in this case and of course here
