00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 the sting that we already know by 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.480
 lord of the rings which bilbo will convey 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.730
 skin is very rare minifigure, moreover 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.850
 shoot as it is done there is no 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.560

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.670
 by type such minifigures we head 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.680
 also closed but here at gollum mouth 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.560
