down these videos before you know I mean
so<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> construct<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.380> image<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so when I construct out an image you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
so when I construct out an image you
know<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.159> constructing<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> head<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
know I'm constructing the head as so you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.770 
know I'm constructing the head as so you
know<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> mean<00:01:10.170> using<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> format

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
know I mean using this kind of format

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
know I mean using this kind of format
you<00:01:13.070> know<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> rhythms<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> face

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you know kind of the rhythms of the face

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
you know kind of the rhythms of the face
and<00:01:15.570> stuff<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> video

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and stuff like that and I have a video

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
and stuff like that and I have a video
for<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.979> -<00:01:17.220> I'll<00:01:17.580> link<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:19.110> find<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
for this - I'll link it if I can find it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
for this - I'll link it if I can find it
I<00:01:19.710> mean<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> playlist<00:01:21.450> but

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I mean I think it's on the playlist but

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.760 
I mean I think it's on the playlist but
I'm<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.229> make<00:01:22.380> another<00:01:22.560> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
I'm gonna make another one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'm gonna make another one
-<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:25.159> rhythms<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> face<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.670> kind<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
- so rhythms of the face it's kind of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.370 
- so rhythms of the face it's kind of
like<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> construct<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> construct<00:01:28.229> out

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like when I construct it I construct out

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
like when I construct it I construct out
the<00:01:28.590> eye<00:01:28.619> socket<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.390> nose<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the eye socket the nose you know the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080 
the eye socket the nose you know the
mouth<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.280> gonna<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.850> do

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
mouth or the where it's gonna be I do

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.429 
mouth or the where it's gonna be I do
have<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.479> constructional<00:01:34.259> II<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
have very constructional II like a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.060 
have very constructional II like a
building<00:01:35.659> after<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.960> few<00:01:37.290> years<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.619> doing<00:01:37.740> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
building after a few years of doing this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
building after a few years of doing this
you<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.909> mean<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.659> got

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you know I mean it when you really got

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.420 
you know I mean it when you really got
it<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.200> brain<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it in your brain you can kind of just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.149 
it in your brain you can kind of just
start<00:01:41.820> drawing<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
start drawing it like like so that one I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
start drawing it like like so that one I
just<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.720> doodle<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.380> example

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
just kind of doodle it like for example

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.819 
just kind of doodle it like for example
that<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.189> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.520> did<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
that one I just kind of like did this

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
that one I just kind of like did this
just<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> scratched<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.329> know

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just kind of scratched it in you know

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.819 
just kind of scratched it in you know
and<00:01:52.340> very<00:01:53.340> softly<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> mean<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and very softly you know I mean I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
and very softly you know I mean I
actually<00:01:56.009> did<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> harder<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
actually did it harder they're just like

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.730 
actually did it harder they're just like
and<00:01:57.420> comment<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.750> camera<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.170> normally<00:01:58.500> it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and comment on camera but normally it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.459 
and comment on camera but normally it's
softer<00:01:59.189> than<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.990> due<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.259> there

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
softer than that it's due right there

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
softer than that it's due right there
you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> find<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:02.969> places<00:02:03.329> because

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you know you find little places because

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.969 
you know you find little places because
you<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.500> mapped<00:02:04.799> out

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you kind of have it have it mapped out

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.660 
you kind of have it have it mapped out
in<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.189> head<00:02:05.369> already

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in your head already

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.560 
in your head already
now<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> making<00:02:06.270> little

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
now you're just kind of making little

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.639 
now you're just kind of making little
landmarks<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.539> saying<00:02:09.750> very<00:02:10.050> very

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
landmarks you know I'm saying very very

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
landmarks you know I'm saying very very
gently<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:11.760> gonna<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> whole<00:02:12.150> thing

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
gently I'm not gonna do the whole thing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.580 
gently I'm not gonna do the whole thing
here<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.840> that's<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> what

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
here but that's kind of what

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
here but that's kind of what
the<00:02:13.770> result<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.400> was<00:02:14.610> right<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the result of that was right here it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750 
the result of that was right here it's
kind<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.690> did<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.959> mapped<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.709> out<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.730> can

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
kind of did this mapped it out and I can

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.490 
kind of did this mapped it out and I can
change<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.959> already<00:02:19.110> have

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
change that because you already have

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410 
change that because you already have
this<00:02:19.740> infrastructure<00:02:20.340> Academy<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.150> your<00:02:21.270> head

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
this infrastructure Academy in your head

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.580 
this infrastructure Academy in your head
it<00:02:21.569> kind<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> almost<00:02:21.959> nailed<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.350> your<00:02:22.470> head

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
it kind of almost nailed in your head

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.340 
it kind of almost nailed in your head
but<00:02:23.160> I'm<00:02:23.819> never<00:02:24.240> not<00:02:24.480> gonna<00:02:24.630> use<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.140> right

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
but I'm never not gonna use this right

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.110 
but I'm never not gonna use this right
here<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:26.040> sometimes<00:02:26.250> I'll<00:02:26.520> do<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
here because sometimes I'll do this and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
here because sometimes I'll do this and
I'm<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.660> looks<00:02:27.810> walk<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.350> why<00:02:28.500> does

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I'm like that looks walk you why does

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.750 
I'm like that looks walk you why does
that<00:02:28.709> look<00:02:28.920> wonky<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.550> I'll<00:02:29.640> go<00:02:29.730> back

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that look wonky and then I'll go back

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.750 
that look wonky and then I'll go back
and<00:02:30.270> I'll<00:02:30.600> start<00:02:30.780> thinking<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:32.430> right

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and I'll start thinking about that right

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.920 
and I'll start thinking about that right
there<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> mean<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.720> this

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
there you know I mean this this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930 
there you know I mean this this
construction<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.370> construction<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
construction so this construction is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.610 
construction so this construction is
kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> here's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> safety<00:02:36.930> net<00:02:37.080> Tampa<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
kind of here's a safety net Tampa to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.210 
kind of here's a safety net Tampa to
save<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:39.560> but<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.800> said<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.130> you're

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
save you but like I said when you're

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.410 
save you but like I said when you're
drawn<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.670> draw<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.060> sketchbook

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
drawn when I draw my sketchbook

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.610 
drawn when I draw my sketchbook
sometimes<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.870> know<00:02:42.989> like<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.230> even<00:02:43.319> showed

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
sometimes you know like I even showed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620 
sometimes you know like I even showed
you<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.010> know<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> great<00:02:45.150> example<00:02:45.270> go

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
you you know that was a great example go

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
you you know that was a great example go
to<00:02:45.660> my<00:02:45.810> sketchbook<00:02:47.720> playlist<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to my sketchbook playlist that one you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.850 
to my sketchbook playlist that one you
know<00:02:51.060> I'll<00:02:51.180> go<00:02:51.810> spin<00:02:52.019> almost<00:02:52.290> everything<00:02:52.739> I'm

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
know I'll go spin almost everything I'm

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.140 
know I'll go spin almost everything I'm
just<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.670> sure<00:02:53.700> where<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
just like I'm not sure where this is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.509 
just like I'm not sure where this is
I'll<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.140> go<00:02:55.440> sit<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.709> slowly<00:02:56.010> I'm<00:02:56.220> slowly

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
I'll just go sit and slowly I'm slowly

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.729 
I'll just go sit and slowly I'm slowly
looking<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.150> shapes<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.570> know<00:02:57.739> that's

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
looking for shapes you know that's

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.620 
looking for shapes you know that's
called<00:02:58.920> ghosting<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.489> ghosting<00:03:00.030> ghosting

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
called ghosting and ghosting ghosting

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.390 
called ghosting and ghosting ghosting
when<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.230> ghosting<00:03:01.800> basically<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.280> when

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
when like ghosting basically is when

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.030 
when like ghosting basically is when
you're<00:03:02.519> bringing<00:03:02.880> up<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> image<00:03:03.300> slowly

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
you're bringing up the image slowly

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090 
you're bringing up the image slowly
through<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.220> kind<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:06.110> almost<00:03:07.110> nonsensical

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
through this kind of almost nonsensical

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.070 
through this kind of almost nonsensical
way<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.239> kind<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.630> watching<00:03:09.810> a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
way and it's kind of like watching a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.290 
way and it's kind of like watching a
Polaroid<00:03:10.650> develop<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.090> take<00:03:12.239> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
Polaroid develop you know you take a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.660 
Polaroid develop you know you take a
Polaroid<00:03:12.630> slowly<00:03:13.319> comes<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> whole<00:03:14.459> thing

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
Polaroid slowly comes up the whole thing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.630 
Polaroid slowly comes up the whole thing
kind<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> comes<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.330> slowly<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:17.340> kind<00:03:17.610> of

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
kind of comes up slowly that's kind of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.020 
kind of comes up slowly that's kind of
the<00:03:17.730> way

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the way

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.460 
the way
ghosting<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.870> images<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.680> uh<00:03:21.200> anyways<00:03:22.200> I

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
ghosting and images but uh anyways I
