00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 hey guys i'm door and definitely eske 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 and today have many new call or 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.639
 the black swing come dairy and today 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.740
 is it a team deathmatch gamecube 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 full of tea and full of narrow crates 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.340
 I also in the match on t short as usual 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.210
 coincidence if planned but full 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 this one with 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 I started with a type 25 voice mine 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 shell vaals yesterday 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 only in the beginning it didn't really work 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 as planned it was a best 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.980
 bad and then I decided to move on 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 switch to 94 and our good choice 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.009
 because then I suddenly very good but 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 he runs beats again 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 come and then everything is for nothing 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.809
 so it's a bit of a shame 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 but level with which I am today 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 you have left is about the e3 and me 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.809
 do not know if you know is on the e3 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.129
 but the e3 is an electronics burg that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.649
 is the largest in the world is 1 time 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 per year and that is in the los in america 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 and are therefore to be precise 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 and then eat 3 stands for electr and the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.989
 thinks expo so it's a trade show 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.000
 that in the tape stuff electronics and it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.469
 and you have to think about that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 including gaming but also 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.430
 for example, new televisions new 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 cameras all kinds of new computers 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 new technology being there too 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 presented 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.890
 and it's just a big one so it is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.500
 just very important to have you there 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 to present products and it is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 therefore for Monday to Thursday 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.479
 so it started yesterday 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.549
 and yesterday have some press conferences 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 considering that the ezybox ii were one 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.700
 ubisoft 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 deal with you this video so watch as you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.880
 the same way move is likely to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 about six o'clock then there is already one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 from van playstation been alone through 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.820
 I made this video is still me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 he did not have those press conferences at 3 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.299
 o'clock at night it is a bit silly 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 egg but you have to deal with that in 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.500
 america is so that time are different so 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.780
 here way see that other one I already have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.170
 seen and the first as an xbox and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.250
 the language is that xbox 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.229
 press conference I have gameplay images 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 seen from warfare and calf telephones 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.079
 before your number vague link link 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.909
 ribbon 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.619
 I'm going to try to fire that gameplay 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.360
 upload only then I have to take a look 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.579
 until it is possible to see you there so 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.750
 some problem because it is 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.460
 so not my footage 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.650
 only yes , of course I want to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 you share so that are easy and 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.430
 and i can deal with that problem so i'm going 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.900
 see if that is hopefully possible 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.160
 that possible if it is then you have 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.500
 probably the game you put on my 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.820
 channel or level within the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.050
 first you may already have my channel 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.280
 get to see 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.500
 but we also have gameplay footage 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.820
 seen from at fund above and all around 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.090
 It was a bit unexpected 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.790
 round 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.900
 actually at every press conference and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.060
 you always get the first forest 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.230
 footage of new sale only 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.960
 in this case that you do not expect 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.700
 since today at 9 am a 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.860
 special press conference of cove that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 is so self I actually thought that is 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.400
 at i'm not seeing so will be like 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.410
 maybe a bit of a stupid sets me 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 but it was a nice surprise 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.370
 so also immediately to see image of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 the ate of swaffel and it sank in itself 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.030
 pretty good just it was 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
 really much more 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.070
 into the future will yes much more 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.080
 futuristic than I actually expected 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.190
 and if I had hoped but yes I am 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.410
 curious what we will see 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.580
 the right image will show multiplay 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.440
 will get hear of course 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.209
 interesting part will be a single player 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.500
 and lots of things in single player 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.880
 come in the multiplayer 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.250
 yes there basically makes every way 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.810
 of light even though I am sure that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.120
 that boost you started very big 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.060
 part was going to be in the game 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.130
 very much too in single player anyway 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.200
 and then something becomes something in the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.000
 multiplay just comes in 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 when full and for the rest and we what 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.840
 seen images of the new fifa one 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.580
 new with a new and xl the standard 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.900
 things that come true to your ideal 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.970
 and again i wouldn't even look 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.950
 more to mean in jointers production 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.050
 rizvi many people think i am real 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.110
 active weapon at nasa miniver case i 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.790
 played that paul 7 8 and 9 I do too 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.470
 still team I don't know for sure 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.630
 when very end of the time of so in 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.959
 Tony heard that the only difference was 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.760
 content different to minute you different 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.830
 other team of course can play study 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.480
 that change and in a different color 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.709
 from a ball or would so I loved running 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.450
 not that interesting anymore 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.280
 so this also interests me in principle 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.480
 nothing but if you like it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.700
 mark there naturally new wilder and 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.380
 just watch on youtube angelo's here too 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.030
 and for the rest we have new ones 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.549
 Mirrors Edge seen a new mass 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.320

 tonprater new se script channel 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.640
 six cows for you and horizon for them 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.070
 team and in addition likely 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.480
 new playstation titles are also only 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.459
 yes that comes is at 3 o'clock at night 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.330
 if the not yet moment that i have this video 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 make 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.840
 so fall way that's all i do 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.820
 have seen so far 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.750
 and if you want to join these three 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.820
 that is possible 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.990
 because there is a schedule for twitch and 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.800
 you can take it all the time with the twitch 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.000
 look 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.350
 I'll save that schedule in the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.200
 description put so all 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.360
 press conference at plus all times 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.290
 and then the shoes can flash you can 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960
 so go and see 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.340
 and then you can also do them at 9 o'clock 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.330
 for example your press conference for 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.560
 watch Calvetti 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.030
 And then you can see what they are 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.670
 all have it in house so that is finished 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.070
 quite interesting and name 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.930
 a level that is therefore at 9 o'clock and on the 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.120
 people watch this video right at 6 o'clock 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.770
 is the internal press conference 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.900
 if you find that interesting you can 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.100
 that also right to a look but me 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.570
 You probably won't look at it 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.250
 you the side and then look because me 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.100
 then first ice I called sit with my 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.840
 internship I now have an internship of three weeks 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.880
 and that is also reasonable of course 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.800
 go along with upload 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.390
 but when my internship is over I have 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.010
 have vacation so running try again 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.080
 fully uploaded really motivated 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.550
 but the game play is over 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 so if you just want to get three 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.750
 look in the description put a link 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.200
 to a page where your complete schedule 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.870

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.220
 view on twitch and much rest if you like 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.050
 must then pay attention you can see that 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.090
 we take in the art route and and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.040
 Maxwell sometimes want to be like that again 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.780
