let's<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.360> started<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.870> installing<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
let's get started so installing the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.230 
let's get started so installing the
lights<00:00:16.770> pretty<00:00:16.980> straightforward<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.940> comes

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
lights pretty straightforward it comes

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.810 
lights pretty straightforward it comes
with<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.810> mounting<00:00:19.260> hardware<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.859> just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
with some mounting hardware that just

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.310 
with some mounting hardware that just
bolts<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> side<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> lamp<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.199> then

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
bolts into the side of the lamp and then

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320 
bolts into the side of the lamp and then
we<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> screw<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
we have a screw going through the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.120 
we have a screw going through the
plastic<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.900> bumper<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> also

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
plastic of the bumper and then I also

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
plastic of the bumper and then I also
put<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> metal<00:00:26.670> plate<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> other<00:00:27.510> side<00:00:27.720> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
put a metal plate on the other side of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.160 
put a metal plate on the other side of
the<00:00:27.869> bumper<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:29.609> bolt<00:00:30.240> goes<00:00:30.510> through<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the bumper that the bolt goes through so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.479 
the bumper that the bolt goes through so
that's<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.500> ever<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> pull<00:00:32.219> through

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that's not ever going to pull through

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
that's not ever going to pull through
the<00:00:32.610> bumper<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.360> backside<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the bumper on the backside and the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
the bumper on the backside and the
lights<00:00:34.829> light<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.600> going

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
lights light or not that it's not going

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
lights light or not that it's not going
to<00:00:36.870> cause<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> bumper<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> sag<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.040> anything

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to cause the bumper to sag or anything

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
to cause the bumper to sag or anything
which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> nice<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> other<00:00:40.440> side<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
which is nice on the other side of this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.760 
which is nice on the other side of this
nut<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> nother<00:00:41.969> washer<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.500> locking

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
nut is a nother washer and a locking

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
nut is a nother washer and a locking
washer<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> wing<00:00:45.239> nut<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> top

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
washer and then a wing nut on the top

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
washer and then a wing nut on the top
and<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.890> keeps<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> light<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> both

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and that's what keeps the light on both

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.830 
and that's what keeps the light on both
sides<00:00:47.940> attached<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> bumper<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
sides attached to this bumper and it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.779 
sides attached to this bumper and it's
pretty<00:00:52.050> secure

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
pretty secure

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.160 
pretty secure
so<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> wiring<00:00:54.180> harness<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:54.960> pretty

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so the wiring harness is actually pretty

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.110 
so the wiring harness is actually pretty
simple<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> start<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
simple we're going to start with this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
simple we're going to start with this
end<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.109> connects<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
end right here that connects to the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.430 
end right here that connects to the
battery<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> red<00:01:00.809> cable<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> goes

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
battery we have the red cable that goes

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
battery we have the red cable that goes
to<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> positive<00:01:02.219> terminal<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> battery

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
to the positive terminal of the battery

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520 
to the positive terminal of the battery
the<00:01:03.539> black<00:01:03.809> cable<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> goes<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the black cable that goes to the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
the black cable that goes to the
negative<00:01:04.890> terminal<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> relay

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
negative terminal and this is the relay

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
negative terminal and this is the relay
this<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.560> bolt<00:01:07.860> next<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> battery

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this will just bolt next to the battery

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
this will just bolt next to the battery
on<00:01:09.030> any<00:01:09.210> bolt<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.320> find<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on any bolt that you can find and this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
on any bolt that you can find and this
is<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> fuse<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> take

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is where the fuse is you want to take

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
is where the fuse is you want to take
out<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> fuse<00:01:13.920> while<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.580> working<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
out the fuse while you're working and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.330 
out the fuse while you're working and
installing<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> lights<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> stuff<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
installing all the lights and stuff so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
installing all the lights and stuff so
that<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> fuse<00:01:18.150> doesn't<00:01:18.689> trip<00:01:19.439> itself<00:01:19.830> on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that the fuse doesn't trip itself on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
that the fuse doesn't trip itself on
accident<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.810> flip<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
accident you can just flip up that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
accident you can just flip up that
little<00:01:22.619> latch<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> fuse<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.790> now

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
little latch and the fuse comes out now

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
little latch and the fuse comes out now
the<00:01:24.780> rest<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> wiring<00:01:25.439> harness<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> kind

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the rest of the wiring harness it kind

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
the rest of the wiring harness it kind
of<00:01:26.310> splits<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.299> Y<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.630> goes<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
of splits off into a Y and goes to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
of splits off into a Y and goes to
directions<00:01:28.740> we're<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> start<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
directions we're going to start with the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
directions we're going to start with the
black<00:01:30.450> side<00:01:30.720> first<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.770> particular<00:01:32.130> wiring

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
black side first this particular wiring

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.030 
black side first this particular wiring
harness<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.570> used<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.049> two<00:01:34.290> LED<00:01:34.770> lights

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
harness can be used for two LED lights

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.450 
harness can be used for two LED lights
so<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> black<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> red<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.890> which

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so you have a black and a red here which

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
so you have a black and a red here which
connects<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.180> LED<00:01:39.570> light<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.560> black

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
connects to one LED light and a black

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
connects to one LED light and a black
and<00:01:40.950> red<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> connect<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> another

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and red there that connect to another

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.370 
and red there that connect to another
LED<00:01:42.540> light<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:42.990> since<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.320> only

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
LED light but since we're only

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
LED light but since we're only
installing<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.040> light<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.759> only<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
installing one light we're only going to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.819 
installing one light we're only going to
use<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.240> connection<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.530> we'll<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
use one connection and then we'll just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.940 
use one connection and then we'll just
electrical<00:01:47.430> tape<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> other<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> keep<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
electrical tape the other one to keep it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.330 
electrical tape the other one to keep it
keep<00:01:49.950> water<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.220> side

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
keep water off of it now the other side

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
keep water off of it now the other side
of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> wiring<00:01:54.270> harness<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of the wiring harness which is this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.399 
of the wiring harness which is this
white<00:01:55.470> cable<00:01:55.770> goes<00:01:56.670> towards<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> switch

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.950 

so<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.430> can<00:02:00.549> disconnect<00:02:01.000> here<00:02:01.390> which<00:02:01.600> makes<00:02:01.810> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
so it can disconnect here which makes it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.330 
so it can disconnect here which makes it
easier<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.289> we<00:02:02.409> go<00:02:02.530> through<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.860> firewall

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
easier when we go through the firewall

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.819 
easier when we go through the firewall
and<00:02:03.520> I'll<00:02:03.759> show<00:02:03.939> you<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:04.180> in<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.329> second<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
and I'll show you that in a second and

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.389 
and I'll show you that in a second and
then<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:08.319> switch<00:02:08.590> itself<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
then we have the switch itself and the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.309 
then we have the switch itself and the
switch<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.849> what<00:02:10.030> goes<00:02:10.269> through<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.780> firewall

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
switch is what goes through the firewall

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.320 
switch is what goes through the firewall
inside<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.069> car<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.880> will<00:02:13.060> turn<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
inside of the car and that will turn the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140 
inside of the car and that will turn the
LED<00:02:13.660> light<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.290> off<00:02:14.459> these<00:02:15.459> other<00:02:15.489> cables

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
LED light on and off these other cables

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.690 
LED light on and off these other cables
that<00:02:16.390> connect<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> switch<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.319> well<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
that connect to the switch as well this

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.250 
that connect to the switch as well this
one<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.239> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.420> screw<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.870> any<00:02:20.080> old

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
one is just going to screw on to any old

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.800 
one is just going to screw on to any old
bolt<00:02:20.650> underneath<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.700> hood<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.780> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
bolt underneath the hood and this is a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.160 
bolt underneath the hood and this is a
ground<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.910> red<00:02:25.150> cable<00:02:25.569> does<00:02:25.930> need

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
ground and then the red cable does need

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.570 
ground and then the red cable does need
to<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> positive<00:02:27.040> terminal<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
to go to the positive terminal of the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.180 
to go to the positive terminal of the
battery<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.200> did<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> test<00:02:29.739> wire<00:02:29.980> really

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
battery so I did a test wire really

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.660 
battery so I did a test wire really
quick<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.760> took<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:32.560> red<00:02:32.739> from<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> switch<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
quick I took the red from the switch and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.890 
quick I took the red from the switch and
plugged<00:02:33.940> into<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> red<00:02:34.480> terminal<00:02:34.660> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
plugged into the red terminal the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.620 
plugged into the red terminal the
battery<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> red<00:02:35.920> from<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.510> know

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
battery and the red from the you know

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.539 
battery and the red from the you know
right<00:02:37.780> next<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.110> relay<00:02:38.440> put<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> black

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
right next to the relay put the black

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.039 
right next to the relay put the black
from<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.819> relay<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> negative<00:02:40.840> right

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
from the relay on the negative right

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.309 
from the relay on the negative right
there<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:42.180> then<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.540> switch<00:02:43.810> side<00:02:44.080> just

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
there and then from the switch side just

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.420 
there and then from the switch side just
because<00:02:44.530> we're<00:02:44.650> testing<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:45.099> out<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.250> I've

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
because we're testing it out and I've

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.220 
because we're testing it out and I've
put<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.730> through<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.940> firewall<00:02:46.450> yet<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.930> took

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
put it through the firewall yet I took

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.080 
put it through the firewall yet I took
the<00:02:47.560> negative<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:48.340> grounded<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:48.910> any

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the negative and just grounded it on any

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.190 
the negative and just grounded it on any
old<00:02:49.299> bolt<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:52.090> mean<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.569> switch<00:02:52.959> right

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
old bolt and I mean the switch right

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.600 
old bolt and I mean the switch right
here<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.680> see<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> LEDs<00:02:54.340> light<00:02:54.370> up

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
here you can see that the LEDs light up

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.309 
here you can see that the LEDs light up
was<00:02:55.120> showing<00:02:55.360> us<00:02:55.480> which<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.870> getting<00:02:56.110> power

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
was showing us which is getting power

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.789 
was showing us which is getting power
and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.819> can<00:02:58.030> press<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.690> we<00:02:59.380> got<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
and then I can press it and we got the

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.509 
and then I can press it and we got the
LED<00:03:00.310> light<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.030> turns<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.569> off<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
LED light that turns on and off so the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.520 
LED light that turns on and off so the
light<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.880> connected<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:05.079> shining<00:03:05.440> it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
light is connected and I'm shining it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.650 
light is connected and I'm shining it
over<00:03:05.709> at<00:03:05.799> our<00:03:05.890> neighbor's<00:03:06.250> house<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.540> it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
over at our neighbor's house and it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.660 
over at our neighbor's house and it
lights<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.319> entire<00:03:08.350> building<00:03:09.340> all<00:03:09.579> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
lights up the entire building all the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.180 
lights up the entire building all the
way<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> top<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.390> roof<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.950> pretty

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
way to the top of the roof it's pretty

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.849 
way to the top of the roof it's pretty
intense<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.230> I'm<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.470> talk<00:03:14.560> about<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
intense so I'm going to talk about the

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.550 
intense so I'm going to talk about the
wiring<00:03:15.130> for<00:03:15.549> just<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.790> second<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.470> remember<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
wiring for just a second so remember the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.620 
wiring for just a second so remember the
center<00:03:17.799> part<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.100> harness<00:03:18.600> with<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
center part of the harness with the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.569 
center part of the harness with the
relay<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.709> two<00:03:20.920> connections<00:03:21.370> for<00:03:21.519> the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
relay and the two connections for the

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.340 
relay and the two connections for the
battery<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.299> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.900> then<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.079> wise

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
battery so this is here and then it wise

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.440 
battery so this is here and then it wise
off<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.069> we<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.519> switch<00:03:24.819> wires<00:03:25.150> that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
off and we have the switch wires that

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.640 
off and we have the switch wires that
are<00:03:25.510> just<00:03:25.660> wrapped<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:26.019> around<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.410> edge<00:03:26.530> of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
are just wrapped up around the edge of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.559 
are just wrapped up around the edge of
the<00:03:26.739> car<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.160> then<00:03:28.060> there's<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.269> hole<00:03:28.540> right

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
the car and then there's a hole right

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.460 
the car and then there's a hole right
back<00:03:29.049> in<00:03:29.230> here<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.420> metal<00:03:31.900> panel<00:03:32.319> between

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
back in here so the metal panel between

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.520 
back in here so the metal panel between
your<00:03:32.859> engine<00:03:33.250> compartment<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.450> cab<00:03:35.319> of

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
your engine compartment and the cab of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.080 
your engine compartment and the cab of
your<00:03:35.650> car<00:03:35.889> is<00:03:36.069> called<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.340> firewall<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
your car is called a firewall and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.030 
your car is called a firewall and
there's<00:03:37.780> always<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.170> hole<00:03:38.500> somewhere<00:03:38.829> in<00:03:38.980> your

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
there's always a hole somewhere in your

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.490 
there's always a hole somewhere in your
firewall<00:03:39.519> where<00:03:39.670> wires<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.329> go<00:03:40.480> through<00:03:40.780> so

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
firewall where wires can go through so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.309 
firewall where wires can go through so
there's<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.739> little<00:03:41.980> rubber<00:03:42.190> piece<00:03:43.260> right<00:03:44.260> here

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
there's a little rubber piece right here

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.379 
there's a little rubber piece right here
that<00:03:44.650> we<00:03:44.889> just<00:03:45.069> kind<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.370> push<00:03:45.579> down<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.120> then

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
that we just kind of push down and then

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.509 
that we just kind of push down and then
fed<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> wires<00:03:47.049> through<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.799> sometimes

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
fed the wires through it and sometimes

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.710 
fed the wires through it and sometimes
you<00:03:48.700> know<00:03:48.819> they're<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.150> other<00:03:49.269> side<00:03:49.569> by

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
you know they're on the other side by

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.210 
you know they're on the other side by
the<00:03:49.750> driver's<00:03:50.230> side<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.709> steering<00:03:51.040> wheel

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the driver's side or the steering wheel

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.940 
the driver's side or the steering wheel
in<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:52.239> case<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> passenger<00:03:53.290> side<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
in this case is on the passenger side so

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.319 
in this case is on the passenger side so
we<00:03:54.010> put<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> switch<00:03:54.519> wires<00:03:54.819> through<00:03:55.150> there

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
we put the switch wires through there

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.660 
we put the switch wires through there
and<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:56.650> we're<00:03:56.829> just<00:03:56.859> going<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.130> ground<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and then we're just going to ground it

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.490 
and then we're just going to ground it
off<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.540> one<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.750> these<00:03:58.840> same<00:03:59.170> silver

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
off of the one of these same silver

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.520 
off of the one of these same silver
bolts<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.609> did<00:04:00.819> before<00:04:01.319> going<00:04:02.319> back<00:04:02.500> to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
bolts that I did before going back to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.500 
bolts that I did before going back to
the<00:04:02.709> battery<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.340> second<00:04:03.730> part<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.060> Y<00:04:04.209> is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the battery the second part of the Y is

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.050 
the battery the second part of the Y is
over<00:04:04.959> here<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.889> we<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.160> one<00:04:06.459> connection<00:04:06.790> for

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
over here so we have one connection for

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.610 
over here so we have one connection for
an<00:04:07.150> LED<00:04:07.239> light<00:04:07.540> bar<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:07.989> because<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.590> a

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
an LED light bar here because this is a

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.969 
an LED light bar here because this is a
dual<00:04:08.889> harness<00:04:09.630> fed<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.840> wires<00:04:11.079> here<00:04:11.530> next<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
dual harness fed the wires here next the

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:12.960 
dual harness fed the wires here next the
radiator

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
radiator

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.240 
radiator
and<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:13.900> we're<00:04:14.050> going<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.200> take<00:04:14.470> these<00:04:14.950> wires

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
and then we're going to take these wires

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.580 
and then we're going to take these wires
and<00:04:15.700> drop<00:04:16.360> them<00:04:16.510> down<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.079> connect<00:04:17.410> them<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
and drop them down and connect them to

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.440 
and drop them down and connect them to
the<00:04:18.269> LED<00:04:19.269> light<00:04:19.510> bar<00:04:20.850> itself<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.120> it's<00:04:22.240> wires

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
the LED light bar itself and it's wires

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.420 
the LED light bar itself and it's wires
are<00:04:22.660> going<00:04:22.870> up<00:04:22.990> there<00:04:23.170> as<00:04:23.350> well<00:04:24.100> through<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
are going up there as well through the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.100 
are going up there as well through the
grille<00:04:24.670> these<00:04:25.240> are<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.480> connections<00:04:25.720> on<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
grille these are the connections on the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.690 
grille these are the connections on the
wiring<00:04:26.380> harness<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.950> are<00:04:27.040> supposed<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.310> clip

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
wiring harness that are supposed to clip

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.420

into<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:27.970> light<00:04:28.240> bar<00:04:28.510> wires<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.140> so<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.070> bought

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
into the light bar wires and so I bought

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.510 
into the light bar wires and so I bought
these<00:04:30.760> right<00:04:31.570> here<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.140> they<00:04:32.320> attach<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.190> them

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
these right here and they attach to them

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.720 
these right here and they attach to them
to<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.000> light<00:04:34.420> bar<00:04:34.690> wires<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.160> if<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.400> can<00:04:36.550> see

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
to the light bar wires so if you can see

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970 
to the light bar wires so if you can see
them<00:04:36.910> down<00:04:36.940> they're<00:04:37.450> coming<00:04:37.750> up<00:04:38.290> through<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
them down they're coming up through the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.730 
them down they're coming up through the
front<00:04:39.520> bumper<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.150> car

front bumper of the car

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.620 
front bumper of the car
they'll<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:42.010> plug<00:04:42.280> into<00:04:42.460> these<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.030> the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
they'll just plug into these and the

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.090 
they'll just plug into these and the
light<00:04:43.780> bar<00:04:43.960> will<00:04:44.110> be<00:04:44.200> connected<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
since it is coming from the passenger

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.290 
since it is coming from the passenger
side<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.350> firewall<00:04:50.670> we<00:04:51.670> just<00:04:51.820> routed<00:04:52.180> it

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
side of the firewall we just routed it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
side of the firewall we just routed it
underneath<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.580> dashboard<00:04:54.970> behind<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.080> and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
underneath the dashboard behind it and

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320 
underneath the dashboard behind it and
then<00:04:56.500> underneath<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.520> plastic<00:04:57.760> part<00:04:58.150> right

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
then underneath this plastic part right

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.180 
then underneath this plastic part right
here<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.750> now<00:04:59.500> every<00:04:59.710> time<00:04:59.770> we<00:04:59.920> can<00:05:00.160> just

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
here and now every time we can just

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.640 
here and now every time we can just
press<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.550> button<00:05:00.990> while<00:05:01.990> sitting<00:05:02.470> in<00:05:02.560> the
