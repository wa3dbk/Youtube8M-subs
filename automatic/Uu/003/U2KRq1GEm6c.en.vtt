leave about a half gallon on the bottom
to<00:01:24.600> leave<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.290> troub<00:01:25.530> behind<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.390> then<00:01:27.390> use

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to leave your troub behind and then use

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
to leave your troub behind and then use
a<00:01:28.700> standard<00:01:29.700> gas<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.420> post<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> tube<00:01:31.590> of

just piece of vinyl tube on it as your

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.179 
just piece of vinyl tube on it as your
blow-off<00:01:33.900> while<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.530> fermenting<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> let

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
blow-off while you're fermenting to let

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.510 
blow-off while you're fermenting to let
the<00:01:35.310> gas<00:01:35.460> release<00:01:37.369> obviously<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.430> you're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the gas release obviously if you're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
the gas release obviously if you're
doing<00:01:38.549> larger<00:01:39.060> batches<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> am<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:39.900> three

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
doing larger batches and I am but three

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
doing larger batches and I am but three
gallons<00:01:40.530> you'll<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> bigger<00:01:41.130> Corney<00:01:41.579> for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
gallons you'll need a bigger Corney for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
gallons you'll need a bigger Corney for
fermenting<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.840> ten<00:01:43.110> gallon

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
fermenting they do have ten gallon

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
fermenting they do have ten gallon
corney's<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> would<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:44.939> ideal

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
corney's out there that would be ideal

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.929 
corney's out there that would be ideal
for<00:01:45.530> as<00:01:46.530> fermenters<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.340> five<00:01:47.490> gallon<00:01:47.850> or

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
for as fermenters for five gallon or

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.600 
for as fermenters for five gallon or
large<00:01:48.180> even<00:01:48.390> larger<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:48.960> brewers<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
large even larger about brewers so we

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
large even larger about brewers so we

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the filter in place so the pads inside

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.080 
the filter in place so the pads inside
are<00:02:00.390> sanitized<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.950> need<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.250> push<00:02:03.060> a

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
I do set the filter down into you know

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.209 
I do set the filter down into you know
into<00:04:11.889> a<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:14.200> know<00:04:14.290> some<00:04:14.530> something<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.069> little

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.219 
into a you know some something a little

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.680 
into a you know some something a little
safety<00:04:15.430> at<00:04:15.670> just<00:04:15.849> in<00:04:15.999> case<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.329> Disney<00:04:16.660> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
safety at just in case that Disney a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.330 
safety at just in case that Disney a
little<00:04:16.840> bit<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.049> drips<00:04:17.320> I've<00:04:17.590> only<00:04:17.769> ever<00:04:17.889> seen

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
little bit of drips I've only ever seen

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.699 
little bit of drips I've only ever seen
the<00:04:18.370> my<00:04:18.880> filter<00:04:19.239> plate<00:04:19.449> drip<00:04:19.810> once<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.560> was

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
the my filter plate drip once and it was

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.159 
the my filter plate drip once and it was
very<00:04:21.160> negligible<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.030> it's<00:04:22.660> not<00:04:22.870> something

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
very negligible so it's not something

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.050 
very negligible so it's not something
you<00:04:23.259> normally<00:04:23.380> need<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.770> worry<00:04:23.949> about<00:04:24.070> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
you normally need to worry about the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.400 
you normally need to worry about the
pressure<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.570> gas<00:04:25.690> you're<00:04:26.020> pushing

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
pressure of the gas you're pushing

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.010 
pressure of the gas you're pushing
through<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:27.099> about<00:04:27.580> five<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.090> six<00:04:28.300> psi<00:04:28.840> you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
through is about five to six psi you

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.939 
through is about five to six psi you
don't<00:04:29.139> want<00:04:29.259> to<00:04:29.320> go<00:04:29.410> much<00:04:29.560> over<00:04:29.830> that

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
don't want to go much over that

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.070 
don't want to go much over that
otherwise<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.490> may<00:04:30.639> actually<00:04:30.820> start<00:04:31.240> blowing

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
otherwise you may actually start blowing

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.830 
otherwise you may actually start blowing
the<00:04:32.320> seals<00:04:32.560> on<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.190> filter<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.270> causing<00:04:34.660> some

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the seals on the filter and causing some

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.379 
the seals on the filter and causing some
leaks<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:36.220> at<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.430> point<00:04:36.669> we're<00:04:36.910> now<00:04:37.060> pushing

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
leaks so at this point we're now pushing

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.480 
leaks so at this point we're now pushing
beer<00:04:37.870> through<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.259> filter<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.650> into<00:04:39.310> our

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
beer through the filter and into our

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.050 
beer through the filter and into our

serving corny gas out of the serving

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.700 
serving corny gas out of the serving
corny<00:04:43.449> is<00:04:43.599> then<00:04:43.810> flowing<00:04:44.259> out<00:04:44.349> of<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.560> gas

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
corny is then flowing out of the gas

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.900 
corny is then flowing out of the gas

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.029 
post e'en into the bucket fast forward
here<00:04:48.940> about<00:04:49.270> thirty<00:04:49.720> minutes<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:50.949> you

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.529 
here about thirty minutes and if you
look<00:04:51.190> closely<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.759> will<00:04:51.880> see<00:04:51.940> liquid

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
look closely you will see liquid

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.719 
look closely you will see liquid
starting<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.169> come<00:04:53.380> out<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.889> gas<00:04:54.039> post<00:04:54.460> so

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
starting to come out of the gas post so

corney's<00:05:52.460> for<00:05:52.639> fermenters<00:05:53.090> is<00:05:53.270> they're<00:05:53.810> so

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
corney's for fermenters is they're so
