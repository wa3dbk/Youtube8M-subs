00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
guys it really is the first quarter

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.080 
guys it really is the first quarter
that's<00:02:53.930> let<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.500> magic<00:02:54.859> down<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.340> margin<00:02:55.970> is

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
that's let the magic down the margin is

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.449 
that's let the magic down the margin is
now<00:02:56.269> nine<00:02:56.540> they<00:02:57.290> were<00:02:57.349> down<00:02:57.590> by<00:02:57.620> seven<00:02:58.159> at

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
now nine they were down by seven at

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.729 
now nine they were down by seven at
quarter<00:02:58.849> time<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.390> they've<00:02:59.750> been<00:02:59.989> really<00:03:00.230> in

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
quarter time so they've been really in

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.589 
quarter time so they've been really in
this<00:03:00.920> little-ass<00:03:01.280> hurry<00:03:01.549> Thomas<00:03:01.819> but<00:03:02.090> just

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
this little-ass hurry Thomas but just

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.379 
this little-ass hurry Thomas but just
goes<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.930> show<00:03:03.109> what<00:03:03.409> a<00:03:03.829> good<00:03:04.010> start<00:03:04.430> does<00:03:04.609> does

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
goes to show what a good start does does

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.869 
goes to show what a good start does does
particular<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.049> fire<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> old<00:03:07.609> saying

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
particular in a fire is that old saying

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.099 
particular in a fire is that old saying
you<00:03:08.000> can't<00:03:08.269> leave<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.510> game<00:03:08.689> in<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.930> first

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
you can't leave the game in the first

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.599 
you can't leave the game in the first
quarter<00:03:09.379> but<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.859> certainly<00:03:10.159> lose<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
quarter but you can certainly lose it

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.190 
quarter but you can certainly lose it
and<00:03:10.879> I<00:03:11.000> think<00:03:11.060> magic<00:03:11.569> will<00:03:11.689> look<00:03:11.810> back<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.109> that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and I think magic will look back at that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.449 
and I think magic will look back at that
first<00:03:12.470> quarter<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:12.889> wish<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.159> was<00:03:13.280> different

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
first quarter and wish it was different

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.940 
first quarter and wish it was different
but<00:03:13.849> one<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.019> reasons<00:03:15.409> that<00:03:15.439> happened<00:03:15.889> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
but one of the reasons that happened I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.349 
but one of the reasons that happened I
think<00:03:15.980> was<00:03:16.250> because<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.669> Thunderbirds<00:03:17.180> which

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
think was because the Thunderbirds which

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.360 
think was because the Thunderbirds which
is<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.720> had<00:03:18.139> such<00:03:18.319> intensity<00:03:18.829> right<00:03:19.069> from<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
is so had such intensity right from the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.009 
is so had such intensity right from the
start<00:03:19.579> they<00:03:19.819> know<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.239> if<00:03:20.329> we<00:03:20.450> need<00:03:20.659> to<00:03:20.870> win<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
start they know what if we need to win a

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.390 
start they know what if we need to win a
grand<00:03:21.290> final

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.809 

and<00:03:27.670> still

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
and still

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.850 
and still
get<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.660> hold<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.050> umpires<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.620> every

get to hold the umpires on every
decision<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.430> felt<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> was<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> little<00:03:33.120> Oh

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330
