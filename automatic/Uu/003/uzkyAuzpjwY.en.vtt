252 foot-pounds of torque it is not the
same<00:00:14.790> engine<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.480> pilot<00:00:15.900> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
same engine that's in a pilot this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
same engine that's in a pilot this
transmission<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:16.980> also<00:00:17.310> specifically

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
transmission was also specifically

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.720 
transmission was also specifically
developed<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.600> vehicle<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.699> again<00:00:20.699> a

developed for this vehicle it's again a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
developed for this vehicle it's again a
vehicle<00:00:21.180> designed<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> tilt<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> work<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
vehicle designed to tilt and work as a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
vehicle designed to tilt and work as a
truck<00:00:22.980> from<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> ground<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.789> part<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
truck from the ground up part of one of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.730 
truck from the ground up part of one of
the<00:00:24.630> other<00:00:24.750> features<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.260> try<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> incorporate

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the other features we try to incorporate

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740 
the other features we try to incorporate
this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> communicate<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.180> strong<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
this is to communicate a very strong and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
this is to communicate a very strong and
powerful<00:00:27.930> emotional<00:00:28.650> sound<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> customer

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
powerful emotional sound of the customer

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
powerful emotional sound of the customer
so<00:00:29.910> we've<00:00:30.029> tuned<00:00:30.269> both<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> intake<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so we've tuned both the intake and the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
so we've tuned both the intake and the
exhaust<00:00:31.560> system<00:00:32.130> provide<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:33.510> sound<00:00:33.870> output

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
exhaust system provide good sound output

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.709 
exhaust system provide good sound output
during<00:00:34.590> launch<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.489> only<00:00:35.790> inside<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> cabin

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
during launch not only inside the cabin

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
during launch not only inside the cabin
but<00:00:36.870> outside<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> cabin<00:00:37.860> you'll<00:00:38.010> find<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but outside the cabin you'll find a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770 
but outside the cabin you'll find a
little<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:38.700> different<00:00:39.000> character<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little bit different character with this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
little bit different character with this
vehicle<00:00:40.290> compared<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> pilot<00:00:41.610> MDX<00:00:42.090> you'll

vehicle compared to the pilot MDX you'll

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000 
vehicle compared to the pilot MDX you'll
get<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:43.020> bit<00:00:43.110> more<00:00:43.290> emotional<00:00:43.530> sound

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
get a little bit more emotional sound

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
get a little bit more emotional sound
and<00:00:44.219> feedback<00:00:44.640> providing<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> sensation

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and feedback providing you sensation

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.389 
and feedback providing you sensation
that<00:00:46.320> you're<00:00:46.469> actually<00:00:46.620> using<00:00:46.829> and

that you're actually using and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.770 
that you're actually using and
developing<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.910> torque<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> we've<00:00:48.570> worked

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
developing that torque that we've worked

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
developing that torque that we've worked
so<00:00:48.870> hard<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.230> create<00:00:49.410> during<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.579> launch

is<00:01:12.960> we've<00:01:13.409> incorporated<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.189> switch<00:01:14.460> valve<00:01:14.729> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
is we've incorporated a switch valve in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.590 
is we've incorporated a switch valve in
the<00:01:15.090> intake<00:01:15.450> manifold<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.220> 4200<00:01:18.180> rpm
