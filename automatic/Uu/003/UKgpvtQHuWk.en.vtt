00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
difficult but if we look at the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.090 
difficult but if we look at the
prevailing<00:00:34.230> wind<00:00:34.440> condition<00:00:34.890> at<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> moment

the rest of this week it will get quite
strong<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> time<00:00:40.620> Wednesday<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
strong I think for a time Wednesday and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.709 
strong I think for a time Wednesday and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
day weather-wise we've had a lot of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
day weather-wise we've had a lot of
mister<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> said<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.100> beginning<00:01:11.250> to

break up now I think for many it will be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
break up now I think for many it will be
a<00:01:13.740> dry<00:01:14.100> afternoon<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.270> sunshine<00:01:15.509> but

em today then around 5 to 7 degrees
certainly<00:01:25.259> feeling<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> bit<00:01:25.740> chilly<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.159> you're

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
certainly feeling a bit chilly if you're

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
certainly feeling a bit chilly if you're
out<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.869> head<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.200> tonight

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
out and about as we head through tonight

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
out and about as we head through tonight
the<00:01:28.650> weather<00:01:28.799> front<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.220> Atlantic<00:01:29.670> starts

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the weather front from Atlantic starts

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
the weather front from Atlantic starts
heading<00:01:30.270> its<00:01:30.509> way<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.500> slow<00:01:31.920> progress

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
heading its way in very slow progress

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
heading its way in very slow progress
eastwards<00:01:32.790> though<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.570> means<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> will

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
eastwards though and that means it will

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
eastwards though and that means it will
still<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> western<00:01:35.130> side<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> United

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
still be down the western side of United

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.210 
still be down the western side of United
Kingdom<00:01:36.299> by<00:01:36.570> Dawn<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.619> zoom<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
Kingdom by Dawn if we zoom in on that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
Kingdom by Dawn if we zoom in on that
you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.820> high<00:01:39.000> pressure<00:01:39.299> then

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you can see that high pressure then

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
you can see that high pressure then
remains<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> dominant<00:01:40.560> feature<00:01:40.799> tonight<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
remains the dominant feature tonight and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
remains the dominant feature tonight and
that<00:01:41.790> means<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.240> turn<00:01:42.540> foggy<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.200> also

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that means it will turn foggy and also

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.800 
that means it will turn foggy and also
frosty<00:01:44.189> once<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:45.270> temperatures<00:01:45.630> down

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
frosty once more with temperatures down

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.920 
frosty once more with temperatures down
as<00:01:46.049> low<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.350> minus<00:01:46.380> 2<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.369> minus<00:01:47.549> 3<00:01:48.119> after<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
as low as minus 2 to minus 3 after the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
as low as minus 2 to minus 3 after the
West<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> cloud<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> rain<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
West is the cloud in the rain and the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.620 
West is the cloud in the rain and the
wind<00:01:50.369> picks<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.939> though<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.390> think

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
wind picks up though I think

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.200 
wind picks up though I think
temperatures<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.320> around<00:01:52.380> +2<00:01:53.100> 2<00:01:53.460> plus<00:01:53.820> 3

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
temperatures will be around +2 2 plus 3

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
temperatures will be around +2 2 plus 3
as<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.079> head<00:01:55.229> through<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> tomorrow<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.040> it's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
as we head through to tomorrow then it's

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
as we head through to tomorrow then it's
certainly<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.060> slow

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
certainly going to be a very slow

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270 
certainly going to be a very slow
progress<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.049> weather<00:01:58.469> front<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
progress this weather front and that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280 
progress this weather front and that
means<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.759> many<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> will<00:02:00.149> start<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.630> dry<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
means for many it will start off dry and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
means for many it will start off dry and
bright<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> frosty<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> eastern<00:02:02.729> side

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bright and frosty on the eastern side

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.910 
bright and frosty on the eastern side
after<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.810> West<00:02:04.110> though<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.770> will

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
after the West though I think we will

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.530 
after the West though I think we will
find<00:02:04.950> some<00:02:05.369> snow<00:02:05.640> over<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> higher<00:02:06.240> ground

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
find some snow over the higher ground

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
find some snow over the higher ground
particularly<00:02:06.869> perhaps<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.439> Cumbria<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> up

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
particularly perhaps in Cumbria and up

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
particularly perhaps in Cumbria and up
into<00:02:08.700> Southwest<00:02:09.239> Scotland<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.319> progress

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
into Southwest Scotland that progress

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.920 
into Southwest Scotland that progress
only<00:02:11.039> very<00:02:11.400> slowly<00:02:11.849> eastwards<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:12.810> we

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
only very slowly eastwards then as we

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.700 
only very slowly eastwards then as we
head<00:02:13.080> through<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.379> earth

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
head through the earth

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
head through the earth
and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.400> think<00:02:14.610> Northeast<00:02:15.090> Scotland<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and I think Northeast Scotland in the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.170 
and I think Northeast Scotland in the
northwest<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.560> stay<00:02:16.830> dry<00:02:17.130> until<00:02:17.340> after<00:02:18.000> dark

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
northwest will stay dry until after dark

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.060 
northwest will stay dry until after dark
into<00:02:18.960> Wednesday<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.500> where<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> front<00:02:19.950> on

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
into Wednesday one where the front on

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.990 
into Wednesday one where the front on
the<00:02:20.160> eastern<00:02:20.430> side<00:02:20.610> another<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.510> coming<00:02:21.900> in
