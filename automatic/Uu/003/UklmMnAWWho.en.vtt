essential<00:00:54.739> why<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> built<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> reactor<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
essential why I built the reactor is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
essential why I built the reactor is
because<00:00:57.390> warthogs<00:00:57.870> can't<00:00:58.140> tak<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.190> RAM

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because warthogs can't tak like in RAM

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
because warthogs can't tak like in RAM
but<00:00:59.969> against<00:01:00.270> buildings<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.680> very

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
but against buildings that's not very

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.490 
but against buildings that's not very
useful<00:01:03.589> they<00:01:04.589> can't<00:01:04.860> attack<00:01:04.979> until<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:06.210> get

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
useful they can't attack until they get

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.030 
useful they can't attack until they get
visibility<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.840> gunner<00:01:09.840> ability<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.830> adds

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
visibility the gunner ability which adds

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it's not the most intelligent thing but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.720 
it's not the most intelligent thing but
it<00:02:10.230> can<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.860> damage<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.700> well

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.860 
it can do a lot of damage to you as well
and<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.380> puts<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.620> at<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.770> stalemate

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
and that kind of puts you at a stalemate

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.940 
and that kind of puts you at a stalemate
usually<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:15.990> opponent<00:02:16.380> will<00:02:16.470> try<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> deal

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
usually your opponent will try to deal

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.020 
usually your opponent will try to deal
with<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.600> okay<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:19.320> here<00:02:19.670> my<00:02:20.670> opponent

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
with you okay so right here my opponent

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.840 
with you okay so right here my opponent
is<00:02:21.120> building<00:02:21.450> another<00:02:21.720> warehouse<00:02:22.670> while<00:02:23.670> it's

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
is building another warehouse while it's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.330 
is building another warehouse while it's
getting<00:02:24.120> built<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.380> warehouses<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.070> almost

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
getting built the warehouses have almost

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.210 
getting built the warehouses have almost
no<00:02:26.700> help<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.290> beneficial<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
no help so it's a very beneficial to you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
no help so it's a very beneficial to you
to<00:02:29.400> target<00:02:29.820> them<00:02:30.000> while<00:02:30.360> they're<00:02:30.600> being<00:02:30.750> built

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to target them while they're being built

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.810 
to target them while they're being built
see<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.680> already<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.070> half<00:02:33.250> health<00:02:33.430> I've

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
see it's already at half health I've

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.810 
see it's already at half health I've
spent<00:02:34.120> 110<00:02:34.960> second<00:02:35.380> shooting<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.740> it<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.520> an

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
spent 110 second shooting in it it's an

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.200 
spent 110 second shooting in it it's an
excellent<00:02:37.150> way

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.630 

destroy<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.530> good<00:02:41.890> bit<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.250> structure

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
destroy a good bit of the structure

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.130 
destroy a good bit of the structure
because<00:02:43.090> when<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.330> comes<00:02:43.480> back<00:02:43.600> into<00:02:43.900> play

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
because when it comes back into play

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.470 
because when it comes back into play
it's<00:02:44.800> had<00:02:45.400> about<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> fifth<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> its<00:02:46.210> health

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's had about a fifth of its health

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.600 
it's had about a fifth of its health
food<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.470> that'll<00:02:47.800> let<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.010> destroy<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
food and that'll let you destroy that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.210 
food and that'll let you destroy that
warehouse<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:49.330> lot<00:02:49.660> more<00:02:49.840> fit

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.430 

pretty<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.060> recommend<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> destroy

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
pretty now I recommend that you destroy

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.140 
pretty now I recommend that you destroy
all<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.830> warehouses<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.460> soon<00:02:56.610> as<00:02:56.700> possible

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
all the warehouses as soon as possible

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.090 
all the warehouses as soon as possible
because<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.870> even<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.440> they<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.980> nuh

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
because if even if they have you nuh

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.560 
because if even if they have you nuh
producing<00:02:59.460> buildings<00:02:59.850> they<00:03:00.270> won't<00:03:00.450> have

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
producing buildings they won't have

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.450 
producing buildings they won't have
resources<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.740> then<00:03:01.860> they'll<00:03:02.010> produce<00:03:02.190> these

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
resources so then they'll produce these

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.310 
resources so then they'll produce these
units<00:03:02.850> they'll<00:03:03.390> come<00:03:03.540> after<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.930> share<00:03:04.170> your

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
units they'll come after you share your

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.620 
units they'll come after you share your
dog<00:03:04.620> probably<00:03:04.950> die<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:05.880> they'll<00:03:06.150> take<00:03:06.390> damage

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
dog probably die but they'll take damage

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.090 
dog probably die but they'll take damage
and<00:03:06.990> those<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.170> all<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.620> units<00:03:07.920> they'll

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and those are all the units they'll

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.810 
and those are all the units they'll
began<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:09.030> have<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:10.310> they'll<00:03:11.310> need<00:03:11.580> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
began that they have and they'll need to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.270 
began that they have and they'll need to
invest<00:03:12.240> more<00:03:12.450> money<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.930> produce<00:03:13.050> more<00:03:13.290> ads<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
invest more money to produce more ads so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
invest more money to produce more ads so
if<00:03:14.430> they<00:03:14.550> waste<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> money<00:03:15.360> on<00:03:15.450> units

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
if they waste all the money on units

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.540 
if they waste all the money on units
trying<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.140> destroy<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.400> can

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
trying to destroy you then that can

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.920 
trying to destroy you then that can
potentially<00:03:17.670> screw<00:03:18.210> them<00:03:18.390> over<00:03:18.480> entirely

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
potentially screw them over entirely

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.300 
potentially screw them over entirely
because<00:03:19.500> they<00:03:19.740> won't<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:20.010> able<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> make

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
because they won't be able to make

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.000 
because they won't be able to make
warehouses<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:22.320> an<00:03:22.440> excellent<00:03:22.710> strategy

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
warehouses it's an excellent strategy

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.720 
warehouses it's an excellent strategy
and<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:26.330> seriously<00:03:27.330> recommend<00:03:27.600> then<00:03:28.730> destroy

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and I seriously recommend then destroy

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.870 
and I seriously recommend then destroy
the<00:03:29.880> warehouses<00:03:30.410> I'm<00:03:31.410> not<00:03:31.650> entirely<00:03:31.950> sure<00:03:32.130> why

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the warehouses I'm not entirely sure why

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.340 
the warehouses I'm not entirely sure why
attack<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.360> hall<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.780> probably<00:03:34.200> because

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
attack this hall it was probably because

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.610 
attack this hall it was probably because
it<00:03:34.560> was<00:03:34.590> being<00:03:34.800> built<00:03:34.890> at<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.280> time

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.750 

but<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.740> should<00:03:39.770> always<00:03:40.130> go<00:03:40.580> for<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
but you should always go for the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.080 
but you should always go for the
warehouses<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:43.300> if<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.900> notice<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.470> haven't

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
warehouses so if you notice I haven't

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.340 
warehouses so if you notice I haven't
started<00:03:47.090> making<00:03:47.390> more<00:03:47.569> reactors<00:03:47.930> or<00:03:48.110> anything

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
started making more reactors or anything

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.330 
started making more reactors or anything
else<00:03:50.290> reason<00:03:51.290> for<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:53.770> I've<00:03:54.770> made<00:03:55.070> a

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
else reason for that is I've made a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.940 
else reason for that is I've made a
reactor<00:03:56.000> I'm<00:03:56.959> not<00:03:57.110> upgrading<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:57.830> what<00:03:57.920> I

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
reactor I'm not upgrading it's what I

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.760 
reactor I'm not upgrading it's what I
mean<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.720> reason<00:03:59.750> that<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.260> don't<00:04:00.530> upgrade

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
mean the reason that you don't upgrade

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.350 
mean the reason that you don't upgrade
is<00:04:01.310> because<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.700> don't<00:04:01.880> get<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.120> minerals

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
is because you don't get the minerals

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.590 
is because you don't get the minerals
fence<00:04:04.360> not<00:04:05.360> minerals<00:04:05.780> uh<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.590> don't<00:04:06.680> get<00:04:06.920> your

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
fence not minerals uh you don't get your

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.240 
fence not minerals uh you don't get your
gonna<00:04:08.600> do<00:04:08.810> your<00:04:08.989> resources<00:04:09.590> pencil<00:04:09.950> so

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
gonna do your resources pencil so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.680 
gonna do your resources pencil so
there's<00:04:10.400> no<00:04:10.459> point<00:04:10.820> upgrading<00:04:11.600> your<00:04:13.690> reactors

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
there's no point upgrading your reactors

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.650 
there's no point upgrading your reactors
you<00:04:15.320> might<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:15.680> well<00:04:15.920> buy<00:04:16.910> three<00:04:17.359> reactors

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
you might as well buy three reactors

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.500 
you might as well buy three reactors
it'll<00:04:18.380> actually<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.709> feted<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.880> opposed<00:04:20.239> to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
it'll actually be feted as opposed to

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.170 
it'll actually be feted as opposed to
upgrading

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
upgrading

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.920 
upgrading
waiting<00:04:22.900> for<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.199> those<00:04:23.590> resources<00:04:24.930> five

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
waiting for that those resources five

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
be able to rush effective so a couple of

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.420 
be able to rush effective so a couple of
turrets<00:05:02.270> usually<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.259> actually<00:05:03.650> enough<00:05:04.039> to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
turrets usually is actually enough to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.570 
turrets usually is actually enough to
summon<00:05:04.849> rush<00:05:05.210> 4th<00:05:05.629> Act

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.240 

now<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.360> I've<00:05:10.449> got<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.629> Grenadier<00:05:11.250> randhir

now that I've got the Grenadier randhir

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.700 
now that I've got the Grenadier randhir
significantly<00:05:13.150> improves<00:05:13.659> how<00:05:14.080> fast<00:05:14.470> you

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
significantly improves how fast you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.529 
significantly improves how fast you
destroyed<00:05:15.189> buildings<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:17.169> actually<00:05:17.319> a<00:05:18.539> very

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
destroyed buildings it's actually a very

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.740 
destroyed buildings it's actually a very
significant<00:05:20.409> amount<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:21.310> also<00:05:22.180> produce<00:05:22.539> a

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
significant amount I also produce a

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.059 
significant amount I also produce a
couple<00:05:23.020> more<00:05:23.139> boxes<00:05:23.289> we<00:05:23.590> move<00:05:23.740> from<00:05:23.830> there

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
couple more boxes we move from there

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.330 
couple more boxes we move from there
it's<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.180> very<00:05:25.419> effective<00:05:25.689> strategy<00:05:26.289> just<00:05:27.129> in

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
it's a very effective strategy just in

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.339 
it's a very effective strategy just in
case<00:05:27.580> they<00:05:28.300> bring<00:05:28.539> something<00:05:28.960> other<00:05:29.169> than<00:05:29.289> a

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
case they bring something other than a

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.890 
case they bring something other than a
profit<00:05:30.120> usually<00:05:31.120> an<00:05:31.210> apartment<00:05:31.659> right<00:05:31.750> of

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
profit usually an apartment right of

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.990 
profit usually an apartment right of
profit<00:05:32.530> you<00:05:33.310> write<00:05:33.729> usually<00:05:34.719> earlier<00:05:35.819> but<00:05:36.819> if

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
profit you write usually earlier but if

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.950 
profit you write usually earlier but if
they're<00:05:37.150> getting<00:05:37.360> desperate<00:05:37.449> like<00:05:37.840> they

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
they're getting desperate like they

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.290 
they're getting desperate like they
would<00:05:38.199> be<00:05:38.259> now<00:05:38.560> they<00:05:39.430> will<00:05:39.610> be<00:05:39.729> designing<00:05:40.150> a

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
you make that reactor and you just let

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.330

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.000 
and I would be afraid in my phone inside
but<00:07:16.960> luckily<00:07:17.170> they're<00:07:17.470> leaving<00:07:17.740> me<00:07:17.830> alone

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 
faster than gaining that large amount of

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.930 
faster than gaining that large amount of
resources<00:07:41.440> as<00:07:41.620> you<00:07:42.010> see<00:07:42.160> i<00:07:42.190> destroyed<00:07:42.700> one<00:07:42.910> of
