00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hello today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.940 
hello today I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> USB<00:00:02.490> floppy<00:00:03.060> disk<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.870> an<00:00:04.140> iPad<00:00:04.529> so

use a USB floppy disk and an iPad so

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.120 
use a USB floppy disk and an iPad so
I've<00:00:05.759> gone<00:00:05.970> at<00:00:06.150> an<00:00:06.299> old<00:00:06.450> USB<00:00:06.870> floppy<00:00:07.410> disk<00:00:07.740> here

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I've gone at an old USB floppy disk here

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.320 
I've gone at an old USB floppy disk here
and<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:08.790> iPad<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.620> I<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.830> Apple's<00:00:11.429> camera

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
and my iPad and I have Apple's camera

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.400 
and my iPad and I have Apple's camera
connector<00:00:12.719> kit<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.370> now<00:00:15.139> I've<00:00:16.139> done<00:00:16.289> some

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
connector kit for it now I've done some

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.930 
connector kit for it now I've done some
research<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.160> people<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.789> have

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
research and people that have

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.230 
research and people that have
successfully<00:00:18.690> used<00:00:19.070> USB<00:00:20.070> flash<00:00:20.310> drives<00:00:20.699> with

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
successfully used USB flash drives with

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.599 
successfully used USB flash drives with
the<00:00:21.270> camera<00:00:22.260> connector<00:00:22.680> kick<00:00:22.890> by<00:00:23.189> basically

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the camera connector kick by basically

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.689 
the camera connector kick by basically
faking<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.189> making<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.279> appear<00:00:26.580> like

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
faking it out and making it appear like

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
faking it out and making it appear like
it's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> camera<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.840> pretty<00:00:27.990> easy<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> do

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it's a camera and it's pretty easy to do

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
it's a camera and it's pretty easy to do
you<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.769> format<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.840> USB<00:00:30.840> flash<00:00:31.349> drive<00:00:31.969> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you just format your USB flash drive in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.100 
you just format your USB flash drive in
DOS<00:00:33.570> format<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.710> put<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> folder<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.460> call

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
DOS format you put a folder on a call

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
DOS format you put a folder on a call
DCIM<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.530> capital<00:00:38.040> letters<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.730> put

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
DCIM all capital letters and you put

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.500 
DCIM all capital letters and you put
your<00:00:39.000> photos<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> DCIM<00:00:40.739> folder<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> trick

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
your photos in the DCIM folder the trick

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
your photos in the DCIM folder the trick
is<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.230> eight<00:00:43.559> characters<00:00:44.129> long

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
is they have to be eight characters long

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
is they have to be eight characters long
not<00:00:45.120> counting<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.629> extension<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.620> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
not counting the extension so it's like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.350 
not counting the extension so it's like
the<00:00:46.860> old<00:00:46.890> DOS<00:00:47.309> days<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.969> has<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> be

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the old DOS days and it has to be

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
the old DOS days and it has to be
exactly<00:00:49.020> eight<00:00:49.260> characters<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> can't<00:00:50.219> be

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
exactly eight characters it can't be

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
exactly eight characters it can't be
just<00:00:50.910> less<00:00:51.210> than<00:00:51.239> eight<00:00:51.539> characters<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
just less than eight characters that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.299 
just less than eight characters that
they<00:00:52.289> actually<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.070> eight

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
they actually have to be eight

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
they actually have to be eight
characters<00:00:53.340> long<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.469> works<00:00:55.620> pretty

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
characters long so that works pretty

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.910 
characters long so that works pretty
good<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.489> most<00:00:56.640> flash<00:00:57.180> drives<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.870> draw<00:00:58.859> too

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
good and most flash drives you draw too

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.849 
good and most flash drives you draw too
much<00:00:59.100> power<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> run<00:01:00.180> through<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
much power so you have to run through a

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.590 
much power so you have to run through a
powered<00:01:01.859> hub<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> work<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
powered hub to get them to work but I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
powered hub to get them to work but I
wondered<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> same<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.369> work<00:01:05.400> on

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
wondered if the same thing would work on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
wondered if the same thing would work on
a<00:01:05.880> USB<00:01:06.270> floppy<00:01:06.720> drive<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.890> let's<00:01:08.130> take<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a USB floppy drive and so let's take a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
a USB floppy drive and so let's take a
look<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.900> now<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> floppy<00:01:11.010> disk

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
look right now I have the floppy disk

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
look right now I have the floppy disk
found<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.479> desktop<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.650> have

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
found it on my desktop and I have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
found it on my desktop and I have
created<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.200> DCIM<00:01:16.200> folder<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.270> three

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
created the DCIM folder and I have three

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.700 
created the DCIM folder and I have three
photos<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:21.259> eight<00:01:22.259> digits

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
photos in there all with eight digits

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.390 
photos in there all with eight digits
exactly<00:01:23.220> plus<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> extension<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:25.189> this<00:01:26.189> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
exactly plus the extension and this one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330 
exactly plus the extension and this one
right<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.829> extension

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
right here actually has the extension

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
right here actually has the extension
it's<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.759> hidden<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:33.110> turn<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.140> off<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's just hidden so turn that off so it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.609 
it's just hidden so turn that off so it
looks<00:01:35.400> uniform

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.660 

so<00:01:39.280> okay<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:40.030> there<00:01:40.390> are<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.689> three<00:01:40.869> photos<00:01:41.259> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so okay so there are the three photos so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.560 
so okay so there are the three photos so
let's<00:01:42.670> see<00:01:42.850> if<00:01:42.939> this<00:01:43.090> works

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
let's see if this works

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.840 
let's see if this works
you<00:01:44.439> could<00:01:44.560> actually<00:01:44.740> use<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.130> floppy<00:01:45.520> disk

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
you could actually use a floppy disk

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:58.300 
you could actually use a floppy disk
with<00:01:46.179> an<00:01:46.840> iPad<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.289> we<00:01:47.799> will<00:01:48.039> eject

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.200 

and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.910> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> take<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.810> USB<00:02:01.560> cord

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and then I'm going to take the USB cord

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.810 
and then I'm going to take the USB cord
plug<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.360> into<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:04.620> hub<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.520> we'll<00:02:08.670> go

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
plug it into the hub and then we'll go

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:17.090 
plug it into the hub and then we'll go
over<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.210> iPad<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.970> fire<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:16.100> we

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
over to the iPad and fire it up and we

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.610 
over to the iPad and fire it up and we
will<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.430> ahead<00:02:17.490> then<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.620> floppy

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
will go ahead then and put the floppy

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:34.800 
will go ahead then and put the floppy
disk<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.740> let's<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.520> happens

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.949 

there<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.930> goes

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:54.870 

and<00:02:42.769> will<00:02:42.920> cache<00:02:43.219> these<00:02:43.549> three<00:02:43.819> pictures

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.150 

not<00:02:55.880> nearly<00:02:56.240> as<00:02:56.480> fast<00:02:56.810> as<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> flash<00:02:57.530> drive<00:02:57.740> by

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
not nearly as fast as a flash drive by

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.460 
not nearly as fast as a flash drive by
any<00:02:58.370> stretch<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.790> imagination<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.600> fully

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
any stretch of the imagination but fully

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.240 
any stretch of the imagination but fully
functional<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:01.940> get<00:03:02.180> down<00:03:02.420> here<00:03:02.630> we<00:03:02.810> can

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
functional and so get down here we can

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:14.270 
functional and so get down here we can
of<00:03:04.250> course<00:03:05.140> say<00:03:06.140> import<00:03:06.500> all

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.180 

and<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.120> it'll<00:03:15.360> ask<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.110> want<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.620> delete

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
and then it'll ask if we want to delete

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.370 
and then it'll ask if we want to delete
the<00:03:18.260> photos<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.440> floppy<00:03:19.710> disks<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.160> yep

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
the photos on the floppy disks and yep

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.340 
the photos on the floppy disks and yep
and<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.560> will<00:03:22.740> erase<00:03:22.980> them<00:03:23.310> from<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:24.690> disk<00:03:24.930> so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
and it will erase them from the disk so

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.170 
and it will erase them from the disk so
you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.460> indeed<00:03:26.730> use<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.150> floppy<00:03:27.690> disk<00:03:27.990> with<00:03:28.260> a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
you can indeed use a floppy disk with a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.080 
you can indeed use a floppy disk with a
iPad<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.950> no<00:03:31.950> jailbreaking<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.730> hacks<00:03:32.910> or

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
iPad with no jailbreaking or hacks or

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.699 
iPad with no jailbreaking or hacks or
anything<00:03:33.240> like<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.930> pretty<00:03:34.230> cool<00:03:34.470> just

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
anything like that so pretty cool just

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.330 
anything like that so pretty cool just
thought<00:03:34.890> I'd<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.100> video<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:35.610> by
