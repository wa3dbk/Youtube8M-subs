through walls and actually you know get

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.499 
through walls and actually you know get
a<00:01:03.770> look<00:01:04.009> where<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.369> people<00:01:04.549> actually<00:01:05.089> are<00:01:05.119> I

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
a look where the people actually are I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.319 
a look where the people actually are I
mean<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.500> game<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.950> full<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.549> tons<00:01:08.179> of

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
mean this game is full of tons of

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.730 
mean this game is full of tons of
different<00:01:08.479> things<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.109> I<00:01:09.200> honestly<00:01:09.529> think

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
different things and I honestly think

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.649 
different things and I honestly think
that<00:01:09.829> the<00:01:09.979> graphics<00:01:10.429> look<00:01:11.179> a<00:01:11.329> little<00:01:11.479> bit

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
that the graphics look a little bit

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.749 
that the graphics look a little bit
better<00:01:11.779> than<00:01:12.109> call<00:01:12.859> of<00:01:12.889> duty<00:01:13.130> black<00:01:13.249> ops<00:01:13.520> 1

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
better than call of duty black ops 1

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.389 
better than call of duty black ops 1
there's<00:01:14.179> definitely<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.689> big<00:01:15.079> step<00:01:15.399> compared

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's definitely a big step compared

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.830 
there's definitely a big step compared
to<00:01:16.490> black<00:01:16.909> ops<00:01:17.270> 1<00:01:18.159> now<00:01:19.299> further<00:01:20.299> throughout

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
to black ops 1 now further throughout

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.629 
to black ops 1 now further throughout
the<00:01:21.020> actual<00:01:21.439> video<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.829> get<00:01:22.099> more<00:01:22.310> zone

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:22.639 
the actual video you get more zone

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:25.059 
the actual video you get more zone
before<00:01:22.849> that<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.329> actually<00:01:23.539> see<00:01:24.319> I<00:01:24.679> believe

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
before that you actually see I believe

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.919 
before that you actually see I believe
one<00:01:25.639> of<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.789> maps<00:01:25.999> because<00:01:26.299> they<00:01:26.810> actually

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
one of the maps because they actually

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.080 
one of the maps because they actually
bring<00:01:27.349> zombies<00:01:27.829> up<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.219> then<00:01:28.729> they<00:01:28.819> start
