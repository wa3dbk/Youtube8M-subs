00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
for a while but this is something that's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.349 
for a while but this is something that's
brought<00:03:41.079> me<00:03:41.290> back<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.920> it's<00:03:42.609> it's

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
brought me back because it's it's

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.840 
brought me back because it's it's
something<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.109> earn<00:03:44.380> again<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.340> guess<00:03:45.639> they're

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
something to earn again I guess they're

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.699 
something to earn again I guess they're
there<00:03:46.030> are<00:03:46.180> new<00:03:46.329> things<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.810> unlock<00:03:47.200> because

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
there are new things to unlock because

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.220 
there are new things to unlock because
you're<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.819> yes<00:03:49.420> they<00:03:49.600> are<00:03:49.630> randomized

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you're you yes they are randomized

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.509 
you're you yes they are randomized
through<00:03:50.410> these<00:03:50.530> mystery<00:03:50.889> boxes<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.340> you're

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
through these mystery boxes but you're

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.710 
through these mystery boxes but you're
getting<00:03:51.670> new<00:03:51.940> stuff<00:03:52.000> you're<00:03:52.359> getting<00:03:52.569> new

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
getting new stuff you're getting new

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.199 
getting new stuff you're getting new
skins<00:03:53.139> I<00:03:53.530> think<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.519> actually<00:03:54.670> get<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
skins I think you can actually get the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.750 
skins I think you can actually get the
the<00:03:55.450> DLC<00:03:55.930> weapons<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> m82<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.579> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
the DLC weapons like the m82 in the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.610 
the DLC weapons like the m82 in the
gameplay<00:03:58.209> boxes<00:03:58.930> I'm<00:03:59.079> not<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> hundred<00:03:59.440> percent

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
gameplay boxes I'm not a hundred percent

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.110 
gameplay boxes I'm not a hundred percent
certain<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.639> I'm<00:04:00.700> pretty<00:04:00.880> sure<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
certain of that but I'm pretty sure I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.340 
certain of that but I'm pretty sure I
saw<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.569> pop<00:04:01.780> up<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
saw it pop up there in the like the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.530 
saw it pop up there in the like the
random<00:04:05.350> spinning<00:04:06.010> thing<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.940> basically

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
random spinning thing that basically

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.910 
random spinning thing that basically
whatever<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.930> UI<00:04:08.109> is<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.560> don't<00:04:08.620> know<00:04:08.709> how<00:04:08.829> to

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
whatever the UI is I don't know how to

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.770 
whatever the UI is I don't know how to
describe<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.459> but<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> fantastic

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
describe it but it's a fantastic

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.069 
describe it but it's a fantastic
addition<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.380> hope<00:04:12.250> gets<00:04:13.000> more<00:04:13.209> people<00:04:13.569> to

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.080 
addition that I hope gets more people to
return<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.590> game<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:14.889> play<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.340> maybe<00:04:15.850> as

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
return the game and play it and maybe as

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.729

other<00:04:16.269> people<00:04:16.660> have<00:04:17.139> been<00:04:17.289> picking<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.650> up

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
other people have been picking it up

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.020 
other people have been picking it up
because<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.160> been<00:04:18.310> seeing<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.729> lot<00:04:18.760> of

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
because I have been seeing a lot of

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.300 
because I have been seeing a lot of
newer<00:04:19.299> names<00:04:19.769> hopefully<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.919> helps<00:04:21.130> get

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
newer names hopefully that helps get

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.430

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
them hooked and keeps the community in

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.200 
them hooked and keeps the community in
this<00:04:23.530> game<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:23.950> because<00:04:24.190> killzone<00:04:24.640> 2<00:04:24.820> came

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
this game going because killzone 2 came

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.120 
this game going because killzone 2 came
out<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.450> 2009<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.890> think

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
out in 2009 and I think

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.190
