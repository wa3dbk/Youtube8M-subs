00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This will be complete Walkthrough.
Movies, cutscenes and dialogues won't be skipped.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:16.038
Alright, this mission is very easy.
The car will drive this route and stop by the restaurant.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.039
We can't just plant the bomb like that, because it's
guarded by Blue Lotus and Red Dragon members.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.040
Luckly for us, chauffeur will need to take a piss
in this place. I'll kill him there, change clothes
and hide the body in nearby sewer pit.

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:33.041
With chauffeur uniform I can plant the bomb
and quickly leave the area without any suspicion.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:38.042
Target will leave the restaurant and go this route.
There's three more Blue Lotus members in this place.
I'll detonate the bomb there and explosion will kill'em.

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:43.000
Then I'll go to Rendezvous Point to finish this mission.
All I need is my favourite Fiber Wire
and Car Bomb with Detonator.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.340
There are Blue Lotus members we must kill with explosion.
I'll detonate the bomb, when car will be at the corner.
And here's the car.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:12.295
Don't worry.
You don't have to hide yourself.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:31.084
Restaurant is closed for customers.
I'll check it out for you.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.390
In next parts I won't do any unnecessary movements.
That was the first and last time I did it.

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.391
Now follow the chauffeur.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
DO NOT ATTACK him so quick!!!
Always check if there's someone who see you.

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:00.001
Every civilian (or someone else) will respond immediately.
Guard will start shooting and alert others.
Civilian will alert guards.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:05.002
DO NOT KILL CIVILIANS!!!
You'll lose 5000$ for civilian casualty.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.900
See? There's 2 civilians who could see us killing
this guy. Wait until they'll be out of sight
and very quckly kill the driver.

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:19.901
Change clothes and quickly hide the body.
You can pick up his weapon if you want.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.340
Now go to the car and plant the bomb.

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:49.499
Choose Car Bomb from your inventory.
Don't worry - they won't notice,
that you have bomb in your hand.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.500
Click on driver's door and plant the bomb.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:14.382
Now let's change clothes again.
We don't wanna drive this car, right?

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:19.383
Remember to check out if no one's watching
before changing clothes.
23
00:04:42,560 --&gt; 00:00:47,560
As you can see they're waiting for the chauffeur.
They'll start shooting at us if we would be
in his uniform.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:57.727
"Where the fuck is he?"

00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:01.728
"Whatever. I'll drive."

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.500
Now choose Remote Detonator and wait for the car
nearby Rendezvous Point.

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:25.358
BLOW IT UP!!!

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:36.432
And we're done here.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:44.473
Mission completed in beautiful style!

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.748
Subtitles can be changed, so if y'all see
some errors, mistakes - write to me.
