00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
 Hello and welcome to the weather 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
 connected to youtube beamer 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.970
 tweet tachelmann and on facebook 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 tile man weather and weather tile man 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.099
 press.com 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.679
 exciting weather situation for the northeast 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.780
 Germany is already repeating itself 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.810
 a little bit with this one again 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.240
 moist warm glibber sauce air from the east 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 and there was already in this air 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 there are still today in the northeast 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.119
 partly powerful thunderstorms strong before 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.720
 all the rain concerns the problem 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.520
 in turn it draws infinitely slowly 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920
 that means if somewhere shift 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 also started a really longer time 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.790
 the same place and that is the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 problematic with these thunderstorms in the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 On the Saturday the whole thing comes 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.480
 going ahead westwards that is to say 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 on sunday even then focus 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 This local heavy rain and thunderstorms 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.190
 but I just caught all this 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.989
 get caught you know then never really in 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.539
 Flooded road sections drive 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 is to say about one north 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 Mittellandkanal line to Berlin 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 continue towards northeast and east 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 Tomorrow comes drier air from the east 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 this is the meaning of uecker 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 Randow circle up in the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.680
 Niederlausitz is then in the course of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 tomorrow morning more friendly and even 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.720
 really warm to well over 20 degrees 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.340
 again a breath of summer the big one 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.810
 rest of germany further south 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 little change to the east half 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 cloudy gray still a bit 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 Rain with every kilometer direction 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 southwest friendlier and more 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.810
 sun looks briefly to the east 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.759
 austria wiener basin 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 There it is a rather grisly one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.930
 bad weekend especially today 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840
 the saturday of sunday then already 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.759
 little less wet but hardly 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.710
 Loosening Monday's first shy 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.530
 relaxation and tuesday will be back 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.450
 much friendlier this week 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 not even in germany 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.689
 Bad temperature partly 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.869
 well over 20 degrees direction 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.780
 midweek also not 25 26 degrees 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.790
 excluded as in july 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.799
 August said the summer is not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 when all say the summer is over 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.189
 but that can also be done in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.899
 september good and happy again 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.000
 warm , if not for everyone 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.920
 the focus of the heat is the utmost 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
 southwest and also the northeast and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.010
 east 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.290
 Today, as always, there was in the newspaper 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.560
 from stupid for stupid even here the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 first winter forecast full post 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.069
 meteorology in tateinheit with 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 full cost I've journalism 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.430
 you do not have to write it 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.129
 Take it seriously now 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.349
 no longer the responsibility itself 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.360
 taken over but poor 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.370
 American weather services pushed 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.540
 which should have written in trend 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.790
 a degree warmer in the cut than normal 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.599
 the winter and that will be the same as 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.269
 majorca winter means interpreted 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.640
 nothing so first of all it is one 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.620
 purely experimental weather forecast that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.030
 can be very different to the winter 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.950
 Nothing stands for anything 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.069
 from this summer now this year 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.480
 It was also a degree too warm and many 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.060
 had the feeling that was actually 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.580
 an animal cold and rainy 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.019
 matter and 1 1 degree too warm 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.569
 winter when he really enters 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.390
 also means there may be 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.730
 few clear really cold nights that 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.430
 It is perhaps a right one 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 snowy cold winter but just 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.000
 from the temperatures not very 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.349
 cold winter and everyone would think so 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 we had a terrible winter 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.580
 not since a long time 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.310
 and because almost always the opposite 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.260
 entry of what the full post 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.640
 As a meteorologist I would say so 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.640
 just like that, though I do 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.980
 have no basis to say that at all 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.870
 The coming winter will be more intense than 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.610
 the last but as I said that is only 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.260
 because you entered the opposite I have 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.010
 No idea nobody has any idea 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.010
 Have a nice Weekend
