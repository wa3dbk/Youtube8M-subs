00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
came you see these little ice shelves

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.400 
came you see these little ice shelves
that<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.180> come<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.080> all

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that they come with they are all

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
that they come with they are all
interchangeable<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.880> them<00:00:27.000> all

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
interchangeable you can take them all

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390 
interchangeable you can take them all
apart<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.689> make<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.349> big<00:00:28.619> ice<00:00:28.830> shelf<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
apart you can make one big ice shelf and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.550 
apart you can make one big ice shelf and
maybe<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> end<00:00:29.910> I'll<00:00:30.210> show<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.449> off<00:00:30.840> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
maybe at the end I'll show that off but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.630 
maybe at the end I'll show that off but
right<00:00:31.740> now<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.070> gonna<00:00:32.219> look<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.369> these<00:00:32.460> guys

right now we're gonna look at these guys

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
right now we're gonna look at these guys
individually<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.630> we'll<00:00:33.780> start<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.380> with

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
individually and we'll start it off with

individually and we'll start it off with
Sid<00:00:35.540> all<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:37.110> each<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:37.620> packages

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
Sid all right each one of these packages

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.080 
Sid all right each one of these packages
they<00:00:39.180> came<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> figure<00:00:40.590> which<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.370> Sid<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
they came with a figure which is Sid now

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
they came with a figure which is Sid now
this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> removable<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:43.920> got

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this is removable and you see they got

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
this is removable and you see they got
some<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> holes<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> bottom<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
some of the holes on the bottom it can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
some of the holes on the bottom it can
go<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> stand

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
go here you can go here he can stand

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
go here you can go here he can stand
here<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> these<00:00:48.809> pieces<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.440> ice

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
here on any one of these pieces of ice

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.180 
here on any one of these pieces of ice
shelf

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
shelf

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
shelf
it<00:00:50.520> says<00:00:50.789> ice<00:00:50.969> age<00:00:51.270> continental<00:00:51.570> drift<00:00:51.930> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it says ice age continental drift on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
it says ice age continental drift on
there<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.129> these<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
there and then these things all like I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
there and then these things all like I
say<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.870> come<00:00:54.899> apart<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.920> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
say they can all come apart we can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.819 
say they can all come apart we can
interconnect<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> will<00:00:57.360> end<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.930> just

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
interconnect them and I will end up just

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.760 
interconnect them and I will end up just
adding<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> big<00:00:59.629> conglomeration<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> ice<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
adding a big conglomeration of ice in a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
adding a big conglomeration of ice in a
little<00:01:02.010> bit<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> end<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.300> show<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
little bit at the end we will show it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
little bit at the end we will show it
off<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.170> combined<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.400> number<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
off all combined but number one and the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.070 
off all combined but number one and the
set<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.869> Sid<00:01:08.060> number<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> set<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
set is Sid number two of the set is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.789 
set is Sid number two of the set is
scrapped<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.580> looks<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.119> Scott<00:01:12.750> has<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
scrapped and it looks like Scott has the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.249 
scrapped and it looks like Scott has the
Acorn<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.460> chases<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.450> every

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Acorn he chases that thing around every

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
Acorn he chases that thing around every
movie<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> never<00:01:17.909> seems<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> really

movie they have never seems to really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.590 
movie they have never seems to really
get<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:20.189> he's<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> little

little details here his face is just
painted<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.750> again<00:01:28.560> there's<00:01:28.920> different<00:01:28.950> ports

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
painted on again there's different ports

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
painted on again there's different ports
where<00:01:29.700> he<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.970> plug<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.590> the

where he can plug them in and all the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.679 
where he can plug them in and all the
little<00:01:31.950> ice<00:01:32.159> shelves<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.850> uniquely<00:01:33.420> colored

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
little ice shelves are uniquely colored

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
little ice shelves are uniquely colored
too<00:01:34.079> which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> nice<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:34.890> then

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
too which is kind of nice because then

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
too which is kind of nice because then
you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.270> ones<00:01:36.600> went<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.380> which

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you know which ones went with which

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.310 
you know which ones went with which
originally<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.030> here's<00:01:39.210> Scrat<00:01:39.659> he<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.020> number

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
originally so here's Scrat he is number

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.700 
originally so here's Scrat he is number

mammoth and it looks like he's on two
legs<00:01:46.649> there<00:01:46.979> looks<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> those

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
legs there looks like it's kind of those
