the<00:02:15.440> tick<00:02:15.650> from<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.069> comic<00:02:16.370> series<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:16.879> also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the tick from the comic series and also

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.699

the<00:02:17.209> TV<00:02:17.480> show<00:02:17.599> series<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:18.200> hard<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.470> tell

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the TV show series really hard to tell

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.199 
the TV show series really hard to tell
and<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.069> really<00:02:19.400> hard<00:02:19.670> because<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
and it's really hard because of the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
lighting and everything but I think it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.800 
lighting and everything but I think it
is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.489> tick<00:02:22.700> that's<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.299> small<00:02:23.420> Easter

that come back and mess everything up
but<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:02.629> do<00:03:02.750> believe<00:03:03.290> reverse<00:03:04.159> flash<00:03:04.459> is

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
but I do believe reverse flash is

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.910 
but I do believe reverse flash is
somebody<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.079> we're<00:03:06.349> not<00:03:06.500> gonna<00:03:06.590> at<00:03:06.769> least

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
somebody that we're not gonna at least

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.860 
somebody that we're not gonna at least
expect<00:03:07.340> Eddie<00:03:07.579> Thawne<00:03:07.909> doesn't<00:03:08.359> really<00:03:08.510> seem

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
expect Eddie Thawne doesn't really seem

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.449 
expect Eddie Thawne doesn't really seem
like<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.500> because<00:03:09.829> he<00:03:10.159> doesn't<00:03:10.340> know

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
like it just because he doesn't know

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.930 
like it just because he doesn't know
anything

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
anything

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.180 
anything
and<00:03:11.060> then<00:03:11.480> he's<00:03:11.870> catching<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.440> what<00:03:12.709> Barry's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and then he's catching all what Barry's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
and then he's catching all what Barry's
doing<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.819> these<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.299> things<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.660> how

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
doing like these little things like how

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.449 
doing like these little things like how
did<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:14.989> get<00:03:15.139> in<00:03:15.260> front<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.500> me<00:03:15.590> or<00:03:15.739> how<00:03:16.340> did

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you hit this really hard like eventually

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.289 
you hit this really hard like eventually
Barry<00:03:19.099> didn't<00:03:19.430> get<00:03:19.549> caught<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.209> gonna

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
Barry didn't get caught and it's gonna

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.569 
Barry didn't get caught and it's gonna
mess<00:03:20.540> him<00:03:20.630> up<00:03:20.840> each<00:03:21.470> episode<00:03:21.799> where<00:03:22.430> we're

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
mess him up each episode where we're

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.640 
mess him up each episode where we're
watching<00:03:22.730> flash<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.660> just<00:03:24.109> getting<00:03:24.380> stronger

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
watching flash is just getting stronger

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.440 
watching flash is just getting stronger
and<00:03:24.950> stronger<00:03:25.220> should<00:03:25.609> I<00:03:25.669> or<00:03:25.879> should<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.239> say

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
and stronger should I or should I say

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.720 
and stronger should I or should I say
faster<00:03:26.900> faster<00:03:27.319> because<00:03:27.650> he's<00:03:28.190> pushing<00:03:28.579> his

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
faster faster because he's pushing his

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.580 
faster faster because he's pushing his
limits<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.569> think<00:03:29.840> that's<00:03:30.019> what<00:03:30.139> Harrison

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
limits and I think that's what Harrison

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.680 
limits and I think that's what Harrison
wells<00:03:30.859> wants<00:03:31.340> him<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.579> do<00:03:31.700> he<00:03:31.849> wants<00:03:32.120> him<00:03:32.239> to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
wells wants him to do he wants him to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.379 
wells wants him to do he wants him to
push<00:03:32.930> himself<00:03:33.139> better<00:03:34.010> than<00:03:34.669> the<00:03:34.879> old<00:03:35.090> flash

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
push himself better than the old flash

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.210 
push himself better than the old flash
in<00:03:35.660> his<00:03:35.690> future<00:03:36.139> probably<00:03:36.560> did<00:03:36.769> I'm<00:03:37.069> gonna

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
in his future probably did I'm gonna

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.860 
in his future probably did I'm gonna
