00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.240
 said look what I just found 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.830
 it's heartbreaking 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 could not have discovered anything else 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 no 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980
 Oh 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.890
 we start this week with a good 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.000
 french franco reference calls 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.500
 what is Belgium waiting for moulinsart les 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.700
 dupond dupont of his climbs this because 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.980
 that he does not have a wand and a beret 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.810
 who is not french and tintin you 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.060
 know this strange feeling that is going 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.430
 to happen something horrible about 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.930
 kind of seeing the box but if you 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.370
 know it's that feeling you have 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.050
 played at a horror pre a game of 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.460
 gasoline platform fell into 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.680
 the void and die in places 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.410
 improbable winger whore 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.180
 future and will be played like a 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.490
 kind of cruel punishment that you 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.900
 inflict laugh shot a concentrate of 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.850
 all the worst in games 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.590
 of platform although at the first level 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.040
 watch this and I have to go take 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.900
 the plane 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.130
 the locomotive but yet I can not 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.770
 go there I do not want to jump far enough 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.810
 I spent at least 30 minutes trying 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.970
 before I understand that this little thing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.160
 that we see there is actually informing you 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.750
 on which one can jump no but 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.100
 seriously commented supposed to know that it's 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.119
 a platform while that exactly 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.119
 at the same time as the rest 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.500
 back to the hotel I have to go 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.300
 look for a letter at the reception 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 while the dogs the cooks and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.770
 housekeeping and it's killing me 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 probably the worst hotel that exists 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.210
 in the world 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.650
 and here it is typical that's how 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.930
 I spend his cooks that make you 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.520
 touch I tap you advanced to the first 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 plan and his program to jump by 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.040
 on it I just have to go over and over 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:08.709
 to kill me 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:15.310
 and in addition they see the best campaign 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.510
 seriously serious bessat gloves 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 that's exactly what I want 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.970
 speak 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.100
 this game is a concentrate of frustration 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.340
 and totally impossible screen action 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.340
 to achieve 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.160
 millions of thousand ports 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.570
 after avoiding killer cooks 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.190
 I arrive at the reception to hear it 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.930
 to say that he had already entrusted the letter 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.510
 to the captain you could not say it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.540
 before fucking a package maybe the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.520
 january kent whiskey and a 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.410
 new yeah finally saw that you ads 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.350
 with a big smile his pair of 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 really piss off one en route to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.500
 nepal so you know it's really 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.940
 there we start to understand that 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.040
 something our and not in this 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.290
 game I mean a dog to do you 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.700
 badly I want to believe he wants he was going 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 look at but why is earth 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.600
 murders snapped up by a bell 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.790
 how does a stress that weighs 10 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:16.770
 g talent can you be a man of 25 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:18.390
 years old so I find a kid who is going 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.070
 indicate the way he asks me to 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.380
 to follow it is not necessary to speak so much better 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:31.830
 it's less far 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:35.239
 allocated or next year but it is 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.239
 where there he went left for parents 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.349
 well we talked a little bit about the spirit of the game 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.939
 there is no problem the graphics me 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.040
 make the world of the band pretty good 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.930
 cartoon of hergÃ© and the story tries to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.640
 follow relatively the course of the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.560
 cartoon but there are times where 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.230
 really it's downright too much you 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.940
 remember 700 captain haddock movies 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.769

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.140

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.010

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.010
 indifferent 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.770
 4 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.770
 you see 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.940
 there is the same thing in the game except that 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.520
 the apple is 20 km long and 450 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:44.789
 status to pass fucking it was well worth the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.620
 worth climbing so high oh fucking the 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.080
 Pebble 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.110

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.319

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.319
 left 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.010
 god will make really exist sugar to who 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.500
 we know this game this game is a 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.080
 festival the difficulty to spend the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.730
 different levels is really 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.570
 legendary you just know 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.790
 impossible 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.560
 and again I play in easy mode and 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.540
 as if that was not enough there is a word 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.420
 only pass all five levels 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.450
 but why all five levels 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.400
 why not at all lgv she you 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.160
 do not find the game already it's impossible 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.900
 like that seriously are the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.100
 developers was just too lazy 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:47.660
 to put a password on every 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:49.520
 level fucking look at this but it's 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.590
 just unachievable is this young 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.240
 man was designed for kids who 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.610
 look at the adventures of tintin on 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.010
 france 3 how is a kid of 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.750
 10 years can successfully finish this game then 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.750
 like myself I can not do it 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.780
 why these morons saint-seine mes 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.780
 friends always give up at the beginning 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.870
 why is there a chasm in 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.790
 a plane why is this game so cruel 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.190
 look simple if you do not fall 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.889
 exactly stack in the middle of 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.570
 platforms will go through more 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.300
 the story of the game moves forward and more 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.340
 progresses in the unattainable the looks 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.040
 and I have to use the wind to jump 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.870
 further and as I come to the end there 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.610
 no way to go further 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.310
 the pure marches my balls and I 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.010
 more than to commit suicide a sad good 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.419
 end after climbing the himalaya good 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.860
 I guess they must then jumped in 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.449
 face and uncheck a room and at the same 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.130
 time but damn but why is this 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.840
 that it must be so hard but it's that 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.090
 the game is not a simulation for 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.740
 fighter pilot take the rope from the 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.310
 share of shadow for playing a seat 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.960

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.020
 I 'm sorry I spent so much 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.380
 time to play I'm starting to dream
