00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
recommend is that you use it after any

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
recommend is that you use it after any

distortion devices the reason for this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.860 
distortion devices the reason for this
is<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:13.860> maintain<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.910> sound<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.569> your

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
is you can maintain the sound of your

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.820

your<00:02:17.760> distortion<00:02:18.390> or<00:02:18.540> overdrive<00:02:18.620> devices<00:02:19.620> and

your distortion or overdrive devices and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
your distortion or overdrive devices and
then<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.489> can<00:02:20.670> use<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.000> boost<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.510> simply

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
then you can use the boost to simply

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
then you can use the boost to simply
take<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.140> sound<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.010> either<00:02:23.610> boost<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.090> or

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
take that sound and either boost it or

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.449 
take that sound and either boost it or
you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.050> take<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.380> sound<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> attenuate<00:02:26.430> it
