alright<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.570> rule<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> move<00:00:22.199> no<00:00:22.590> point

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
alright first rule of the move no point

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.980 
alright first rule of the move no point
guards<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.580> simply<00:00:24.060> aren't<00:00:24.269> athletic

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
guards they simply aren't athletic

guards they simply aren't athletic
enough<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.289> finish<00:00:25.470> afterwards<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.580> want

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
enough to finish afterwards so you want

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.220 
enough to finish afterwards so you want
to<00:00:26.910> use<00:00:27.029> athletic<00:00:27.570> wings<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.019> move

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
to use athletic wings with this move

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
to use athletic wings with this move
like<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> model<00:00:28.890> Roseanna<00:00:29.250> Kobe<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.939> same

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
move pulls it off he's gonna dunk it on

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
move pulls it off he's gonna dunk it on
them<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.059> make<00:00:33.239> sure<00:00:33.390> no<00:00:33.600> point<00:00:33.840> guards<00:00:34.110> now

let's<00:00:34.920> look<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> slow<00:00:35.430> motion<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
let's look at the slow motion and the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
let's look at the slow motion and the
science<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> moves<00:00:39.170> right<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> set<00:00:40.710> up

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
science of the moves right so to set up

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
science of the moves right so to set up
the<00:00:40.950> move<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> call<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> quick

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the move you want to call a quick

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
the move you want to call a quick
isolation<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:44.309> gonna<00:00:44.399> do

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
isolation first and then you're gonna do

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
isolation first and then you're gonna do
a<00:00:44.640> turbo<00:00:45.000> halt<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.510> something<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> taught<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a turbo halt so something I taught you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.389 
a turbo halt so something I taught you
guys<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> dribble<00:00:46.829> dance<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.340> you

about that one more time so here's the
turbo<00:00:56.969> flick<00:00:57.210> hop<00:00:57.510> rice<00:00:58.079> stick<00:00:58.289> flick<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
turbo flick hop rice stick flick to the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
turbo flick hop rice stick flick to the
left<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> left<00:01:00.270> stick<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.020> just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
turning this corner you want to stay

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.789 
turning this corner you want to stay
away<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.869> sorts<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.260> physical<00:01:07.380> contact

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
away from all sorts of physical contact

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
away from all sorts of physical contact
so<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> won't<00:01:08.520> start<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
so if you won't start any kind of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
so if you won't start any kind of
animation<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:10.530> sure<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.799> stay<00:01:10.950> away

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
animation so make sure you stay away

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
animation so make sure you stay away
from<00:01:11.130> contact<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> reach<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> point

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
from contact and as you reach this point

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
from contact and as you reach this point
if<00:01:13.229> he's<00:01:13.350> running<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.770> parallel<00:01:14.159> let

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
if he's running over your parallel let

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
if he's running over your parallel let
everything<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.090> let<00:01:15.299> every<00:01:15.540> button<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
everything go let every button go and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
everything go let every button go and
then<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.830> half<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> second<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
then for half a second and then do it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
then for half a second and then do it
behind<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> back<00:01:18.920> then<00:01:19.920> turbo<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.430> Dunkin

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
behind the back then turbo and Dunkin

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.080 
behind the back then turbo and Dunkin
on'em

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on'em

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.249 
on'em
now<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.479> watchin<00:01:21.689> real<00:01:21.869> speed<00:01:22.110> we're

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
now that's watchin real speed we're

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
now that's watchin real speed we're
gonna<00:01:22.409> hop<00:01:22.619> across<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.580> left<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> right<00:01:23.939> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gonna hop across from left to right with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
gonna hop across from left to right with
turbo<00:01:24.270> stay<00:01:24.509> away<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:24.720> contact<00:01:25.080> that

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.089 
chance now every great basketball move
has<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> counter<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.709> does<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.980> family

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099

after the stunner

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.330 
after the stunner
so<00:02:48.449> if<00:02:48.659> you<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.349> they<00:02:49.469> cut<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.919> off<00:02:50.099> on
